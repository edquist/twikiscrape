---+ 2015 OSG User School Infrastructure

This page is primarily for instructors and sysadmins to document the computing infrastructure for the School.

Appropriately, the School infrastructure is distributed between sites, mostly based on who is teaching what.

---++ Submit Nodes

---+++ UW–Madison Local Submit Node

*Purpose:* Allow submissions to the local cluster and, using HTCondor-G, to the local and remote CEs.

*Use:* Students login directly to this machine to do most of their work, especially on Monday.  Will also be used on Wed. for storage exercises, hence the httpd server.

| *Hostname* | osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu |
| *OS* | Scientific Linux release 6.3 (Carbon) |
| *Packages* | osg-client, httpd |
| *Logins* | Students, Instructors |
| *Contacts* | Aaron Moate &amp;lt;moate@cs.wisc.edu&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Neil Van Lysel &amp;lt;van-lyse@cs.wisc.edu&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Nate Yehle &amp;lt;nyehle@cs.wisc.edu&amp;gt; |

---+++ !GlideinWMS Submit Node

*Purpose:*  Allow submissions to a glideinWMS enabled system.

*Use:* Students login directly to this machine to do glideinWMS-related work, especially on Tuesday. 

| *Hostname* | osg-glidein-submit |
| *OS* | SL6 |
| *Packages* | HTCondor + glideinWMS |
| *Logins* | Students, Instructors |

---++ Storage Elements

---+++ HTTP Proxy Host

| *Hostname* | proxy.chtc.wisc.edu |
| *OS* | |
| *Packages* | Squid |
| *Logins* | N/A |

---+++ Storage Element for !GridFTP / SRM Exercises

*Purpose:* Do we still need this if we&#39;re going to avoid using certificates at all? An OSG SE that provides SRM and !GridFTP interfaces for the exercises.

| *Hostname* | uct2-dc1.uchicago.edu |
| *OS* | Scientific Linux 5.5 |
| *Packages* | dcache-2.6.30-1 |
| *Logins* | — |

---++ Local Worker Nodes

The CHTC pool may have some slots reserved for jobs coming from osg-ss-submit, but that is not settled yet. More details available later.

---++No Longer Needed as of 2015:

---++ Compute Element (CE)

*Purpose:* A standard OSG CE for demonstrating the use of Condor-G.

*Use:* This machine is part of the grid discussion on Tuesday. Students do not use it directly, but Igor demonstrates jobs running via Condor-G with it.

---++ General Information for 2012 from Alain Roy

The machines were managed with Puppet. Dan gave me a script to create accounts for the students and instructors. I *think* it made the users on one machine (perhaps the CE) and Puppet copied it everywhere in an hour. But I am not 100% certain how it worked.

The site is registered with the GOC, so if you change or update the site in interesting ways (new CE hostname or whatever) you need to tell them about it:

http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/search?q=WISC-OSG-EDU-2&amp;type=resource

What should we do next year? We could just lightly update the existing VMs and move on. But when we bought the new VM server machine for the VDT, the thought was that it could support both the OSG-EDU site and an ITB site. I think that&#39;s no problem. So an ideal world with lots of available effort, we&#39;d move to it and decommission the old VMs.
