---+ OSG-Associated Training Events and Workshops

The OSG Education area aims to provide and support activities in Distributed High Throughput Computing (DHTC) and other associated topics for researchers and students in a variety of fields, including the natural and applied sciences, social sciences, engineering, and computer science. Working with leading experts in grid computing, participants learn essential skills to conduct and support scientific analysis in DHTC environments through a blend of lectures, discussions, and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources.
