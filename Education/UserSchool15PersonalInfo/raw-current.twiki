---+ Personal Information Requirements

&lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;If your travel, lodging, *and* personal meal expenses are covered by someone other than the School, this page does not apply to you!&lt;/span&gt;

In order for the University of Wisconsin to pay for your travel, hotel, or meal expenses, we must have certain personal information from you. We will collect as little information as possible and not share it with anyone except University administrative staff who need it.

Read the section headings below and read the details of the *first* section that applies to you – and most people are covered by the first section.

---++ You Are a United States Resident and/or Have a Social Security Number

If you are a United States citizen, permanent resident, or resident for tax purposes – basically, if you have a U.S. Social Security number – then we will need the following information:

   * Full legal name
   * Mailing address
   * Last four digits of your Social Security number

If we need this information, we should have received it as part of your acceptance to the School, in which case you are done! Otherwise, contact us to see how to proceed.

---++ Non-Resident Aliens

When you come to the School in Madison, we will need to look at and verify your travel documents. Please bring all travel documents to the School!

---+++ Non-Resident Alien Tasks To Do Now

Please check your passport and visa for travel in the United States now. Make sure that all documents are valid from now and until after the School. If any documents are expired or will expire before the end of the School:

   * Tell us immediately, so that we can help you
   * Begin the process for updating your documents immediately
   * Do whatever you can to expedite the update process

The University of Wisconsin cannot pay for or reimburse you for costs without valid travel documents. We have no control over this policy and there are no exceptions.

      * If you entered the U.S. after 30 April 2013, the I-94 is stored electronically; [[https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/request.html][you can request a copy to print from CBP]]

Additionally, if you have an *F-1 (Student)* visa, we need Form I-20 as well; if you have a *J-1 (Visitor)* visa, we need Form DS-2019.
