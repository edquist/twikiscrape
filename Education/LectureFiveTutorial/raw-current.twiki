---+!! Tutorial: Grid Resources and Job Management
Earlier, we learned about Condor-G and DAGMan.  Now we will submit some simple jobs using these components.

In the exercises below, students should select one from the list of gridlab hosts (e.g., gridlab2, gridlab3, or gridlab4, at random) to use throughout the exercise, rather than all choosing gridlab2. Use the host you select &amp;mdash; gridlab2, gridlab3 or gridlab4 &amp;mdash; whenever the notes say &quot;gridlab2&quot;.
