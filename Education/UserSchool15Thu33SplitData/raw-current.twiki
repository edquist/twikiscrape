---+ Exercise 3.3 : Multiple query files

In the previous exercises (Exercise 3.1  and 3.2), we focused on how to do a BLAST search against a database that has been split up.  This exercise will generalize this to using multiple query files.  We&#39;ll use two different query files =HLA.txt= and =BRAC1.txt= and create a set of jobs that&#39;ll query both those files. The job submission files are generated through ==blast_gen.bash== script, open this file up and update it so that it&#39;ll create job submission script for both query files.  Then submit the queries, and check the outputs to make sure that it is running the BLAST search correctly.


---++ Additional information

In the blast search example, we utilized a bash script to take care of submitting multiple jobs. A better alternative is to utilize the workflow manager such as DAGMan or Pegasus since workflow managers will automatically retry failed jobs and handle data transfers between jobs for you.  We&#39;ve covered DAGMan earlier this week, if you&#39;d like to see Pegasus in use, you can look at  https://github.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-pegasus-blast.
