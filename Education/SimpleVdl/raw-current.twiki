---+!! Simple VDL
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

In this exercise, you will write your own VDL to run one step in the QuarkNet? problem code, which takes the processed data and generates a graph.

You are provided with:
   * the input data files for this step, =simplevdl-extra= and =simplevdl-freqs=. (These are the same as some of the intermediate files that were generated in your =PROBINTRO/= directory). These have already been registered with the replica location system (which you will see in greater depth in a later exercise);
   * a transformation definition that defines how to use =Plot.pl= from the =&lt;nop&gt;QuarkCode/= directory to convert input data files into a graph, in =transform.vdl=;
   * a template file =simple.vdl.template= for the derivation.

Armed with these tools, you will need to write a derivation which uses the supplied transformation on the supplied data files to produce the output graph.

Copy the =SIMPLEVDL/= directory into your workspace, and use the supplied template to make a =simple.vdl= file:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cp -av /opt/vdltut/SIMPLEVDL ~&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cd ~/SIMPLEVDL/&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cp simple.vdl.template simple.vdl&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vi simple.vdl &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% Or use any text editor you choose.

In the last step using vi, modify the derivation so that =@USER@= is replaced with =trainXX= in all three places that it occurs.

Now try compiling, planning and running your workflow:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vdlc simple.vdl transform.vdl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;20060609T152414.181: [app] using label &quot;simple&quot;
20060609T152414.182: [app] using output file &quot;simple.dax&quot;
$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vds-plan --pegasus -g QuarkCode --option pools=local --option output=local --option force simple.dax --base ./dags&lt;/span&gt;
[...]
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;2006.06.09 19:18:14.059 PDT: [INFO] Time taken to execute is 1.029 seconds

I have concretized your abstract workflow. The workflow has been entered
into the workflow database with a state of &quot;planned&quot;. The next step is 
to start or execute your workflow. The invocation required is

vds-run  /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vds-run /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017&lt;/span&gt;
[...]
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;I have started your workflow, committed it to DAGMan, and updated its
state in the work database. A separate daemon was started to collect
information about the progress of the workflow. The job state will soon
be visible. Your workflow runs in base directory

cd /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cd /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;tail -f tailstatd.log&lt;/span&gt;
[... output over time ...]

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cd /nfs/scratch01/train02/QuarkCode/vdsuser-2/simple/run0017/&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cp simplevdl-myuser9999.png ~/public_html/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
