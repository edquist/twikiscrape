---+!! Compound VDL
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

In this exercise, you will combine the transforms of the previous section into a single compound transform. When you have done this, you will be able to invoke the entire analysis process using  a single derivation.


The files for this exercise are in the =/opt/vdltut/COMPOUNDVDL/= directory.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cp -av /opt/vdltut/COMPOUNDVDL/ ~&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cd ~/COMPOUNDVDL/ ~&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;compound.vdl.template  transformations.vdl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The most interesting file here is =compound.vdl=. This  takes the various different transformations that we did separately in the previous exercise, and makes a single transform. Then instead of specifying many derivations, we can specify just a single derivation to run the whole analysis.

Copy the =compound.vdl.template= template file, and substitute in =@USER@= at each occurence.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cp compound.vdl.template compound.vdl&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vim compound.vdl&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vdlc compound.vdl transformations.vdl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;20060531T121629.999: [app] using label &quot;compound&quot;
20060531T121630.011: [app] using output file &quot;compound.dax&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

At this point, a file called =compound.dax= should have  been generated. Look inside and see that it is very similar to =biggervdl.dax=, the DAX file from the earlier section.

Now plan and run the workflow:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vds-plan --pegasus -g QuarkCode --option pools=local --option output=local --option force compound.dax --base ./dags&lt;/span&gt;
[...] &lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;

I have concretized your abstract workflow. The workflow has been entered
into the workflow database with a state of &quot;planned&quot;. The next step is 
to start or execute your workflow. The invocation required is

vds-run  /home/train99/COMPOUNDVDL/dags/QuarkCode/compound/run0002&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;vds-run /home/train99/COMPOUNDVDL/dags/QuarkCode/compound/run0002&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;I have started your workflow, committed it to DAGMan, and updated its
state in the work database. A separate daemon was started to collect
information about the progress of the workflow. The job state will soon
be visible. Your workflow runs in base directory

cd /home/train99/COMPOUNDVDL/dags/QuarkCode/compound/run0002&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cd /home/train99/COMPOUNDVDL/dags/QuarkCode/compound/run0002&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;$ tail -f tailstatd.log &lt;/span&gt;
[...wait...]
&lt;span class=&quot;out&quot;&gt;20060611T172658.603 [327]: DAGMan finished with exit code 0
20060611T172658.603 [328]: processed chunk of 1095 byte

&lt;/pre&gt;

Now look at your plot.

On your local laptop, run:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;scp train99@gridlab1:/scratch/train99/QuarkCode/vdsuser-2/compound/run0002/train99-plot.png .&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;open train99-plot.png&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
