---+++ Objective of this exercise
This is an optional exercise introducing the Pegasus workflow management system. The object is to launch the Pegasus tutorial virtual machine, become familiar with basic Pegasus concepts and tools, and run a few simple workflows.
&lt;/div&gt;

---++ Pegasus Overview

Pegasus is a component on top of Condor and is used to run large DAGs (workflows) using Condor DAGMan. Pegasus comes with a set of tools to improve monitoring/debugging (pegasus-status and pegasus-analyzer), and statistics (pegasus-stats and pegasus-plots). Workflows in Pegasus are described in an abstract way by the user - this provides the feature of moving workflows between different resources. Pegasus automatically locates the necessary input data and computational resources necessary for workflow execution, and adds data management steps to the workflow to stage and track data.

Pegasus has been used in a number of scientific domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science , gravitational wave physics, ocean science, limnology, and others. When errors occur, Pegasus tries to recover when possible by retrying tasks, by retrying the entire workflow, by providing workflow-level checkpointing, by re-mapping portions of the workflow, by trying alternative data sources for staging data, and, when all else fails, by providing a rescue workflow containing a description of only the work that remains to be done. It cleans up storage as the workflow is executed so that data-intensive workflows have enough space to execute on storage-constrained resources. Pegasus keeps track of what has been done (provenance) including the locations of data used and produced, and which software was used with which parameters.

---++ Pegasus Tutorial Virtual Machine

This exercise is based on the Pegasus tutorial virtual machine. The reason a virtual machine is uses is that it provides a self contained environment for you to do the exercises in. The tutorial can be found at: [[http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/4.0/tutorial_vm.php]]

If you have any questions or problems, please feel free to contact the Pegasus team by emailing pegasus-support@isi.edu
