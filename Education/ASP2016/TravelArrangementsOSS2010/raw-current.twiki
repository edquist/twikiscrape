   * *Hotel*: We will pay for hotel directly.
   * *Meals in Madison, WI*: We will provide breakfast, lunch, and two group dinners (Sunday &amp; Thursday). You will need to pay for the other dinners and we will reimburse you for up to $20/day.

Details about how to receive your reimbursement will be provided when you arrive at the school.
   * *Meals while traveling*: Unfortunately, we cannot cover meals while traveling.

   * Full name
   * Email address you check regularly
   * Arrival date (For most of you, this should be July 18th)
   * Departure date (For most of you, this should be July 23rd)
   * City/Airport you will depart from
   * If you are traveling internationally, you&#39;ll also need:
      * Kind of visa
      * Scanned copy of visa
      * Copy of I-9, if you get one when you arrive in the US.

Please make your air travel arrangements as soon as possible. If possible, please keep your air fare under $500. (International travel excluded.)

---++ Travel for the !TeraGrid Conference
For those of you also traveling to the !TeraGrid conference (most of you), you should schedule your air travel and hotel with Peggy at the same time. 

---++ Hotel Arrangements OSG Summer School
Once we have your confirmation that you will be coming to the school, we will organize hotel for you if you are from out of town. You only need to email us, gridschool-2010-info@opensciencegrid.org, with your itinerary. We&#39;d like your itinerary because we&#39;ll try to arrange for the hotel shuttle to pick up groups of you when you arrive at the airport. 

We will make hotel reservations, but only for the nights of July 18-22. (That is, arriving on the 18th and checking out on the 23rd.) If you want to come earlier or stay later, you will need to make separate arrangements. Because we are paying for your hotel directly, you must make a separate reservation if you wish to extend your stay.

We will cover your basic hotel cost. However, when you check in you will need to provide a credit card. This will cover any additional expenses you have on top of the room cost, such as meals in the hotel restaurant, movies, etc.

---++ International Students
If you are not a US citizen, you must bring your passport, visa or green card, and I-9 with you to the school. This is required for us to process your reimbursements.
