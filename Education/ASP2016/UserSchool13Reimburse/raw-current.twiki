---+ Getting Reimbursed for Expenses

If your offer to join the 2013 OSG User School included financial support from us, and if you had expenses that were not paid for you, then you probably want to know how to be reimbursed for those expenses. Expenses that can be reimbursed are:

   * Bus travel from a nearby airport (Milwaukee, Chicago) to Madison (and back)
   * Driving mileage to/from Madison, if arranged in advance
   * Dinners on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings during the School

To get reimbursed, read this whole page carefully.

*Note:* All reimbursements will be handled by staff at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). But the School staff at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (UW) will need a copy of your request and will approve the expenses and amounts before UCSD processes them.

---++ Rules for Reimbursement

Be sure that you understand what can and cannot be reimbursed *BEFORE* you send us your expenses. If we receive expenses that do not fit within the rules, the process takes much longer.

---+++ Bus Travel

If you took a bus from a nearby airport (Milwaukee or Chicago) to Madison and back, and if you discussed your travel plan with us in advance, we should be able to reimburse you. UCSD’s travel rules state that ground expenses of $75 or more require a receipt. However, it would be best to include a receipt, including:

   * Complete itinerary
   * Your name
   * Date of purchase
   * Total amount paid

---+++ Driving Mileage

If you drove to/from the School, and if you discussed with us in advance your driving plans, we will reimburse you for the agreed-upon amount.

---+++ Dinners

Your offer of financial support for the School included meals. We provided dinner on Sunday evening, breakfasts and lunches Monday through Thursday, and dinner on Thursday. You were on your own for dinners Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and we will reimburse you for them. The rules for meals are:

   * Keep receipts for your dinners
   * Do not exceed $17 per dinner, including tax and tip (no more than 15% tip)
   * We cannot pay for any alcohol, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK; if your receipt includes alcohol, mark it clearly and do not include it (or its tax) in the final amount

If you do not have your receipts, please do your best to estimate your meal expenses accurately, up to the $17/dinner limit. Remember, all of your meal reimbursements are being paid by federal taxpayer funds, so be fair and honest!


---++ Reimbursement Process

This is the complete process for requesting and getting your reimbursement, to the best of our knowledge at this time. Please follow it carefully for best results!

   1. &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are not set up in the UCSD/SDSC travel system, contact them to set you up.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of you did this step already before the School by talking to Chris B. on the phone. If so, move on to the next step. Otherwise, email Sonia Nayak &lt;s1nayak@sdsc.edu&gt; to arrange a time for a phone call, and then she will set you up. Before calling Sonia, you will need the following information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your name, to put on the reimbursement check&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email address that you check regularly (ideally matching the one that we have)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social Security Number or U.S. visa information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Telephone number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your birthdate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mailing address where reimbursement should be sent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

All receipts and supporting&lt;br/&gt;documentation are attached.&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. &lt;p&gt;OSG staff at UW–Madison will review your request and either approve it or send it back for changes.&lt;/p&gt;
