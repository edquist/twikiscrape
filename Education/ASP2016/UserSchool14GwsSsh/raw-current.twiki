---+ 2014 OSG User School - Send Igor your public ssh key

The Tuesday exercises will run on a node that only accepts [[http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html][SSH public key mechanism]] for authentication.

Please send your public ssh key (as an attachment), alongside your account name, to Igor at [[mailto:isfiligoi_at_ucsd.edu][isfiligoi@ucsd.edu]] by Monday evening, so your accounts can be activated in time.

---++ Where to find the ssh public key

If you use Linux or OS&amp;nbsp;X, your public ssh key will be in a file named
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don&#39;t have that file yet, see instructions below on how to create it.

If you use Windows, it depends which ssh client you use.

---++ How to create an ssh key on Linux or OS&amp;nbsp;X

Create the ~/.ssh directory, if it does not exist yet:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use ssh-keygen to create the actual file:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
ssh-keygen -t rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;
You should provide a password to encrypt the private key. &lt;br&gt;
*Note:* There is no way to reset the password, so make sure you pick a password you can remember.

More details can be found at [[http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html][linuxproblem.org]].

---++ How to create an ssh key on Windows

Use [[http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe][PuTTYGen]] to create a new key pair.

Save the public and private key. Send me the public one.

The private one will have to be loaded into puTTY.
