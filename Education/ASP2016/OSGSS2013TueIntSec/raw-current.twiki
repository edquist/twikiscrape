---+ 2013 OSG User School - Introduction to security

This interactive session will provide you an overview of why we need security in the distributed computing world.

We will be doing this exercise the old fashioned way; no computers involved. We will use paper and pen, with students playing the roles of compute nodes.

Only the basic instructions are provided; most of the details will be provided by the instructor.

---+++ Exercise in a nutshell

We will have 3 types of nodes:
   * 8 user nodes
   * a scheduler node
   * 20 compute nodes

Two students will act as networking.

Students should pick their preferred role... but the instructor will have the final word.

Users create jobs to run.  They are given a stack of paper
that contain a set of blank fields to complete: 
   * user name (fictitious, assigned), 
   * job (&lt;b&gt;simple&lt;/b&gt; math problem, easy to compute, e.g. 7+8), 
   * other fields to leave blank (job ID, compute slot, result). 

Once filled out each paper, the User gives the paper to the scheduler and
waits for the results.

The Scheduler Node obtains the jobs from Users and adds unique job IDs to the sheet of paper.
Periodically, it looks for available Compute nodes and passes jobs to them, in random order (e.g. pick from a bowl).
It also collects the results and hands them back to the users.

A Compute node accepts the job request, copies down the existing data to a new piece of paper,
add its name to the paper, computes the result, writes it down and return it to the scheduler node.
