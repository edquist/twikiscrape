---+++ Overview of Minimal System for Training Session
The ideal minimal preparation for benefitting from the Tier-3 training session
is two PC&#39;s installed with SL4, and no Firewalls. You then install a batch system
that allows you to use PC 1 to submit a job to PC 2. In addition, you export
the filesystem of PC 1 to PC 2.

A minimal system like this will allow you to participate in all the exercises at the
Tier-3 training session.
