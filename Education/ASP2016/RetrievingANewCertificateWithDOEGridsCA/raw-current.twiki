In [[RequestingANewCertificateWithDOEGridsCA][an earlier section]], you should have requested a certificate from yourself from the DOEgrids CA. Hopefully by now that request has been processed and you should have an approval message in your email inbox.

That email message will contain a serial number. For example, in the below message, the serial number is 0x3cc4.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Your Personal certificate request has been processed successfully.              
SubjectDN= CN=Ben Clifford 800313,OU=People,DC=doegrids,DC=org

Serial Number= 0x1234                                                           
&lt;/pre&gt;

Retrieve your credential like this:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;userinput&gt;cert-retrieve -prefix YourName -label YourName -certnum 0x1234&lt;/userinput&gt;
 using CA doegrids
Checking that the usercert and /home/train99/.globus/YourNamekey.pem match
Enter pass phrase for /home/train99/.globus/YourNamekey.pem:
writing RSA key
/home/train99/.globus/YourNamecert.pem and /home/train99/.globus/YourNamekey.pem now contain your Globus credential
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you have an OSG credential for yourself.

Each person in your team should repeat the above retrieve command, making sure to change the -certnum, -prefix and -label options. Be very careful to change all of these so that you do not overwrite your teammembers credentials.


Now we will create a proxy using this new credential:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;userinput&gt;grid-proxy-init -cert .globus/YourNamecert.pem -key .globus/YourNamekey.pem -out YourNameProxy -verify&lt;/userinput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
