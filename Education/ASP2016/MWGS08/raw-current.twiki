__Do you have a project that takes too long when running on a single processor ?__

__Do you deal with large amounts of data from simulations or experiments ?__

[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] (OSG), the [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]]  and the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] present a three day intensive course in grid computing and its application to scientific discovery. 

The course introduces the techniques of grid and distributed       
computing for science and engineering fields, with hands-on training in the     
use of national grid computing resources. The workshop introduces essential     
skills that will be needed by researchers in the natural and applied            
sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support              
large-scale computation and data analysis in emerging grid and distributed      
computing environments.  

School participants will work with grid computing experts during the 3-day training. The workshop will focus on enabling the use of the national     
cyberinfrastructure -[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] and [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]]- to perform             
%RED% large-scale computations %ENDCOLOR% and %RED% data-intensive processing %ENDCOLOR% in the your field of     
research. Participants will learn to use grids of thousands of processors       
and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after    
the class. We encourage you to bring your research project to us for suggestions and help in porting your application to the grid. We would like to offer you support in transitioning your application to this platform.

#HowToApply

---+++ Cost

The workshop will be free to students and there will be a $100 registration fee for all other categories of participants.  

Full-time students from outside the Chicago/Illinois area who seek travel and expense support should indicate this need in their application. A limited amount of such support may be available for transportation and lodging. We expect that most non-student participants will be from the neighboring states and/or have other means of support for the duration of the workshop.

---+++ Location

The workshop will be held Wed-Fri, September 17-19 at the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]].
We will meet in Room RI - 480 of the Research Institute (RI) building situated on the the corner of 57th St and Ellis Ave in Hyde Park (see [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=57th+st+and+ellis+ave+chicago&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=41.95363,81.914062&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.791393,-87.60129&amp;spn=0.009679,0.019999&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr][map]]).


---+++ Transportation and Directions
Please consult the [[http://www.uchicago.edu/about/visiting.shtml][University Travel pages]] for more information. 

---+++ Accomodation

We do not have a particular block of rooms set apart for this event, but we recommend the following [[http://www.uchicago.edu/about/accommodations.shtml][hotels in downtown Chicago]]. In particular, Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites by Marriott and Doubletree(Magnificent Mile) offer very good location and rates. (please ask for the discounted UChicago rate when calling). For students, or people interested in staying closer to the University campus and the location of the event, we suggest the [[http://ihouse.uchicago.edu/][International House]]. Note: downtown is about 10 miles from the campus and you&#39;ll need to arrange transportation to and from the event. (a cab ride is $20, a bus ride is $2 or you could rent a car and park in the nearby garage at 55th &amp; Ellis Ave for $20/day or free in the street, if you come early and you&#39;re lucky to find a spot).

---+++ Sponsors
The workshop is supported by [[http://opensciencegrid.org][Open Science Grid]], through the support of the [[http://www.er.doe.gov/][Department of Energy Office of Science]] and the [[http://nsf.gov][National Science Foundation]].
