This intensive workshop introduces the techniques of grid and distributed       
computing for science and engineering fields, with hands-on training in the     
use of national grid computing resources. The workshop introduces essential     
skills that will be needed by researchers in the natural and applied            
sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support              
large-scale computation and data analysis in emerging grid and distributed      
computing environments.  

Workshop participants will work with some of the world&#39;s leading experts in     
grid computing. The workshop will focus on enabling the use of the national     
cyberinfrastructure - *Open Science Grid* and *Tera Grid* - to perform             
large-scale computations and data-intensive processing in the your field of     
research. Participants will learn to use grids of thousands of processors       
and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after    
the workshop.              

The workshop will cover:

  &lt;li&gt; Overview of distributed computing concepts and tools                         
  &lt;li&gt; Wide-area high speed optical networking                                      
  &lt;li&gt; Concepts, tools, and techniques of grid computing                            
  &lt;li&gt; Discovering and using grid resources                                         
  &lt;li&gt; Grid scheduling and distributed data management                              
  &lt;li&gt; Web service and grid service concepts                                        
  &lt;li&gt; Techniques for workflow and collaboration  
&lt;/ul&gt;

Undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, educators and                 
professionals in engineering, computer science, or any scientific, data- or     
computing-intensive discipline may apply.                                       
                                                                                
Applicants should have at least intermediate programming skills (one to two     
semesters experience in C/C++, Java, Perl, and/or Python) and hands-on          
experience with UNIX / Linux in a networked environment.
