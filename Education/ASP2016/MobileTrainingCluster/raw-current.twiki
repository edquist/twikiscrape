OSG Mobile Training Cluster

This cluster is undergoing setup at the moment. Hopefully it will be a stable installation.

At present, the Keeper of the Cluster is Ben Clifford, benc@ci.uchicago.edu

There are four machines, labelled 1..4. Their hostnames necessarily change as the cluster moves to different locations.

at present, the machines live at workshop1..4.ci.uchicago.edu

workshop1 is the most installed machine.
