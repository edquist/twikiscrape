(any other content we need to replicate?  --> backup CDs with Ubuntu 7.04
<p />
SLides on mem sticks?) 
<p />
logitech cursor for talks... (buy 3)

1) For example, this command will test the number 143 for primality.
   $ primetest 122
<p />
Inconsistency.
<p />
2) <a href="mailto&#58;train27&#64;workshop2">train27&#64;workshop2</a>:~$ globus-job-run tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org   /sw/national_grids/primetest 143
GRAM Job failed because the executable does not exist (error code 5)
<p />
What is the answer ? Better yet, where can one get the answer ?
<p />
3) Log Into workshop2.ci.uchicago.edu
<p />
   First, log into workshop2.ci.uchicago.edu
<p />
   &gt;&gt; remove one
<p />
4) I couldn't run the part on workshop4 because the pass I have for train27 on workshop2 does not match the one on workshop4. Shouldn't they be the same ?
<p />
5) Where do we need to do the Simple DAG exercise ? workshop2 or 4 ? in which directory ? condor-tutorial/submit ?
<p />
   ./watch_condor_q is not found (neither in the home directory nor in the submit subdir)
<p />
6) In the section following "Change watch_condor_q to use this:"
<p />
   you have included train99 in the source, but then it doesn't appear when you 'cat' it. Also, maybe should be mentioned to substitute it with their own id.
<p />
7) <a href="mailto&#58;train27&#64;workshop2">train27&#64;workshop2</a>:~/dataex$ globus-job-run tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org /bin/mkdir /home/etrain27/data <dl>
<dt> /bin/mkdir</dt><dd> cannot create directory `/home/etrain27/data': File exists
</dd></dl> 
<p />
   maybe these dierctories were not erased since last workshop
<p />
8) "here are various other sites that you could use - the instructors can tell you."  --> let's not forget to have a list of working sites handy (or posted)
<p />
9) "gsiftp://tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org/scratch/train99/ - a directory accessible via gsiftp on the host called tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org in directory /scratch/train99."
     a directory .... in  a directory ! -->  rephrase
<p />
10) "Now that you're tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org" --> missing 'in' or 'on' ?
<p />
11) What is the lesson we learn from using parallel streams for data transfer ? why should we use this technique ?
<p />
12) <a href="mailto&#58;train27&#64;workshop2">train27&#64;workshop2</a>:~/dataex$ cat /sw/misc/example.rft

gsiftp://workshop1.gpn.net:2811/etc/group
gsiftp://workshop1.gpn.net:2811/home/train99/copy-of-group
<p />
Probably should change the workshop1 references to workshop2 ... why port 2811 ?
<p />
"This example lists three transfers: largefile will be transfered three times, once each to workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu, once to tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org, and once to another host on the grid." -- &gt;  I don't see it ...
<p />
13) File missing:
<a href="mailto&#58;rain27&#64;workshop2">rain27&#64;workshop2</a>:~/dataex$ globus-rls-cli rls://workshop2.ci.uchicago.edu
rls&gt; query lrc lfn example
globus_rls_client: LFN doesn't exist: example
<p />
14)  "Now copy largefile to another place (on another gridlab machine or on one of the remote sites)"  --> gridlab reference ? better to specify a concrete remote site
<p />
15)
<a href="mailto&#58;train27&#64;workshop2">train27&#64;workshop2</a>:~/dataex$ globus-rls-cli rls://workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu

Could not send Query(connection dead)
<p />
16)  The treasure hunt .... are the treasures hunt-able ? I don't think they're in the system.
<p />
17) "Note
<p />
The identity of the certificate that you have just acquired earlier in this exercise is not in the gridmap file."  --> what does this note mean ?
<p />
18) "Use <span class="twikiNewLink">GridCat<a href="/bin/edit/Education/ASP2016/GridCat?topicparent=Education/ASP2016.TodoList" rel="nofollow" title="GridCat (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> to find the APP variables."  --> <span class="twikiNewLink">GridCat<a href="/bin/edit/Education/ASP2016/GridCat?topicparent=Education/ASP2016.TodoList" rel="nofollow" title="GridCat (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> ?
<p />
19) prime.c is not there
<p />
<p />
I guess that's all from me for now.
<p />
I wanted to ask as well what the lab content will be for Tue 1.5 session -- this would obviously be too much. Shall we just do it in a demo fashion ? 
<p />

<p />
From Oct 9 email:
<p />
?) don't understand when we compute the time Fork vs Condor ? what are the 2 cases ? there is only one (that I see) test case
<p />
?) running under a remote shell (in intro)-- why is this important ?
<p />
?) How do I change the font color in docBook ?
Give complete syntax of commands -- for example globus-url-copy : parameters ... or mention that we can use -help option to get full syntax
<p />
*) In "Optional: Multiple Globus Schedulers" section
<p />
incorrect site names: evitable.uchicago.edu --> evitable.ci.uchicago.edu (but it's down anyways)
terminable.uchicago.edu --> terminable.ci.uchicago.edu
or workshop3.ci.uchicago.edu/jobmanager-condor &lt;-- is this a site ?
*) Transfers to a remote site SECTION in Data management
<p />
"the instructors can tell you" --> we should prepare a list here for alternative sites (and account names ?)
<p />
?) Are accounts on tp-login.ci.uchicago.edu/home/etrain99 called <span class="twikiNewLink">TeraGrid<a href="/bin/edit/Education/ASP2016/TeraGrid?topicparent=Education/ASP2016.TodoList" rel="nofollow" title="TeraGrid (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> accounts ? Why ?
<p />
*) My proxy on train22 has expired. I could not accessed the etrain22 account. (and from <a href="mailto&#58;abejan&#64;gridlab1">abejan&#64;gridlab1</a> I can't access tp-login, right ? since I don't have an account there) We have to keep that in mind when we create accounts for self-paced on gridlab machines as well
<p />
*) Under the RFT section there are several things that need to be changed:
$cp /sw/misc/example.rft rft.xfr
<p />
works in workshop4, but does not exist on gridlab1
<p />
the content of rft.xfr needs adjusted, specifically:
 gsiftp://workshop1.gpn.net:2811/etc/group
 gsiftp://workshop1.gpn.net:2811/home/train99/copy-of-group
<p />
Also this command:
$ rft -h workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu -f ./rft.xfr
<p />
*) In the paragraph: "The transfer file has a number of options, documented in-line. You can experiment changing them. Interesting ones to try:"
<p />
Add more URLs to transfer --> we should give examples (that would work)
Transfer between two remote sites --> give examples (same)
Use parallel streams --> give examples (same)
Increase the transfer concurrency --> give examples (same)
<p />
Also, put an 'example' file somewhere (gridlab2.ci.uchicago.edu/scratch/example probably, and not only) that they can find using queries like  $ globus-rls-cli rls://gridlab1.ci.uchicago.edu
Modify the connection to logical filename 'another-example' correspondingly.
<p />
<p />
?)  <a href="mailto&#58;abejan&#64;gridlab1">abejan&#64;gridlab1</a> ~]$ create abejan-first-lfn gsiftp://gridlab1.ci.uchicago.edu/home/bejan/dataex/largefile-abejan
-bash: create: command not found
<p />
Why doesn't it find 'create' ? Also:
[abejan@gridlab1 ~]$ query
-bash: query: command not found
[abejan@gridlab1 ~]$ add
-bash: add: command not found
<p />
So I couldn't run those exercises.
<p />
*) "Get a neighbour to query the RLS for your logical filename, and see that the mappings you have made are public for everyone to see." --> can we "simulate" the neighbor ?
<p />
*) "You should see that there are some other locations from which you can get the example file." -->&gt; provide the answer; which are these locations ? At the moment gridlab2 is not setup, but it should work soon, therefore the one below does  not work:
<p />
[abejan@gridlab1 ~]$  globus-rls-admin -p rls://gridlab2.ci.uchicago.edu
<p />
connect(rls://gridlab2.ci.uchicago.edu): globus_rls_client: Globus I/O error: globus_xio_gsi: gss_init_sec_context failed.
globus_gsi_gssapi: Unable to verify remote side's credentials
globus_gsi_gssapi: Unable to verify remote side's credentials: Couldn't verify the remote certificate
<span class="twikiNewLink">OpenSSL<a href="/bin/edit/Education/ASP2016/OpenSSL?topicparent=Education/ASP2016.TodoList" rel="nofollow" title="OpenSSL (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> Error: s3_pkt.c:1052: in library: SSL routines, function SSL3_READ_BYTES: sslv3 alert bad certificate SSL alert number 42
<p />
?) [abejan@gridlab1 ~]$ globus-rls-admin -S rls://workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu
<p />
connect(rls://workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu): globus_rls_client: Globus I/O error: globus_xio_gsi: gss_init_sec_context failed.
<span class="twikiNewLink">OpenSSL<a href="/bin/edit/Education/ASP2016/OpenSSL?topicparent=Education/ASP2016.TodoList" rel="nofollow" title="OpenSSL (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> Error: s3_clnt.c:842: in library: SSL routines, function SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: certificate verify failed
globus_gsi_callback_module: Could not verify credential
globus_gsi_callback_module: Could not verify credential: self signed certificate in certificate chain
<p />
Should it work for 'workshop4' ? It does work for gridlab1.ci, so I think that's what we need.
<p />
*) Of course, the "Treasure Hunt" has to be properly set up and a solution has to be provided. (is there more than 1 solution ?)
<p />
*) as text editors I can specify 'nano, joe' for instance
<p />
*) in globus-url-copy gsiftp://localhost:2811/home/YOURLOGIN/tempFile      gsiftp://localhost:2811/home/YOURLOGIN/destFile
 what is the meaning of port 2811 ?
<p />
*) grid-cert-info works well without the -file parameter. Why do we need -file ?
<p />
I don't understand:  "The contents are similar to your user certificate, but there are some differences; for example, the issuer is the DN of the user certificate, rather than of the certificate authority."
Where do I see the difference ? Why is it important ?
<p />

<p />
 Isn't it too much info for people to see ? (gridlab1 has all this) I.e., can this info be misused ?
<p />
*) "To get grid access to gridlab2 with your new credential, you have to do something similar there."  -- you said that this step would not be necessary. What is the correct statement then ? (they will share the gridmap, right ?) In that case, we must reconsider the goal of the exercise.
<p />
?) I don't understand: "The proxy lifetime cannot be greater than the certificate that issues it - you cannot make a proxy that lasts beyond the expiry date of your usercert." -- can you explain in more detail?
<p />
*) in the exercise with DOE certs to transfer files, there is the following explanation:
<p />
"The above error indicates that the authentication failed because the credential that you have just acquired is not trusted on workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu. The proxy is valid, but it is not trusted on that specific machine."
<p />
But, the proxy has just expired (previous exercise). Shouldn't we make a  note to regenerate the proxy ?
<p />
*) "This cluster has been set up to trust the DOEGrids CA. In this example workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu is local machine and workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu is remote machine."
<p />
2 points here:
  - we have not used "cluster" before -- is this the right moment/term?
People are confused by "cluster".
  - workshop4 will be substituted by gridlab1 -- in both occurences? (we transfer locally, on the same machine ? -- can we avoid the full domain name and use localhost instead ? I might be missing the goal of this exercise.)
<p />
*) "Now that the gridmap file has been updated such that your identity is authorized to submit jobs, lets try the command again." -- did something  happen in between these 2 exercises that made this happen ? I didn't catch it.
<p />
*) [YOURLOGIN@workshop4 ~]$ ssh workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu
 [YOURLOGIN@gridlab2 ~]$ ls -lt /tmp/YOURLOGINTest
-rw-r--r--  1 YOURLOGIN YOURLOGIN 43 Jun 23 12:07 /tmp/YOURLOGINTest
[YOURLOGIN@gridlab2 ~]$
 There is some inconsistency here -- does it have to do with ENTITY (which will be changed soon) ? Or it is a typo.
Shouldn't it be ssh to gridlab2 ?
<p />
*) /sw/national_grids/prime.c has to be moved to gridlab1 machine (this worked for workshop4) and make sure it has the permissions right. I.e:
<p />
   <a href="mailto&#58;train22&#64;workshop4">train22&#64;workshop4</a>:~$ cp /sw/national_grids/prime.c . <dl>
<dt> cp</dt><dd> cannot open `/sw/national_grids/prime.c' for reading: Permission denied
</dd></dl> 
<p />
*) any specific reason we always need ./some_command instead of simply some_command ?
*) [YOURLOGIN@workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu ~]$ globusrun -a -r tp-login.ci.uchicago.edu/jobmanager-fork
GRAM Authentication test successful

Maybe make a note that this only tells you you can run Gram2 and not Gram4. The latter is by trial &amp; error.
Are there any other mechanisms to find resources?

?) I have scheduled the following job that uses different submission sites :
<p />
[abejan@gridlab1 submit]$ condor_submit -a "arguments = 1000 2 500" -a "output = output/1.out" -a "grid_resource = gt2 red.unl.edu/jobmanager" -a "executable = /opt/osg/app/abejan/prime" -a "arguments = 1000 551 1000" -a "output = output/2.out" -a "grid_resource = gt2 grid3.aset.psu.edu/jobmanager" -a "executable = /usr1/grid3/app/abejan/prime" example.sub

Why does it appear as only 1 job ? Shouldn't it be 2 jobs ? I got 2 answers though (both NO).
<p />
*) Download the dprime.tar.gz that contins the ./script.pl --> the intermediate steps to actually save it in the Unix account - such as FTP and un-tar - are missing and they should be useful.
<p />
*) pacman not installed on gridlab1--> do we want it ? Instead, maybe place instructions on how to download and untar pacman.
<p />
$cd [some_dir]
$wget <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pcman-3.19.tar.gz" target="_top">http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pcman-3.19.tar.gz</a>
$ tar -xzvf pacman-3.19.tar.gz
$ cd pacman-3.19
<p />
Is there anything else missing ?
<p />
*) do we want them to install VDT in these accounts ? Probably not.
<p />
*) your dprime.tar.gz package contains almost what we are trying to create by packging the prime numbers application, correct ? Since the dprime.tar.gz package untars into the 'dprime' directory, it might be confusing (also prone to overiding) when creating the application package from scratch. Would you like to give that 'dprime' directory a different name ? I am referring to this step:
[YOURLOGIN@workshop4.ci.uchicago.edu ~] mkdir dprime
<p />
Put a small Readme file on how to use the ./script.pl (even though it's quite self-explanatory). For example: does the choice order count ?
<p />
*) the Extra credit problem should have a solution -- and possibly additional to-do exercises (with hints/solutions/partial solutions etc).
