---++ General Information About the School Schedule

---+++ Travel Schedule

For planning your trip:

   * *Arrive on Sunday, June 23, 2013,* prior to 5 p.m. (if possible). Although classes begin on Monday morning, there is a welcome dinner on Sunday evening for students and instructors. This is a nice way to get to know each other and start the week.

   * *Depart on Friday, June 28, 2013,* any time. The School finishes with another dinner on Thursday evening, so it is best to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the five nights of this schedule.

---+++ School Hours

The school is 8:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday. A detailed schedule will be available before the School begins.
