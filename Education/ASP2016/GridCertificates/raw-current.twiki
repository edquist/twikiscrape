---+++ Personal Grid Certificates
Admins are encouraged to obtain a personal Grid Certificate. Please consult your VO for instructions on how to get one. USCMS sites can consult the USCMS website at http://www.uscms.org. Specifically the page with instructions on how to get a certificate is [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/GettingStarted/index.html][here]]. The USATLAS website is http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/. The wiki page with their specific instructions is [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/Support/HowToGridCertificate.html][here]]. *Please note* that getting a certificate will take a couple of days or more depending on the availability of your local contact and his or her ability to confirm that you are who you say you are to a DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA). Remember that a certificate is the first step in getting access to large amounts of resources so this step is important and essential to maintaining security across the Grid. 

---+++ Host and Service Certificates
All OSG sites, and in general just about any grid service requires its own certificate. For the Computing Element (CE) a host certificate will be required. You may obtain one by going to https://pki1.doegrids.org/, clicking on the &quot;Grid or SSL Server&quot; link and filling out the form. Use OSG as your affiliation and select your appropriate VO. If you are going to be requesting several host and or service certificates you may want to enroll as a Grid Admin. The Grid Admin interface allows you to use your personal certificate to generate host and service certificates on the fly. This is a great convenience if you generate more than one or two certifcates for your site. Instructions on how to request to be a Grid Admin are available from the OSG Operations page [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/OSGRA/][here]].
