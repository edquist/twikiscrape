---++ Why it is safe to continue the application process 


Any server certificate has to be signed by a certifying authority (CA) in order for it to function as a security mechanism when communicating with a client.  Web browsers come pre-loaded with a group of CAs that are recognized as trustworthy by the Internet at-large.  When an organization uses one of those pre-loaded CAs to sign its certificate, it can assume the web browser will implicitly trust the server certificate and won&#39;t trouble the user with the details.

Unfortunately, an organization must provide the recognized CA with paperwork documenting the organization&#39;s validity, and this almost always costs money as well.  This is not unlike a notary public&#39;s role in certifying a copy of a birth certificate when an individual applies for a passport, but if the encrypted web content is financial data from a multi-billion dollar bank, the stakes are much greater.  Encrypting sensitive data via the Internet is always good practice, but more modest organizations (such as the CI) will forego with the costs and bureaucracy of the yearly practice of having their server certificate signed by a universally-recognized CA.  Instead, the organization may opt to simply sign the certificate itself (again, like the CI).  The browser is simply telling the user &quot;I don&#39;t recognize the organization that signed this server&#39;s certificate, so be cautious, and don&#39;t proceed unless you feel safe doing so.&quot;

In short, the CI&#39;s self-signed server certificate is legitimate, and we kindly ask the users to trust us on that. :)
