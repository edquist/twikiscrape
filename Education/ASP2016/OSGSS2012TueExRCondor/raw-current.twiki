---+ Tue Morning Exercise - Using glideinWMS without a dedicated node

---++ Introduction
You have probably noticed that we use a different node for the glideinWMS exercises.&lt;br&gt;
This is because glideinWMS is quite a heavyweight solution; it requires properly configured Condor daemons to be running in order to work.

In this exercise, you will learn how to use a glideinWMS system without explicitly logging into a glideinWMS submit node.

---++ Remote Condor

[[https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=RemoteCondor][Remote Condor (or RCondor)]] is a small, optional package that is distributed with Condor.
Its main function is to allow a user to use a remote Condor installation over ssh, while preserving a local look-and-feel. 

See Jeff Dost&#39;s presentation 
([[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2012/presentations/dost-rcondor.odp][OpenDocument]] , [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2012/presentations/dost-rcondor.pdf][PDF]]) from [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2012/tuesday.html][this year&#39;s Condor week]].

---++ Trying Remote Condor

You can try out Remote Condor on any !RedHat Linux compatible node that has sshfs installed. Follow the instructions in
Jeff&#39;s presentation 
([[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2012/presentations/dost-rcondor.odp][OpenDocument]] , [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2012/presentations/dost-rcondor.pdf][PDF]]).

Point Remote Condor to osg-ss-glidein.chtc.wisc.edu.

%TWISTY{
mode=&quot;div&quot;
showlink=&quot;Advanced&quot;
hidelink=&quot;Hide advanced&quot;
showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
}%
You will notice that you have to type you password a lot.

Try enabling [[http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/530][ssh key authentication]] (possibly without a password).
%ENDTWISTY%
&lt;br&gt;

*Warning:* If you decide to try it out on osg-ss-submit, please be aware that this will hide the &quot;normal&quot; Condor from you. To revert, simply comment the relevant lines from .bashrc.
