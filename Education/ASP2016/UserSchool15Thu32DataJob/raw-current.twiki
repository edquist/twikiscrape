---+ !!Transferring data via HTTP plugin
%TOC%

The goal of this exercise is to use the HTTP protocol to download data from remote web servers. This exercise builds off of the NAMD example from [[UserSchool15Thu12DataJob][Exercise 2.1]], but uses a new method to retrieve the job data.

Finally, we&#39;ll write a job that uses OSG&#39;s HTTP caches.

---++ Background

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a &quot;public cloud infrastructure&quot;, which is a collection of paid computing services. For this tutorial, we have uploaded the NAMD files to the Amazon&#39;s Simple Storage Service (S3) for you. Your task will be to write a job to download the input files from _the cloud_ and run NAMD.

&lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/data_tranfer_aws.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;data_tranfer_aws.jpg&quot; width=&#39;400&#39; height=&#39;300&#39;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---++ Setup
First, we&#39;ll need our NAMD script from previous exercise. Go ahead and copy the =namd_run.sh= script from [[UserSchool15Thu12DataJob][Exercise 2.1]]. 

Next, we&#39;ll want to create a submit file and transfer the input data from AWS. 

The input files you need for this exercise are located here:
| http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/osg-user-school/namd/par_all27_prot_lipid.inp |
| http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/osg-user-school/namd/ubq_gbis_eq.conf |
| http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/osg-user-school/namd/ubq.pdb |
| http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/osg-user-school/namd/ubq.psf |

As in the previous exercise, we need to tell HTCondor where to find the input files. HTCondor makes this very simple to do: just create a comma-separated list of HTTP links after =transfer_input_files=.

You can get started using the template below:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
universe = vanilla
executable = namd_run.sh
transfer_input_files = 
output =
error = 
log = 
should_transfer_files=Yes
requirements = (HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= TRUE)
queue
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember that the =requirements= line is needed to tell HTCondor to only match against job slots that have the OASIS software library available. Don&#39;t forget to specify the =output=, =error=, and =log=!


To load the NAMD program, we use the OSG Distributed Environment Modules. For more information about OASIS, you may refer [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634394-accessing-software-using-distributed-environment-modules][here]]. 

Our wrapper script for NAMD is:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash
echo &quot;Files in the current directory:&quot; $(ls)
source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/current/init/bash
module load namd/2.9
namd2 ubq_gbis_eq.conf &gt; ubq_gbis_eq.log
&lt;/pre&gt; 

Save the wrapper as =namd_run.sh= and remember to make it executable with =chmod +x namd_run.sh=.

Once done, submit the job. 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_submit namd_run.submit
&lt;/pre&gt;

Again, the job should run 5 minutes or so. If the job was successful, you should see a bunch of output files in the directory you submitted from. You can verify that the input files were downloaded by looking at the =output= file you created in your job. To dot his, just =grep= for the output as before:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% grep &quot;Files in the current directory&quot; job.out
Files in the current directory: _condor_stderr _condor_stdout condor_exec.exe par_all27_prot_lipid.inp ubq.pdb ubq.psf ubq_gbis_eq.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Transfer data from Stash

Every user on OSG Connect has a publicly accessible directory served by the =stash.osgconnect.net= web server. In your home directory, you should find a subdirectory named =public=. Files that live in =~/public= are accessible at http://stash.osgconnect.net/+username/ where =username= is your OSG Connect username.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/data_tranfer_stash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;data_tranfer_stash.jpg&quot; width=&#39;400&#39; height=&#39;300&#39;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

As before, copy the NAMD files to your =~/public= directory.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% cp -a /stash/public/userschool2015/namd ~/public
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will also need the =namd_run.sh= script from the previous exercise. You can either copy it or create it again. Here&#39;s the script again:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash
echo &quot;Files in the current directory:&quot; $(ls)
source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/current/init/bash
module load namd/2.9
namd2 ubq_gbis_eq.conf &gt; ubq_gbis_eq.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

This time, try creating the entire submit file by yourself. Remember that you will need to include: 
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
requirements = (HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= TRUE)
&lt;/pre&gt; 

*HINT* Here&#39;s what one of the =transfer_input_files= paths should look like: http://stash.osgconnect.net/+lincolnb/namd/ubq.pdb

Did the transfer work? Check your =output= file for the presence of the NAMD input files.
