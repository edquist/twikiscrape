---+ Example 3.2 Perform blast search for a different query file

   * The scripts and the workflow developed for BLAST search in the previous example is not limited to HLA.txt query file. 
   * It is easy to re-use the scripts with a minimal change for another query.   
   * In this exercise, change the job scripts to perform blast search on &quot;BRAC1.txt&quot;  
   * BRAC1.txt is located at /stash/public/userschool2015/BlastSplitSearch/QueryFiles/
