---+ Getting a Certificate 

---++ Introduction

We&#39;d like you to get a certificate on your own time before Tuesday morning. For now, we&#39;re asking you to walk through this process without much explanation of the background. We want you to have the certificate ready to use, and various aspects will be explained as needed throughout the school. 

Your certificate (really, your pair of public certificate and private key) are needed for security purposes. They are used to uniquely identify you when you access computing or storage resources in Open Science Grid. 

Your certificate is based on the underlying Public Key Infrastructure ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure][background from Wikipedia]]). 

---++ Getting your certificate

---+++ If you already have a certificate from DOEGrids

If you already have a certificate from DOEGrids, email the DN to Alain Roy, roy@cs.wisc.edu. 

---+++ If you don&#39;t have a certificate

_Step 1:_ Log into vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu. You should have been provided with the user name and password when you arrived at the school. Let us know if you cannot log in.

_Step 2:_ Run the following =cert-request= command, changing the text in red:
&lt;pre style=&quot;margin-left:4em&quot;&gt;
&gt; cert-request -ou p -agree \
     -name %RED% &quot;Firstname Lastname&quot;%ENDCOLOR% \
     -email %RED%your@email.address%ENDCOLOR%  \
     -phone %RED%123456789%ENDCOLOR% \
     -reason &quot;Student at OSG Summer School 2010&quot; \
     -affiliation osg \
     -vo OSGEDU \
     -sponsor_name &quot;Alain Roy&quot; -sponsor_email roy@cs.wisc.edu -sponsor_phone 6082655736  \
     -label certrequest 
&lt;/pre&gt;

_Step 3:_ You&#39;ll be prompted for a password (a.k.a PEM pass prhase). Use a good one and don&#39;t forget it. Also, look at the output. Notice that there is a serial number in it. Tell Alain what the serial number is.

You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate         
has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your         
certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
&lt;/pre&gt;

_Step 4:_ Once Alain tells you that you&#39;ve gotten a certificate, you can download it with the =cert-retrieve= script. You&#39;ll get an automated email, and it will contain a _certificate serial number_. Change the serial number (in red) to match the serial number in the email.
