---+ Tue Afternoon Interactive Session - Introduction to security

---++ Introduction

This page provides the instructions for the interactive session that will introduce you to security.

---++ Environment

We will be doing this exercise the old fashioned way; no computers involved. We will use paper and pen, with students playing the roles of compute nodes..

We will have 3 types of nodes:
   * ?? (1-2 people per group) user nodes
   * 1 scheduler node
   * 4 network
   * ?? (1-2 people per group) compute nodes

Two students will act as networking.

---++ Exercise in a nutshell

---+++ Users 
   * Create jobs to run.  They are given a stack of paper that contain a set of blank fields to complete: 
      * user name (fictitious, assigned), 
      * job (math problem, e.g. 7+8), 
      * other fields to leave blank (job ID, compute slot, result). 
   * Once filled out each paper, the User gives the paper to the scheduler. He then waits for the results.

---+++ The Scheduler Node 

   * Obtains the jobs from Users and adds unique job IDs to the sheet of paper.
   * Periodically, it looks for available Compute nodes and passes jobs to them, in random order (e.g. pick from a bowl).
   * It also collects the results and hands them back to the users.

---+++ Compute Node
 
   * Accepts the job request, copies down the existing data to a new piece of paper,
   * Add its name to the paper, computes the result, writes it down and return it to the scheduler node.

---++ What will you learn

Wait and see ;)
