You will be doing almost all the lab exercises this week on a Linux computer (&quot;host&quot;) named &quot;gridlab1&quot; (its &quot;fully qualified host name&quot; is &quot;gridlab1.phys.utb.edu&quot;).  From this machine, we will run Grid jobs and explore various Grid sites.

To access this machine, from your laptop Terminal window, we will use the &quot;secure shell&quot; utility, ssh, to do a &quot;remote login&quot; from your laptop to the gridlab1 Linux server:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
laptop$ &lt;userinput&gt;ssh train42@gridlab1.phys.utb.edu&lt;/userinput&gt;
The authenticity of host &#39;gridlab1.phys.utb.edu (206.76.233.104)&#39; can&#39;t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 36:74:78:a8:ed:6b:38:96:63:20:01:df:46:9b:59:3b.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? &lt;userinput&gt;yes&lt;/userinput&gt;
Warning: Permanently added &#39;gridblab1.phys.utb.edu,206.76.233.104&#39; (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
train42@grodlab1.phys.utb.edu&#39;s password: &lt;userinput&gt;summergrid&lt;/userinput&gt;  &lt;em&gt;# not echoed !!!&lt;/em&gt;
gridlab1$     &lt;em&gt;# Now you&#39;re talking to a shell on the gridlab1 server&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

After the first time you do this, you won&#39;t get the &quot;Are you sure.&quot; prompt. Some of you will never see this, as your computers were used for testing this material, and the &quot;yes&quot; reply was already supplied by a tester.  So it will look like:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
laptop$ &lt;userinput&gt;ssh train42@gridlab1.phys.utb.edu&lt;/userinput&gt;
Password: &lt;userinput&gt;summergrid&lt;/userinput&gt;  &lt;em&gt;# enter trainingN or NN here, same as your laptop name&lt;/em&gt;
gridlab1$
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should be able to reach lab hosts gridlab2, 3, and 4 in the same manner.

For the rest of this exercise, we will use simpler prompts: =$laptop= for commands typed directly to the shell of your laptop Terminal window, and =gridlab1$= for the gridlab1 lab server.
