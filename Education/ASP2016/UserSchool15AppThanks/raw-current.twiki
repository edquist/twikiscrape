---++ Thanks For Your Application!

But wait, you are not done yet! Please remember to get a letter of recommendation. Ask someone who knows you professionally, ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and “2015 OSG User School” in the subject line and letter (PDF or plain text letters are best). If your recommender needs more information about the School, [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/UserSchool]] is the best source. All letters should be emailed to: [[mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org user-school@opensciencegrid.org]].

We expect to process applications and notify applicants by mid-May, 2015.
