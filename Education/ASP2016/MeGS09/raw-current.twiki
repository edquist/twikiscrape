__Do you have a project that takes too long when running on a single processor ?__  &lt;br&gt;
__Do you deal with large amounts of data from simulations or experiments ?__  &lt;br&gt;
__Would you like to learn about opportunistic usage and storage ?__

__This course might have the answers you need.__

[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] (OSG), the [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]]  and the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] present a three day intensive course in grid computing and its applications to scientific discovery. 

The course introduces the techniques of grid and distributed       
computing for science and engineering fields, with hands-on training in the     
use of national grid computing resources. The workshop introduces essential     
skills that will be needed by researchers in the natural and applied            
sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support              
large-scale computation and data analysis in emerging grid and distributed      
computing environments.  

School participants will work with grid computing experts during the 3-day training. The workshop will focus on enabling the use of the national     
cyberinfrastructure -[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] and [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]]- to perform             
%RED% large-scale computations %ENDCOLOR% and %RED% data-intensive processing %ENDCOLOR% in your research field. Participants will learn to use grids of thousands of processors  and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after    
the class. We encourage you to bring your research project to us for suggestions and help in porting your application to the grid. We would like to offer you support in transitioning your application to this platform.

---+++ Cost

The workshop will be FREE to all categories of participants.  

Full-time students and qualified individuals from outside the Albuquerque area who seek travel and expense support should indicate their need in the application. A limited amount of such support may be available for transportation and lodging. We expect that most non-student participants will be from the neighboring states and/or have other means of support for the duration of the workshop.

---+++ Location

The workshop will be held Wed-Fri, April 8-10 at the [[http://www.hpc.unm.edu/info/visitor-information][Center for High Performance Computer (CHPC)]] of [[http://www.unm.edu][University of New Mexico]].
We will meet in the [[http://artslab.unm.edu/facilities.html][Arts Lab]]&#39;s &quot;Black Box&quot; Space ( see [[http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=1601+Central+Ave+Ne,+Albuquerque,+NM+87106][map]]).


---+++ Transportation and Directions

The closest airport is [[http://www.cabq.gov/airport/][Albuquerque International Sunport]] in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico][Albuquerque]], the capital of New Mexico. For details on the [[http://www.unm.edu/campusmap/campusmap.pdf][campus]] and the CHPC (workshop location) please see the [[http://www.hpc.unm.edu/info/visitor-information][visitor&#39;s information pages]]. 

---++++ Parking

The CHPC has a parking lot located on the NW corner of Ash St. and Central Ave. which is just west of the CHPC building.  The participants can park anywhere except for the spaces with the green parking bumpers.  After they park, they need to come to the CHPC front desk to get a parking permit from either Erica or Julie which they can put on the driver side of their dash boards
 
They should not park on Pine St. or in the UNM Parking Services parking lot.  UNM Parking is very strict and they will get a ticket. 
 
 
---+++ Accommodation

The [[http://www.unm.edu/campusmap/campusmap.pdf][campus]] is situated in the proximity of the airport and therefore many lodging options are available at reasonable rates. We have chosen the [[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/abqfa-fairfield-inn-albuquerque-airport/][Fairfield Inn Airport]]  (standard rate is $80/night for 1 king or 2 doubles) as the designated hotel for the workshop participants. 
 

---+++ Sponsors
The workshop is supported by the [[http://opensciencegrid.org][Open Science Grid]], a national project funded by the [[http://www.er.doe.gov/][Department of Energy Office of Science]] and the [[http://nsf.gov][National Science Foundation]].
