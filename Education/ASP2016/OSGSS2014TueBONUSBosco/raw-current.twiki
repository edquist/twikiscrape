---+ BONUS: Connecting to OSG with Bosco

For this exercise, you will submit jobs to a queue on your laptop to have them run on the HTCondor cluster or OSG glidein server. Bosco is software that is specifically designed to allow this capability.

---++Pair Up!
Given that Bosco was created for unix-based operating systems (Linux or Mac), try to pair up such that a student with a non-unix laptop can still see Bosco at work on another student&#39;s Mac or Linux laptop.

---++1. Submit jobs to the School condor pool or to OSG from your laptop
Visit the Bosco homepage (http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/) to learn more about Bosco, and follow the &quot;QuickStart&quot; guide to submit jobs. You&#39;ll need to use the hostname of the School submit node or glidein server.

---++2. Submit jobs through OSG Connect from your laptop
Visit the following page in the OSG ConnectBook on using Bosco with OSG Connect: https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10944561

---++3. Explore!
Try any of the following, according to guides on the Bosco website and in the OSG ConnectBook:

-Submit jobs from your laptop to multiple other submit points (School submit node, School glidein server, OSG Connect server, your own cluster): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/BoscoInstall#7_Multi_Cluster_Bosco
