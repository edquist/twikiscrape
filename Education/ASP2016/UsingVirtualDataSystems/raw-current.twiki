%TOC%


---++ Basic usage
The exercises in this chapter will familiarize you with basic use of the VDS and with the physics example code that we will be using in later exercises.

Files used:

   * =/opt/QuarkCode= - contains simple physics application in PERL
   * =/opt/QuarkCode/sites.xml= - the site catalog
   * =/opt/QuarkCode/tc.data= - the transformation catalog
   * =BIGGERVDL PROBINTRO SIMPLEVDL VDLINTRO COMPOUNDVDL= - exercises

---++ Using Pegasus
In this chapter you will be introduced to some more of the commands needed to set up a workflow. For previous exercises, these were done for you by the instructors.

All the exercises in this Chapter will be run from the =~/COMPOUNDVL/= directory. All the files that are required reside in this sub directory

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;in&quot;&gt;cd ~/COMPOUNDVDL &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
