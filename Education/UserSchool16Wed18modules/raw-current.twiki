---+ Bonus: Installing Modules to your Python Installation

Most scientific software uses at least one specialized Python _module_ with special functionality for analysis.  In this exercise, you will pre-build a Python installation that includes the =numpy= module.  This exercise should take 10-15 minutes.  

*Note: This exercise is untested!* Give it a shot, but recognize that some things may not work exactly.  

---++ Build Job

As in [[UserSchool16Wed15pybuilt][Exercise 1.5]], we are going to submit an interactive job for building our installation.  You can choose to either add the module to your existing installation or start over from scratch.

   1. Log into =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= and go into the directory you created for the previous Python exercises.  
   2. Find the =build.submit= file you used in [[UserSchool16Wed15pybuilt][Exercise 1.5]].  If you want to add the modules to your existing installation, list your pre-built Python \
file in =transfer_input_files=.  If you want to start over from scratch, leave the Python source in =transfer_input_files=. 
   3. Submit the build submit file using the =-i= option to =condor_submit=. 
   4. Once the job starts, either untar your pre-built Python installation from before, or build one from source using the instructions from a previous exercise.  
   5. Set your =PATH= to include your installation:  \
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;export PATH=$(pwd)/python/bin:$PATH&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Adding Modules

In this example, we will be installing the =numpy= module.  There are at least two ways to install Python modules - pick one of the two options below.  

---+++ Using =setup.py=

One way to install a Python module is to download the source from [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi][The Python Package Index]] and install it using the standard \
=setup.py= script.  

   1. Go to the Python Package Index and search for numpy.  Once you find the page for numpy, scroll down the list of downloads to find the source =tar.gz= file.  Save the link \
location and download it into the interactive job using =wget=.  
   2. Untar the numpy source, and move into the created directory.  Try running the given standard =setup.py= script using: \
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;python3 setup.py install&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   3. It turns out we also need to install =setuptools=!  Move back in the main working directory of the job and repeat steps 1 and 2, but with the =setuptools= module.  
   4. Once =setuptools= is installed, move back into the =numpy-1.11.1= directory and try running the install command again: \
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;python3 setup.py install&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   5. If all goes well, the installation process should complete.  Congratulations!  You&#39;ve now included numpy in your installation.  

---+++ Using =pip=

=pip= is a package management tool that can be used to install and manage Python modules.  To install modules (in our case, numpy) using pip, simply run: 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;pip3 install numpy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

*Note:* If you are using your installation from before, this command will error out, because =pip= has stored the location of the directory where you originally built python.  To fix this, you just need to add =python3= before the =pip= command: 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;python3 pip3 install numpy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Using Your Installation

   1. Once you have installed your modules using either method, create a tarball of your new installation.  You just need to re-tar your =python= installation directory \
as the modules have been installed to a sub-directory inside.  *From the working directory* run: \
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;tar czf python_np.tar.gz python/&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Exit the interactive job.  Your new installation, =python_np.tar.gz= should have returned to the submit server with you.  
   1. Download a test script: \
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;strong&gt;wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool16/np_test.py&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Make a copy of a script and submit file from the previous exercises, modifying them to use your =python_np.tar.gz= file as the pre-built installation and to run the \
script you just downloaded.  
   1. Submit your job. Does it work? 

---++ Alternatively...

If you need a lot of python packages, using a distribution like [[https://www.continuum.io/downloads][Anaconda]] might be an easier way to install what you need.  The Anaconda \
download page provides an installation script and instructions.  Anaconda installs to a single directory - this is the directory that you&#39;ll want to tar/gzip and use to run your jobs.
