---+ Transportation to Brownsville

[[http://mypage.iu.edu/~tsilver/Departures.htm][Departure Times]] - Look here to coordinate a ride with someone. If your information isn&#39;t correct, or if it isn&#39;t on the spreadsheet, contact an instructor.

---++ Option 1

The Wave shuttles (the yellow ones you&#39;ve been riding to class) will take you across the harbor to Port Isabel, but do not get on the &quot;island only shuttle&quot; since you do want to leave the island. The Wave shuttle will drop you off in Port Isabel and you will need to wait for the !RioGulf Coast Express shuttle to take you to the Brownsville Airport for $2. Shuttle times for both shuttle services are available [[http://iflybrownsville.com/shuttleschedule.asp][here]]

---++ Option 2

Valley Transport Company (VTC) runs shuttles that will pick you up at the hotel and take you to your destination (the Brownsville Airport for many of you). You *MUST* make a reservation 24 hours in advance! The cost is $39. You can split the cost with a group, but you must make that clear when you make your reservation and tell them how many people will be in your group. They prefer that you pay with credit card at the time of the reservation, but the driver will accept cash. If you are choosing to use this option and you&#39;re riding with a group, one person in the party needs to pay for all riders. It sounds like the driver will charge any additional riders the $39 per person fee without an advanced reservation.

I&#39;m sure there are other options and you&#39;re welcome to research those. If you find a less expensive service please share it with the class.
