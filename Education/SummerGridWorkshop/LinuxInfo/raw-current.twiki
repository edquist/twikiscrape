---+++ Very brief guide to ssh
   * To create an ssh key: %BR% =$ &lt;userinput&gt;ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t dsa&lt;/userinput&gt;= %BR% Follow the instructions. Please use a nice, good pass phrase for encryption of your key.
   * The private key will be stored in =$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa=. It should have 0400 security or similar restrictive permissions. The public key will be stored in =$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub=.
   * The best way use your key, is to start a user agent, preferably once: %BR% =$ &lt;userinput&gt;eval `ssh-agent`&lt;/userinput&gt;=
   * This will setup an agent, which ssh and scp can contact, when they want to use one (or all) of your identities to go to any site.
   * In order to add keys to your ssh-agent, use =ssh-add= to add your default key(s). It will ask for the passphrase from [3]. Once your key is in the agent, you can use it repeatdely, and it will not ask for the passphrase again.
   * If you want to be able to use this key back on your logins at school or on any of the machines you use, copy/append all identity public key files into =$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys= of those systems.
