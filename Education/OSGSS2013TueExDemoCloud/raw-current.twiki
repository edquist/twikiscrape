---+ 2013 OSG User School - Running jobs with !CycleCloud

[[http://www.cyclecomputing.com/cyclecloud/overview][CycleCloud]] is a overlay system created by [[http://www.cyclecomputing.com/][a private company called CycleComputing]].

The main advantage it has over other overlay solutions is that it makes it extremely easy to use Amazon EC2 Cloud resources in a HTC fashion.
The main downside is that it only supports Amazon EC2 Cloud resources, and thus requires you to pay Amazon prices.

Igor will use his own !CycleCloud account to create an overlay pool shortly before this session. Detailed instructions on how to log into it will be provided live.

Once logged in, feel free to run a few test jobs. In parallel, Igor will show you how to influence the expansion and shrinking of the available resources.

In case something goes wrong, here are some demo slides ( [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/twiki/pub/Education/OSGSS2012TueDemoCloud/day2_CycleCloud.odp][ODP]] ,
 [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/twiki/pub/Education/OSGSS2012TueDemoCloud/day2_CycleCloud.pdf][PDF]] ), and Cycle is providing a very graphic
[[https://my.cyclecloud.com/static/pdf/CycleCloudTutorial.pdf][manual]] as well.

If you want to create your own !CycleCloud instance, and are willing to pay a few dollars out of your personal credit card,
go to [[https://my.cyclecloud.com/account/register/][https://my.cyclecloud.com/account/register/]] to create an account.
