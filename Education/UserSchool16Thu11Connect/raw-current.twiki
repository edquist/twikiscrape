---+ Thursday Exercise 1.1: Getting Acquainted with OSG Connect
%TOC% 

In this exercise, you&#39;ll get acquainted with the OSG Connect submit server, your online account information, and the OSG Connect helpdesk.

---++ Signing up and Logging in to OSG Connect
Hopefully you&#39;ve already signed up for OSG Connect, if not please visit this page: http://osgconnect.net/signup

Once you&#39;ve signed up, SSH to =username@login.osgconnect.net= in a command-line terminal. The username will be the string of characters at the top right of the osgconnect.net website, once you&#39;re logged in. Your password for SSH will be the same password you used to log in to the website.

---++ Get Acquainted with the OSG Connect Submit Server

---+++ Look around your &#39;home&#39; directory

You&#39;ll notice the &#39;data&#39;, &#39;public&#39;, and &#39;stash&#39; directories, which may be used in various specific OSG Connect guides. You&#39;ll use these spaces for different reasons. *Make sure to read the OSG Connect helpdesk guides* on [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000006512-guidelines-for-data-managment-in-osg-storage-and-transfer][data management]] and [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000002985-storage-solutions-on-osg-home-stash-and-public][storage solutions]].

---+++ Run =condor_q=

You will also notice that a &quot;condor_q&quot; command allows you to see everyone&#39;s jobs, by default. This is because OSG Connect is still running an older version of HTCondor, which you can also check and compare to the version on the =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= and =osg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu= servers:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% &lt;strong&gt;condor_version&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you&#39;d like to see just your own jobs in future exercises, run =condor_q username=, inserting your username, appropriately.

*Additionally*, take note that this version of HTCondor lacks the various options for using =queue= statements to indicate many jobs at once. Though, you can still use =queue &lt;#&gt;= to queue many processes, as this is an older HTCondor feature.

---+++ Run =condor_status=

Running =condor_status= by itself on OSG Connect will give no output, but you can otherwise check with:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% &lt;strong&gt;condor_status -pool osg-flock.grid.iu.edu&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Look around the OSG Connect Website

   1. Go to http://osgconnect.net and select &quot;Sign In&quot; from the &quot;Sign In/Sign Up&quot; drop-down menu at the top right.
   1. After logging in, check out your &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Group&quot; pages from the drop-down menu under your name at the top right.
   1. Also check out the links under &quot;Resources&quot;, as well as &quot;Connect&quot;&gt;&quot;My Projects&quot; (and click &quot;Allow&quot; if asked), and &quot;Account&quot;.

For some of the later exercises for OSG Connect, we&#39;ll point you to the OSG Connect helpdesk tutorials, since these have been developed specifically with OSG Connect in mind.

---++ Visit the Helpdesk Materials

From the OSG Connect main page (while logged in), select &quot;Helpdesk&quot; from the &quot;Support&quot; drop-down in the top menu bar. You&#39;ll be using some of these in the following exercises.

---+++ Move on to the next exercise when you&#39;re ready to submit jobs!
