---+!! Getting to know your Mac Laptop
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

You will be working for the week in teams of two, which have been pre-assigned and are listed on a handout titled Team List.  Please find your partner, and locate (from the handout) the laptop that you have been assigned to.

You and your partner will share the same userid on the laptop, and use the same userid to log into the Linux lab systems that we will be using.  These IDs are of the form &quot;trainingN&quot; - listed on the Class Team Roster. You&#39;ll need to work on the laptop with the same number - that&#39;s where your login has been established. These numbers are also marked on stickers on the bottom of the laptop, and on each desk in the lab.

You will be using the following tools on your laptop:

   * _Terminal_ tool to connect to the Linux lab systems.
   * _FireFox_ browser.  Since some things require !FireFox and don&#39;t work well with Safari or Internet Explorer, its best to stay in !FireFox and keep all your bookmarks in this one browser.
   * Occasionally, a simple text editor.

Please take a moment and learn how to start these tools from the !MacOS &quot;Dock&quot; - the tool selector at the bottom of the laptop. To create a new Terminal window from within Terminal, use File -&gt; New Shell.

A handy tip: you can use the Apple-Key (has an &quot;Apple&quot; and &quot;Propeller&quot; symbol - just to the left of the space bar) for fast cut and paste. Apple-C = &quot;copy the text selected by the cursor&quot;, Apple-V = &quot;paste text selected by the cursor&quot;, Apple-X = &quot;delete text selected by the cursor&quot;.


Now, start a &quot;Terminal&quot; window from the desktop Dock at the bottom of your screen (it may have been moved to the sides or even the top, though.). The icon for Terminal is a black screen with the characters &quot;&gt;_&quot; on it.

Note the conventions for command-line dialogs that will be used throughout these exercises:

What you type is in *bold*. The system&#39;s responses are in regular weight text.

Our comments to you (which you should *not* enter) look like:  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;i&gt;# some comment here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
laptop$ &lt;userinput&gt;pwd&lt;/userinput&gt;           &lt;em&gt;# You type &quot;pwd&quot; but NOT this comment!&lt;/em&gt;
/home/ccttraining42   &lt;em&gt;# the system&#39;s response&lt;/em&gt;
laptop$               &lt;em&gt;# the system&#39;s command prompt&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these exercises, we&#39;ll use the prompt =laptop$= for responses from the shell on the lab laptops, and =gridlab$= (or =gridlab1$=, =gridlab2$=, =gridlab3$=, etc.) for responses from remote shells. 

%NOTE% The actual shell prompts you&#39;ll see may be different from those we show here.

To start, practice cutting text from your this page in your web browser to run a command or set of commands: cut the =pwd= command from the box above and paste it into your terminal window to execute it. This is a good way to avoid making typos while entering commands from the examples.
