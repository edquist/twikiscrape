---+ Condor Challenges

These are a couple of extra challenges to do if (and only if) you have extra time.

---++ Challenge 1

Extend our simple.c program to calculate a more interesting function, perhaps one that takes x and y as input, and calculates z. Make it so that each calculation takes at least two minutes. Ideally, you would have a hard to calculate function, but you can use a sleep if necessary.

Challenge: How many function evaluations can you calculate by the end of the summer school? How many hours of computation can you use?

What is the best way to organize your calculation? Should you simply submit many jobs? Create a DAG with no dependencies? Create a DAG with, say, 100 calculation nodes and 1 node for collating results? Would you rather use Master-Worker? 

---++ Challenge 2

Do you have any extra computation that needs to be done? Real work, from your life outside this summer school? If so, try it out on our Condor pool. Can&#39;t think of something? How about one of the existing distributed computing programs like [[http://www.distributed.net][distributed.net]], [[http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/][SETI@home]], [[http://www.einsteinathome.org/][Einstien@Home]] or others that you know. We prefer that you do your own work rather than one of these projects, but they are options. 

---++ Challenge 3

Do you have an environment (like our R example) that you would like to &quot;bring with you&quot;? Challenge: figure out how to do it! 

---++ Challenge 4

Try to generate other Mandlebrot images. Some possible locations to look at with goatbroat:

&lt;pre style=&quot;margin-left:4em&quot; class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
goatbrot -i 1000 -o ex1.ppm -c 0.0016437219722,-0.8224676332988 -w 2e-11 -s 1000,1000
goatbrot -i 1000 -o ex2.ppm -c 0.3958608398437499,-0.13431445312500012 -w 0.0002197265625 -s 1000,1000
goatbrot -i 1000 -o ex3.ppm -c 0.3965859374999999,-0.13378125000000013 -w 0.003515625  -s 1000,1000
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can convert ppm files with =convert=, like so:

&lt;pre style=&quot;margin-left:4em&quot; class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
convert ex1.ppm ex1.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now make a movie! Make a series of images where you zoom into a point in the Mandlebrot set gradually. (Those points above may work well.) Assemble these images with the &quot;convert&quot; tool which will let you convert a set of JPEG files into an MPEG movie. 

---++ Challeng 5

Try out [[OSGSS2011ExtraMakeflow][Makeflow]]. You can think of it acting like DAGMan, but there several intriguing differences. Now that you understand DAGMan, you should think about how it compares to Makeflow. Why would you use DAGMan or Makeflow? 

These extra exercises for Makeflow were kindly provided by Doug Thain. 

---++ Note: Be Nice
Please be polite. Computers in our Condor pool will run multiple jobs at a time, and these computers are shared with your fellow students. If you have jobs that will use significant computational power or memory, limit your jobs to be kind to your neighbors, unless you run your jobs during off-hours.
