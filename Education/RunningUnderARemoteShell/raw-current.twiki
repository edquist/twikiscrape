---+!! Running Under a Remote Shell


%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

Fully qualified pathnames are necessary when running commands under globus-job-run, because by default it does not start a UNIX &quot;shell&quot; on the remote system and its the shell that implements mechanisms like searching for commands in your =$PATH= variable, and many other features, like input/output redirection ( e.g., =&gt;foo=), pipes (e.g., =cmd1|cmd2=) and =$VAR= substitution. But we can tell globus-job-run to run a shell for you on the remote Grid site, and pass the command string to that remote shell:

Try for example:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%LOGINHOSTSHORT%$ &lt;userinput&gt;globus-job-run %OTHERHOST%/jobmanager-fork /bin/sh -c &quot;grep train /etc/group | wc -l&quot;&lt;/userinput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Experiment for a few minutes with this to try a few shell commands and pipelines on %OTHERHOST%. How similar are these machines?

Common Linux system commands are typically, but not always, found in the same directory on all Linux systems, and this week we&#39;ll be using Grid systems with exclusively Linux-based hosts. In real work, organizations establish conventions for such things, which will be touched on when we discuss production Grids.
