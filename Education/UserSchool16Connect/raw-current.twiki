---+ OSG Connect Sign-up Instructions
In order to participate in the OSG Connect exercises on Tuesday afternoon, you&#39;ll need to sign up for an OSG Connect account. Registrations are manually approved, so we would like you to sign up ahead of time. 

   *  *Step 1* Visit the OSG Connect sign up page ( https://osgconnect.net/signup)  and click on the Continue button. This takes you to a page which will let you create a Globus ID or log in if you already have one. 
     
   *  *Step 2* After you have signed in or created a Globus ID, you will be asked to link an existing account or continue with the current Globus account. Click on the &quot;No Thanks, continue&quot; button to continue the application process.
     
   *  *Step 3* To complete your sign up, submit an application to join the &quot;osg&quot; project. It is important that you *choose your Globus ID in the username dropdown menu*. (If not sure, take a close look at  Figure.3  in the OSG Connect sign up page.)
    
In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that acknowledges the receipt of your application.
