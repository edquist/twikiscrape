---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

The OSG-XD front-end reconfiguration has been completed by Mats to a two server architecture; appears to be running well.  In addition, we now send jobs to FNAL without end-user certs attached.   System is able to quickly dispatch work submitted by users and we appear to be demand limited at present; cannot test the full capability of the new system without a lot more work being submitted by users.

   * OSG-XD frontend status: &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/OSG-XD_front-end_status.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;OSG-XD_front-end_status.JPG&quot; width=&#39;933&#39; height=&#39;442&#39; /&gt;    

In general, the OSG-XD systems continues to utilize about 1M opportunistic hours per week over the last 30 weeks.

   * OSG-VO usage for last 30 weeks: &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/OSG-VO_last_30_weeks.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;OSG-VO_last_30_weeks.JPG&quot; width=&#39;865&#39; height=&#39;685&#39; /&gt;   

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Mine is back from the maternity leave. Will continue attending the meeting. 
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Incident at XSEDE. Various nodes are root comrpomised. Attack vector unknown. Users username and passwords were harvested. Checked the list of compromised users. Two users also have accounts on OSG-XSEDE host. Turned off their account. Four more users have names matching in osg gridmap file. Asked them whether they had any certificates in Xsede accounts. None had. No affect on OSG so far. Still more information is turning up. 
      * Java 6 has many vulnerabilities that are exposed and can be exploited. In a recent test, we found 43 CEs have Java 6 and 21 CEs had Java 7. How can we convince these CEs to upgrade ? 

   * Operations
      * SHA-2 transition set to Dec 1st. 
      * OSG VO started sending certificate-free jobs to Fermilab resources.
