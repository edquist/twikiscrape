---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 20-24K running jobs. There was a significant ATLAS wide drop in the production level Wed-Thu due to introduced configuration parameter, which caused job failures for some software releases. The change was rolled back.
      * One of the main activities during the last four weeks was the recovery of the lost data at BNL, which was completed end of the week. Big chunk of that data was declared unrecoverable. The effort is ongoing to regenerate the high priority data from that list.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.1M pilots processed, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 0.90
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week 
      * Still no BNL data on the transfer graph (GOC ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/15713) 
   * We plan to test SHA2 certificates through USATLAS panda production system soon.
