   * General production status
      * LHC is recovering from the technical stop. Not fully back yet, with some technical issues.

         * average 156K jobs per day
         * failed 68K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%
      * Panda jobs processed, as reported by Panda monitor, on USATLAS sites:
         * 840K panda jobs processed for last week. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week

      * 116448.8 wall clock hours total (106535.3 / 9913.5 = 91.5% success)

---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 354,083.55763, Last Week: 217,482.27536
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 3 (+3)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * no updates this week, waiting for Pulsar glidein dag issue to be resolved (see below)

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * Pulsar Powerflux jobs are submitted via glidein meachanism to four &#39;Powerflux sites&#39;: UFlorida_PG, UCSDT2, Nebraska (Red), LIGO_CIT
   * when dag submitted, for some reason, glidein requests are being made at non-Powerflux sites, e.g. Firefly, OUHEP_OSG
   * jobs start running and fail because the Powerflux data have not been pre-staged to any sites other than the four Powerflux sites mentioned above 
   * currently, we do not know why glidein requests are being made at non-Powerflux sites, Mats and I (Britta) are troubleshooting

---++ Engage (Mats, John)

---++ Metrics (Brian)
   * Starting to cross-train folks on &quot;operational&quot; tasks (monthly review of metrics, WLCG data, CPU normalization).  Goal is to have all the repetitive tasks better documented on the twiki and not dependent on any one person.

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Starting ITB testing
      * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p27.html][VDT update information]]
      * Primarily changes to fulfill CMS requests:
         * Renicing gatekeeper

         * Cleanup script for user accounts
      * Other changes include:
         * Bestman/Bestman2 updates
         * SGE related improvements

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.19
      *       95 (2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      26 are 1.2.19)
      *        2 (1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        0 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
A couple of notes on the 1.2 distribution:
   * we have a core of sites that update to the latest, currently 26 sites to 1.2.19
   * a bunch of sites are at the first 1.2 release they installed; 69 sites have 1.2.1
   * other releases have few sites each, with few exception on releases that had important (advertised) updates, e.g. 12 sites have 1.2.16

---++ Security (Mine)
   * I am off for the afternoon. Here is the report from security team. 
   * Panda/Us-atlas security drill. 
      * We decided to go ahead with the security drill. We are working with Atlas management and Atlas sites to identify 4-5 production sites to participate in the drill. Only the identified sites will be expected to participate. The drill will start on May23rd and end by 28th. We will give more details to identified sites as to what we will expect from them and how they will be graded.
      * Jim Barlow will work with Operations team to inform them of the drill. We do not expect any major support from operations team. There are a few points such as operations should not respond to tickets we open for the drill. Jim will go over the dates and the details of the drill with Operations asap. 
   * The certificate migration work is stalled for another two weeks. In case anybody wonders, Anand will extend his vacation in India two more weeks. This work will resume when he comes back. 
   * Smaller issue (FYI). There has been a SSL renegotiation problem affecting DOEGrids web interface -- the SSL connection were breaking. Goc ticket #10249. We found another solution that could fix the problem form the server side. A ticket will be filed with ESnet service desk. If anyone else has the same problem, please refer them to GOC.
