---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Xin, Armen, Suchandra, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Kevin , Chander
 
---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 7,718 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~699 TB/day


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * Relatively long recovery to more stable operation after the technical stop for LHC. The past week was a good one, with significant data collected. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS ~1.7 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of about 17-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type. Review of all computing resources, squeezing maximum efficiency, including beyond pledged resources, also prevent any waist of analysis resources with low priority stuff, to achieve maximum MC12 production and be ready for summer conferences.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 85%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200~400TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/7wx9jel][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]

   * Production Services Updates - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/05/goc-service-update-tuesday-may-8th-at.html][Notification]]
      * Minor changes to Operations Status Overview, see it [[http://myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][here]]
      * /usr/local on repo.grid.iu.edu to grow to 128 GB from 16 GB (time permitting)
      * www.grid.iu.edu to be retired
      * Physical move of an unused VM host from IUPUI to IUB
         * Will host GOC internal services, (monitor, jump, etc)
   *WMS Glide In Factory
      * Discovered on Thurs May 10 that UCSD Factory hit file descriptor limits.
         * This prevented the factory from submitting new glideins for about 48 hours.
         * We increased the ulimit levels from the default 1024 to 10240.
         * The factory went back up successfully but we hit the limit again on Friday so we increased to  50240.
         * GlideinWMS developers are aware of it and will work on better alert system in the factory to notify of this kind of problem.
      * Began testing Condor 7.6.7 testing on ITB Factory.  Plan to upgrade GOC on next Production window.
      * _An RSV probe to monitor the health of the UCSD factory will be investigated_

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB Release today - Change log notification will be sent upon release. 
      * Rebuilding rsvprocess1/2 with larger disk space (8G &gt; 128G) [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/MYOSG-43][MYOSG-43]]
      * Adding /campus URL for blogs [Requested by Derek W.]
      * Setting up InCommon https access for gratiaweb (service itself needs to be updated still) [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIAWEB-14][GRATIAWEB-14]]

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * The Bosco June 30 release date is %RED%in jeapordy%ENDCOLOR% because the proposed completion date for the Condor file transfer capabiility is June 22.
   * Bosco w/Campus Factory testing is ongoing with positive feedback coming in.
   * Getting some best practices published and deployed campus grid profiles. Need to send an update email to campus-grids list...
   * We have a full-featured partitionable slots configurations running in Madison now, including the defragmentation daemon. Early indications are positive.
