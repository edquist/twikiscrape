-- Main.DanFraser - 30 Aug 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * It is important for sites to make sure that the &quot;Installed Capacities&quot; are listed correctly in OIM, and consistent with WLCG as these will be reported to the WLCG starting in Oct. (Brian)
   * The GOC is now using Puppet for installation and software management. One immediate benefit was that the last upgrade took ~9 hours on the ITB but only ~2.5 hours using Puppet. 
   * Xin confirmed that SE-only publishing is working correctly on Atlas. 
   * LIGO is averaging about 1/3 of its former capacity ~150K hours/wk. 
   * LSST effectively completed its targeted production run of 450 images (Brian)

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Tony, Scott, Derek, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * ~107 khours/day
      * 17163 jobs/day
      * 96% success

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~368 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC commissioning to train the beams for new settings is continuing. Collisions for physics not earlier than the end of this week. ATLAS production was generally stable during the last week at the level of 9k running jobs all the time, mainly simulation jobs. Unfortunately due to the geometry bug in new simulation package many tasks have been aborted, and are re-simulated. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 86%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.5M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 214K jobs per day
         * failed 75K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 95%, walltime - 94%. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 100~300TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * SE-only info publishing to WLCG BDII for all USATLAS T3 sites : it works now. 
      * Open more job slots to OSG users
