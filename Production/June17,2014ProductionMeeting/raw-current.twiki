   * DigiCert host certs problem
      * Fix went to production Friday afternoon
      * Verified to work
   * Users were reporting a host certificate issue that was causing the prefix before a slash to be omitted in the CN after a host certificate is being issued.  We were able to 
     confirm this and requested DigiCert to investigate.  DigiCert discovered what the issue was that prevented the service_name from being added to the CN on the certificate.  
     They implemented the fix last Friday.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded GOC factory to glidienWMS v3_2_5
         * Scott noticed what looked like a huge &quot;drop&quot; in running glideins. In fact what can be seen in our monitoring is a bug fix in v3_2_5 where previously CMS glideins were wrongly magnified by a factor of 10:

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * None
   * Operations
      * Several recent botching mining incidents at Supercomputing centers and university clusters. We have no such incident yet. But it may happen. We notified the ET. We sent out a note to VO managers and security contacts reminding them that such activities are not allowed and they should communicate this to their communities. OSG VO has already took action and added warning messages when a user logs into the osg vo submit node that they can use these machines for scientific purposes only. OSG Connect is also implementing a similar measure. We will write a risk assessment on bitcoin mining and similar activities.
