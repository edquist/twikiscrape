-- Main.BrittaDaudert - 07 Feb 2011

---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Due to delays in the BDII v5, the Operations team is working on adding a third BDII v4 to the round robin. This way even if one of the BDII systems is down, the remaining BDIIs can support the full load. 
   * LIGO hit a maximum usage day on Saturday: between 9k and 12k simultaneous jobs; 259 khours (Britta/Robert)
   * In January ([[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9809][Ticket 9809]]) there was an incorrect downtime recorded by the WLCG. RSV showed correctly that BNL had scheduled downtime; WLCG reported this as unscheduled downtime. Scott to reopen and try to understand what happened. (Rob, Scott). 
   * Neither Burt or Britta received the OSG Metrics report this week. (Britta to file a ticket)
   * CMS Tier-1 is now HTPC enabled (Burt); Dan to provide information on config.ini to Burt in order to start adding the HTPC attributes to GIP.
   * Since HTPC is an upcoming requirement for both CMS and Atlas, Dan has requested that ITB sites begin enabling HTPC and add relevant HTPC tests to be ready for this transition.

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott, Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Machine: LHC to run at sqrt(s) = 7 &lt;nop&gt;TeV; long shutdown not until 2013.  Physics to start in March
   * Last week: 353 khour/day, 89% success
   * CMS Tier 1 now HTPC-enabled
   * Requested that cms voms.fnal.gov be temporarily removed from VO package until it is included in EGI LSC files
 
---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC in preparation for the start of the new run period. First beam expected on Feb.19. Mid-March first stable beams. 
      * ATLAS production was relatively stable during the week at the average level of 10-12k running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. Preparation for reprocessing of Heavy Ion data. Discussions on optimization of the data management scheme for the upcoming run period. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 84%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.5M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 217K jobs per day
         * failed 211K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 88%, walltime - 87%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL dCache billing DB is reopen, gratia report resumed on late Feb 2nd. Transfer rate was around 300~400TB/day in the last several days. 
   * Issues
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : farm group is working on that
