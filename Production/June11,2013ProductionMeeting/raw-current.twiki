   * Operations
      * CILogon Basic CA production roll out at Fermilab. For the U of Indiana, Wisconsin and Chicago, all permissions are obtained. The tests on ITB finished successfully.The change request for FermiGrid production systems will be made this week. expect to roll this out next week. We will also create a special Cilogon RPM for fermilab with the approved three universities.  However, Glow VO has problems submitting jobs via glidein infrastructure. This has nothing to do with Cilogon. They have issues with submitting jobs via the glideins. these issues are not certificate related and they are unable to submit jobs with DOEGrids/Digicert certs either. 
      * Traceability project. Following up with the comments/work requested by Miron at Blueprint. 
      * Starting SHA-2 transition. The support plans will include help for the VOs. For example, reminding VOs what to test, when to test and how to test. This will not be very detailed (changes according to each VO needs) but we will include the most important items.
