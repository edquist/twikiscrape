---++ Engage (Mats)


---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Operational issues/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Had an incident reported on TTU past Wednesday. All grid nodes were compromised at root level.  We think it was a brute force ssh attack. Attacker replaced the sshd daemon. TTU security team will have the final say on this.  Incident is under control now; we moved on to eradication and recovery stages.  we expect TTU to re-install the machines and get back into business soon. Affected users are already received their new certificates. OSG Incident response plan was enacted: announcemet to sites and users were sent; contacted each user and service who has used the compromised nodes during the attack period; continuous monitoring via gratia for proxies. Production was affected because the nodes were taken offline immediately. TTU security team is doing forensics analysis.
   * Software vulnerabilities. 
      * Two important patch announcements. Kernel level vulnerabilities and libxml2 vulnerability. SL released the patch. We alerted our site admins on Friday evening. 
      * NIST released an Important vulnerability with Tomcat and web application languages. We alerted VDT and the GOC team as they may run vulnerable versions. 

   * New IGTF release with accredited production DigiCert CA coming out soon. Preview bundle for testing purposes is released by IGTF. OSG will need to test this soon. 
   * We still need to complete our testing of browsers with CA root certificates which has a short lifetime. This test stems from the issue that DOEGrids has a new certificate. This is described at our last meeting minutes. 
   * Working with VDT and GOC teams to reconcile the CA distribution process. We made a plan of action. We identified the sites who uses GOC rpm. 
   * DigiCert pilot is going well. The final recommendation will be due to end of January.
