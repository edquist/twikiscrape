      * 15,600 jobs/day
      * 96% success rate
   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~395 TB/day
   * FNAL Tier 1 downtime on October 15, details to come 

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * Another productive week for LHC. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now at 3.6fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of 12-13K running jobs, both of simulation and reprocessing job types.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.6M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 86% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200T~400T/day last week, normal. 
   * Issues
      * Cancelled downtime still affects site availability calculation
         * GOC ticket https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/10984
         * results need to be corrected, so that the monthly report won&#39;t be affected. 
         * GOC is helping trace it with SAM folks now.

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3k3lqjh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * It was discovered that the ILC VO&#39;s gratia data was not reaching APEL
      * As a result, there is some discussion about whether all international VOs should publish their accounting information to APEL or only those sites that are signatories to the WLCG MOU.
   * ITB Servers OS Updates
      * Apache !DoS vulnerability patch
      * Updates to kernel and packages
   * Continuing BDII v5 testing: 4th week of continuous load testing. Starting to reveal an abnormal CPU usage increase on is-itb1.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Joined phone meeting last Wednesday 9/21 with Ignas Butenas and Marian Zvada who operate the new Glidein Factory at CERN.  They will be helping out with CMS specific operations for the UCSD/GOC Factories in return for us (Igor and I) helping them out with CERN Factory operations.
      * Registered HCC VO Frontend (Derek Weitzel, UNL) to use GOC Production Factory on Wed 9/21

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release this week, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/09/goc-service-update-1300-utc-september.html][ Release notes]]
   * myosg2.grid.iu.edu and data2.grid.iu.edu to be moved to IUB.
   * Operating system and kernel patches will require reboots.
      * DNS RR will be used on critical services to keep them up during the maintenance. 

---++ Engage (Mats, John)

   * Is still not getting weekly Gratia reports
   * VOMS/VOMRS is down - problem is being worked on

---++ Integration (Suchandra)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.21
      *       96 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       9 are 1.2.21)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
