---++ Action/Significant Items: 

   * request to Tony to fill out GOC ticket about gratia issue with upgrade
   * Scott to characterize site upgrade tickets, done, will do, waiting, won&#39;t/can&#39;t do
   * Scott look at Mine&#39;s ticket about vulnerability _resolved_
      * GOC machines had not enabled the vulnerable feature, 
   * fermilab brought up risk, Mine will talk to Scott about it

---++ Attendees: Scott, Marco, Mine, Jim, Tony, Armen, Xin, Sarah Schmiechen, Suchandra, Chander


---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 13,492 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~260 TB/day

   * Issues
      * We are upgrading to dCache 2.2.  The gratia probes apparently need/use the user DN of the user making a storage request.  However, dCache 2.2 no longer logs the user DN for transfers. (https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/14955)

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS production over the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 22-28K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.2M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 92%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.7 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around ~550TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * ATLAS is actively testing the new OSG client tarballs

---++ Grid Operations Center (Scott T.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/ct2mfy6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production release with OS updates, reboots were required.
   * osg-xsede again operating near or at [[http://osg-xsede.grid.iu.edu/monitoring/condor/condor_1day.png][capacity]].
   * Intermittent BDII warnings from CERN instances. No operational effects observed.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Registered CMS FNAL Production frontend (cmssrv119) to UCSD Factory.
      * We will wait to ensure it is working properly before also adding it to GOC Factory.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * 5th Tuesday, nothing planned.
   * glidein-int may migrate to KVM host (from vmware), implies downtime probably several hours, SDSC is aware and will be notified.

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)

---++ Software (Tim)

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Tested last week:
      * gsi-openssh
      * xrootd
      * bestman2
      * gratia
      * osg-configure
   * Other work:
      * SLURM/CE progressed a little but testing used up most time, looking at issues this week

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.17 / 1.2.32
      *       74 (0) OSG 3.x (       2 are 3.1.17)
      *       34 (1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.32)
OSG GOC tickets have been sent to the OSG 1.2 CEs

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
The OSG VO continues to have good access to opportunistic cycles; averaging over 200K hours per day for the last two weeks.

The OSG-XSEDE host is operating at capacity; need to determine a schedule for hardware upgrade (once GOC is done with the &quot;busy period&quot; associated with OASIS)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Java vulnerability is not affecting OSG significantly. 
      * gsi-ssh. pathc will be released by the software team. opened a ticket with goc to check the status of gsi-ssh login node
   * Operations
      * CVMFS/Oasis risk assessment is accepted by Fermilab. Fermilab grid resources are given permission to use stratum-0 at GOC. 
      * Traceability of end user jobs report. The first draft is completed. Now circulating to a small group of glideinwms and osg members for fact checking. next step is to circulate among a broader audience and finally obtain acceptance from sites.
