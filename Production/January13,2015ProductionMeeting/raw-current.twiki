---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * !OpenSSL vulnerability announced yesterday, does not appear to affect OSG usage, rated low impact.
   * finishing the documentation for the HTCondor drill.
   * we are aware that HIAST CA is causing operational problems. e will remove this CA at the next update. 
   * Fermilab completed its Shibboleth  IdP and thinking about sending its sets to CIlogon Basic CA.
   * Examining the impact of a gratia probe that is being retired.
   * Requests from couple VOs that run at Fermilab to be able to sh into worker nodes to debug their jobs. Fermilab does not allow ssh into worker nodes. How does other VO and sites handle this?
   * Working with OSG storage group and SDCA VO to ease their access to storage elements. SCDA VO only needs read access to data. All resources in OSG including Fermilab allow open read access without any credentials. So, these users ideally should not have to obtain any certificates to read data. we are working towards this goal to help this VO.
