-- Main.DanFraser - 28 Apr 2009


Individual scientists across the United States who are members of the scientific collaborations of the Large Hadron Collider use local resources to access and analyze their physics  data. They use the large Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities to access stored data and run large-scale and experiment defined data processing. 

These scientists own and control their local &quot;Tier-3&quot; computing resources. These can consist of local clusters in a University Department or even individual PCs.  They can be used locally, may be allocated to office LHC analysis, or may be shared with other science collaborations. 

Tier-3s have no MOU&#39;d commitment to the World Wide LHC Computing Grid Collaboration and are thus not supported under the umbrella of the software and computing projects, maintenance and operation. 

The Open Science Grid project is collaborating with the US ATLAS and US CMS collaborations to support and facilitate the effectiveness of the Tier-3s as a coherent, but diverse, community.
