---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the last week was quite stable most of the time, at the average level around 32-35K running jobs. As grid started to run out of jobs over the weekend, the running jobs level dropped to about 15K. Monday new tasks were injected so production came back to initial levels.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.8 M pilots processed, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 87%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.6M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week

   * Oasis developers meeting in Indianapolis 14-15 Nov.
      * Plan to enable content update via condor job
      * Add administrator and user defined &quot;Probes&quot; to enforce policy/verify content before publication
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded GOC Production factory to glideinWMS 3.2.2 on November 12th
         * Munin shows a slight increase in total CPU and memory usage in v3 vs v2, but we still have a good amount of %idle CPU and free memory available.
         * We still have no explanation for why swap space slowly fills up but overall the rate of swapping looks much lower in v3.
         * Now all production factories are running v3, so frontends can start upgrading to glideinWMS v3 as well.
      * Made HTCondor 8.0.x the default for glideins to use in all factories.

Production on OSG-XD is proceeding smoothly and averaging about 200K hours per day for the last two weeks.  But we cannot seem to get more than about 11K cores; we need to investigate.  OSG_PNNL and SMU_HPC sites are back to providing cycles to vo=osg.

The Duke Nuclear Physics group has been very active recently with ~600K hours in the last week.  We have a new group at Rutgers (Project = NWChem) who plans to run on OSG.

The OSG Display had problems (first noticed Friday) which appear to have been resolved today (Tuesday).   1) the gratia db was behind; 2) a SLURM site was reporting very high (ridiculous)  CPU time for several jobs.  [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/17945][Ticket number 17945]]

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * perfsonar incident from previous week believed to be due to compromised local account, not a problem specific to perfsonar system.
