---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * The Atlas Tier-1 has turned off reporting data transfers due to the internal database filling up. 

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC will continue running on 2012. Beam energy for 2012 to be decided later. For 2011 no changes of the beam energy. ATLAS production was relatively stable during the week (except during CERN DB downtime), at the average level of 10-12k running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 87%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 685K managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 98K jobs per day
         * failed 156K jobs (~90K of them failed in ES due to SE issue)
         * average efficiency:  jobs     - 81%
      * OSG gratia shows spike in failed jobs count on Jan 25~26, that&#39;s due to the downtime of cern ATLAS DB upgrade. No real job lose. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * OSG gratia doesn&#39;t have BNL T1 data transfer rate since Jan 15, due to ongoing space cleanup in dcache billing DB of BNL dcache.  Missing data will be restored once the maintenance is done. 
   * Issues
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : farm group is working on that

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.16
      *       92 (-3) OSG 1.2.X resources (      19 are 1.2.16)
      *        3 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
