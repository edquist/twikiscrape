---++ Action/Significant Items: 
   * Job Manager Count as seen in Operations report is confusing, we need to discuss what is being counted in both the version report and the job manager report. Tim C and Rob Q will have a 1on1 conversation to see if we can begin to understand these numbers.

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
Over the last weekend, on Sunday, June 1, the OSG VO was able to access over 20K cores.  This lasted for a few hours but then we ran out of jobs since the submit host ran out of resources needed to spawn new jobs.

---++ Security (Mine)

   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Couple more new incidents at XSEDE. No effects on OSG
   * Operations
      * The OSG IDP is completed. The service is requested by OSG Council. It allows osg users to get onboard with osgconnect and other Shib-aware services. Please note that OSG idP authenticates users based on their X509 certificates. It does not perform any uname/passwd authentication. We will transition the service to the OSG Operations. 
      * WLCG has long been asking for a central automated banning service. WLCG had designed Argus to provide this functionality and had been using this. We are still announcing urgent bans manually through email. We found a solution. Instead of having a separate central banning service, we will install a VOMS server that only advertises banned user. Brian made the changes to GUMS configuration such that the blacklist VO mappings overrides everything in GUMS and the users gets banned. he also simplified the existing banning procedure and it now is a only a single push of a button. the new GUMS can get the blacklist from the CERN based Argus service too. We have not moved anything into production. We welcome any feedback from sites.
