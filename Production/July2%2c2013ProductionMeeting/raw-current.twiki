---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the last week was overall stable, at the average level around 18-26K running jobs. There is still not enough load of jobs to keep all the resources busy all the time.
      * During the week significant part of the activity of the ATLAS distributed computing experts was directed towards recovery of the files lost during the storage failure at BNL. Recovery system is still running, and in parallel manual effort is going to find (if possible) and replicate those lost files from other sites needed to finish high priority tasks.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilots processed, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 0.86
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.4 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week 
      * Still no BNL data on the transfer graph (GOC ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/15713) 
   * Issues

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
The !NoVA experiment wants to be able to run at non-Fermilab sites; we have a call with them tomorrow to understand what work they have done, what are the issues, and what we can do to help them; Marko Slyz will act as OSG User Support lead on this project.

Snowmass usage seems to be tapering off; we plan to meet with them soon to understand their future plans for using OSG in opportunistic mode (and the plans for archiving the data that was created via this simulation work).

Mats is working with a couple of new OSG-XSEDE users in helping them adapt their applications to run on OSG; of interest here is that one of these users wants to use BLAST which is also of interest to the Indiana genome analysis group.

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * No new security incidents/vulnerabilities so far this week.
   * Mine on leave for 3 months, please open GOC ticket or email security team or Kevin with security issues. Kevin on vacation Friday.

   * New CA bundle corresponding to last weeks igtf bundle release being tested for next osg release.
