---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status. 
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was mostly stable, at the average level of 50-60K running job slots. No pilots, and job rate at BNL dropped on Sunday due to failure to restart the GUMS service after the host certificate update. Recovered after the restart. But overall production level was a bit on a lower side last two days as there were not enough new production tasks to run.       
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.2M pilots, 3.2M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 81% (for single core jobs)
