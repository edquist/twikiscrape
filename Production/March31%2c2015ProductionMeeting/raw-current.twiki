---++++ Upcoming, real soon now
   * Oasis II, or at lease a subset thereof
      * Look for a release note 7/Apr
   * There will be update throttling
      * Large updates can bog down the strata 1 replica
      * Needs to be installed on the stratum 0, basically refuses to do an update exceeding certain parameters
      * The &quot;do nothing&quot; option is off the table, long updates are affecting worker nodes.
      * Parameters are not defined.
