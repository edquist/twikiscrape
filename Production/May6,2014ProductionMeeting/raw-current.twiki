---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
!GlueX is close to finishing their Data Challenge #2 using OSG opportunistic resources; they used ~5.5M opportunistic hours in the last 30 days.  They have struggled with effectively using Purdue-RCAC (seems similar to what the osg VO has been experiencing for the last few months; need to pursue again).

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Problems
      * CRL problems are fixed now. The issue was because aching mechanism used by fetch-crl looks at http header expire value (7 days) to download a new CRL file. In the meantime,  the next update value contained in the CRL file was reduced to 3 days. So the fetch-crl could not pull down any new CRLs because it thought the CRL files did not expire. But of course the next update field was already expired in 3 days but it was too soon to download a new CRL file (7 days). So the authentication failures started. We are going through a root-cause analysis and change management review. We are setting up a meeting to go over the lessons learned from this incident. 
      * An incident at XSEDE , user banned in XSEDE. No affect on OSG. 
   * Operations
      * Time for security controls are approaching. Security team will contact you this summer.
