      * Collaboration with U Hawaii, &quot;Marine Biology&quot; has potential for large scale use.

      * who makes the ticket to request update? See [[https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/25783][for example]]
      * Was Anand, then Kevin, have not received one recently.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * glideinWMS developers released v3_2_11_2. We updated GOC ITB and are currently testing it.
      * Continue testing glideinWMS v3_2_11_2, may upgrade SDSC factory assuming testing goes well.
   * OSG-Connect
      * &lt;img src=&#39;http://osgconnect.net/accounting-summary/data/osg/daily_hours_by_project.png&#39;&gt;
      * Unexpected web outage Thursday 9/17 when a KVM host failed. Services resumed within ~2h as VMs were migrated to another host. No lasting damage or data loss.
      * Accounting: utilization has been underreported to Gratia for $longtime due to undetected backlog in gratia probe queue. ~600k job history files piled up in excess of 1y back. Trigger unknown; possibly a very large influx of jobs during a period that Gratia was unavailable. However probe processing time is exponential due to full directory scan *per entry*. Once Gratia probe queue exceeds some breaking point, it can no longer drain as quickly as it fills. Constant monitoring of Gratia queue required. Anyway: full backlog processed as of 10pm Thursday. Many months of retrospective history uploaded to Gratia server.
