---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.16 / 1.2.32
      *       74 (5) OSG 3.x (      14 are 3.1.16)
      *       33 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.32)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Java vulnerbaility. sent to software team for investigating if affects VDT
   * Operations
      * Traceability of end user jobs without certs. Completed the security exercise with osg factory and nebraska site. gathered most of the necessary information. Writing the first draft of our report. 
      * Helped Snowmass users access to BNL with CIlogon Basic certs. 
      * Completed technical tests with using Cilogon Basic CA to access Fermi test resources for Glow VO users. All technical problems were resolved. Waiting to hear from Gow VO whether the user workflow is acceptable for them. 
      * Oasis/CVMFS risk assessment will be presented to Fermilab security team. We will ask them to permit Fermi grid resources to utilize GOC stratum0.
