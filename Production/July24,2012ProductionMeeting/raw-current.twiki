---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Still having an issue with CMS glidein jobs being put into &quot;Hold&quot; status. (Rob) Have requested that Jeff file a Condor ticket. Alain, will prod some of the Condor folks to look at this issue.
   * Mine contacted the EGI ops team that run Pakiti to explore the option of OSG sites using their Pakiti server rather than running our own central server. They are bringing this up internally and we should hear back within a few weeks.

      * Between 1:00 pm and 4:00 pm (PDT) today we will migrate the UCSD Factory hard drives to newer hardware to see if it helps with our current load issues.
         * We don&#39;t expect a long downtime but the other factories will continue to serve the frontends while UCSD is down.

---++ Integration (Suchandra)

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.6 / 1.2.29
      *       34 (2) OSG 3.x (      13 are 3.1.6)
      *       66 (-1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       4 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
We will be talking with !ExTENCI / SAGA tomorrow to evaluate whether they are a good candidate for using iRODS based OSG Public Storage.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Incidents/Vulnerabilities
      * No emergencies. 
      * Evaluated the sudo vulnerability. Turns out does not affect osg sites. Made a blog posting. will not make an announcement.
   * Operations
      * Phasing out old layout certificate bundles from production. Checked the logs for CA bundles RPM and tarball packages. 
         * For RPMs, 18 unique machines are downloading the osg-ca-certs-compat RPM bundles. 19 unique machines are downloading the igtf-ca-certs-compat RPM bundles. 211 unique machines are downloading the osg-ca-certs RPM bundles. 8 unique machines are downloading the igtf-ca-certs RPM bundles 
        * for tarballs: FNAL and SMU downloads the new layout. 
         * Focus is on checking VOMS versions. We know the older VOMS version did not work with the new layout. 
      * Updating the CA bundles at sites automatically. Recent RSV failure due to sites needing to perform a manual yum update. Waiting on software team to send us their decision document. 
      * RSV CA probe. We contacted WLCG Security officer and EGI ops teams as to whether we can increase the time limit after which probe reports a failure if a site does not update its ca bundle. Found out that we can increase it up to 8 days. Currently investigating whether we can reduce this probe criticality to medium. 
      * Pakiti service. Sent an inquiry to EGI ops team whetehr they allow OSG sites subscribed to their instance. Technically this is possible. Talked to the developer, the software funding does not seem to be an issue.
