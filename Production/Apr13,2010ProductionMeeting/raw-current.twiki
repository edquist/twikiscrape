---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Burt is out with Jury Duty on Tuesdays for the next few months but agreed to find a replacement person to represent CMS Grid services until he is back.
   * Atlas data rates were consistent between Ganglia and Gratia and verifyied the increase to over 400 TB/day a few days ago. There is still some concern about the rates dropping to near zero about 12 days ago. Will continue to watch data transfer rates closely at BNL and cross-compare any anomalies between Ganglia and Gratia. (Xin)
   * The GOC will transition to the Web Services mechanism for ticket transfers with RT (BNL) tomorrow at 10am (Rob)
   * CMS Tier-3 tickets are now being routed through the newly setup CMS T3 support center. (Rob)
   * Three sites made the transition from OSG 1.0 to 1.2.

      * Ticket emails will appear to come from osg [at] tick.globalnoc.iu.edu from now on
      * Support centers with whom we do ticket exchange contacted
      * *Tested*: we have tested exchange with all major SCs with whom we do TX including [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8374][GGUS]] (unaffected, uses GOC-TX, still confirmed), [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8376][USATLAS]], [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8377][USCMS/FNAL Remedy (Gratia as example destination)]], [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8378][VDT]]
   * *Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * *BNL RT*
         * Initial round of testing complete, declared ready for production use; follow up items [new features] from Jason @ BNL being discussed --  stay tuned. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * *GGUS*
         * *Revisiting*: USCMS had question about origin of alarm tickets from training/ITB systems; We had contacted GGUS admins about this...
            * GGUS developers test alarm mechanism to US-T1 sites after each production release (usually last Wednesday of each month); changes in release date, if any, are announced in advance.
            * GGUS developers may occasionally create alarm tickets on GGUS-Train but these tickets do *not* send a text message to the relevant party; however these tickets will create corresponding GOC-Ticket-ITB tickets, and consequently corresponding support center tickets (for example: on BNL&#39;s production RT system)
            * GOC requested that GGUS clearly demarcate test alarms from their training/ITB system - they will try but can&#39;t promise.
      * *BNL RT*
         * Recommended to USATLAS management that this us ready for real production tickets; OSG management has already approved; waiting on response from John Hover/Michael Ernst.
         * [[http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AQGl_1gJKDWDZGY5ZnR6anZfMjFmMmpzZmc1cA&amp;hl=en#Transition_from_email_based_ex_7272405605382354][GOC-TX  section with detailed transition proposal]]
      * *FNAL Remedy*
         * Further connections issues and problem with web service interface reported to Remedy developers; Not high priority at FNAL
         * No progress to report
      * *VDT*, *PROD_SLAC*, *UC_CI*, *SBGrid*
         * GOC has promised simple instructions on how to setup RT to use GOC-TX; depending on ease and priority, these SCs may adopt use of GOC-TX
      * We urge everyone to move to using using GOC-TX -- contact GOC if you do ticket exchange with us! (We have initiated contact with our ticket exchange collaborators about this)
         * NERSC will likely continue to use email based exchange; GOC may add additional module to GOC-TX if feasible to enhance email based exchange for any SC that is not able to participate in web-services based exchange

   * *Top Level WLCG BDII Monitoring*
      * GOC is working out details with CMS; Monitor top level WLCG BDIIs (list of IPs RR&#39;ed by DNS) for presence of recent data for all WLCG-Interop-BDII enabled OSG resources
      * Action items upon finding a problem still not clear - being worked out with CMS and OSG management

---++ Engage (Mats, John, Chris)

10 users utilized 36 sites

59126 jobs total (36771 / 22355 = 62.2% success)

90990.7 wall clock hours total (75016.1 / 15974.6 = 82.4% success)


No production issues. Trash/Engagement team will not be able to make this call due to travels and conflicts.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and (variation from last week in parenthesis).
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.8
      *       74 (3) OSG 1.2.X resources (      23 are 1.2.8)
      *        6 (-2) OSG 1.0.X resources (       1 are 1.0.6)
      *        8 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * D0
      * MC Production average 8 M Events/week. 70,000 wall-hours/day at 80% efficiency.
      * File delivery problems now resolved at UNL. 
      * Looking to increase efficiency at available sites. E.g., efficiency is:
         * poor at ce.grid.unesp.br, osg-ce.sprace.org.br, umiss001.hep.olemiss.edu.
         * not fully satisfactory at osg.rcac.purdue.edu.
     
   * CDF, Fermi-VO, SBGrid: production proceeding smoothly.  
   
   * !IceCube external review is coming up.
   
   * !CompBioGrid is moving site to another location on U Connecticut campus.
   
   * GPN users faced problem with (possibly default) values in VO&#39;s VOMS server setting. Resolved by increasing &lt;i&gt;VOMS.request.vo.membership.lifetime&lt;/i&gt;. Looking for more direction from Security team.
   
   * GROW team is thinking to operate as a CMS Tier-3 site.
   
   * No current update on CHARMM production.
   
   * After a green flag from Council, will start next cycle of updates to:
      * Scientific publications resulting from substantial use of OSG.      
      * Database of stakeholder plans/needs and requirements, with emphasis on: (i) current production averages, (ii) future production estimates. 
      
   * Collating VOs&#39; experiences on &lt;i&gt;Production Jobs Scheduling Mechanism&lt;/i&gt;. Expecting input from D0, SBGrid, nanoHUB, !IceCube, GLUE-X.
