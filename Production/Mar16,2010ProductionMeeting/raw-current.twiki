-- Main.DanFraser - 02 Mar 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * First 7 Tev (center of mass) collisions at the LHC planned for end of March. 
   * Atlas production returning to normal levels (Xin)
   * D0 should be set to run on UTA, ready to test. (Xin)
   * Brian to follow up with John W on sites not reporting (Metrics)
   * New VDT security release 1.2.8 planned shortly. This will be an opportunity for sites running 1.0.x to upgrade (especially important if they are running Condor). Sites that upgrade will automatically be configured to point to the correct Gratia collector. 
   * Rob E. is completing a document that describes the problems LIGO has encountered to get jobs running on many different sites. This will be used (in conjunction with other data) to inform possible strategies for helping other VOs not need to repeat this effort. (Dan to work with Abhishek, Rob E., others on this.)
   * GOC production freeze scheduled to be lifted. Next production changes planned for Mar 30. (Rob)
   * Problem with DOE DIsplay showing long strings of 0&#39;s was corrected (Brian)

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Xin, Armen, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 101 khour/day, 91% success.
   * OSG All Hands meeting was productive
   * Expect many Tier 3s to begin ramp-up in a few months
   * LHC status: Technical Stop -- ramp studies to 3.5 &lt;nop&gt;TeV/beam scheduled for tomorrow evening CET.  First sqrt(s) = 7 &lt;nop&gt;TeV collisiions tentatively scheduled for 3/30.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * Last week the production was quite stable with simulation jobs at the average level of 7K running jobs. LHC commissioning is in progress. Very short collision run on Sunday with 1.18TeV per beam. Studies with 3.5TeV per beam energies during the week. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.4M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 202K jobs per day
         * failed 118K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer is ~100 TB/day. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage: D0 expert Robert Illingworth explained to us what&#39;s needed to run D0 data transfer etc, Mark at UTA USATLAS T2 will verify that D0 workflow works with the current clients available on our T2s. 
      * T3 sites are looking for instructions of publishing the SE information to cern BDII. Is there standalone package of installing and configuring just CEMon for a site?

No more GGUS-GOC tickets using old email based exchange.
         * Change to Affected Site behavior postponed. Production release scheduled on March 10th was initially going to include a change from resource_name to resource_group_name for the Affected Site parameter. Per GOC/OSG request, this change was postponed to early April. GOC&#39;s March 30th update to GOC-TX will include code that can handle existing and new values for that field.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * Spoke last week with D0, CDF, Fermilab-VO, GLUE-X, SBGrid, !IceCube, ALICE, DOSAR, !NanoHUB, NYSGrid, OSG-VO/CHARMM, GPN, potential new VO HCC. Follow up in progress in coming weeks.

   * No major production issues this week.
   
   * D0 
      * MC Production average 7.9 M Events/week; 100,000 wall-hours/day at 80% efficiency. Some D0-internal problems in submission infrastructure. 
      * Caltech SE added. Discussion moving forward with ATLAS/Mark@UTA on SE access.

   * Possible need for more: (1) operational policies/recommendations and (2) software artifacts to verify enforcement. Examples:
      * SBGrid
         * Open discussion on OSG policy on WN client.
      * GLUE-X
         * Offline discussion on OSG policy on POSIX account requirements; a site&#39;s support for multiple VOs; multiple sites&#39; support for a specific VO.
      
   * Starting next cycle of updates to:
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements][Stakeholder Plans/Needs and Requirements]] (with Production and STG). 
      * Scientific publications resulting from substantial use of OSG (with OSG Communications &amp; Council). 

---++ Security (Mine)

   * Incident at a Tir 3 site over the weekend. Most likely a false positive. Nevertheless it is treated as though a real attack. Communications and ticketing system worked fine. I got immediately alerted at 9 am on Saturday morning. 
   * Setting up a CA cache at ITB for testing the new IGTF CA bundle distribution. this is a heads-up for ITB folks
   * New ticket reported by Rob about FTS service. Mine will follow up. 
   * Bug in openssl 0.9 on Debian platforms. it breaks GSI. Alain is working on it and will make an announcement to LIGO. No work for security team.
