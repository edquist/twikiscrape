-- Main.DanFraser - 27 May 2009
---++ Action Items:
   * Next meeting Wed June 3 at 10:00 FNAL 9th floor NE conference center.
      * Still deciding on weekly/bi-weekly format
   * Explore how to connect Tanya&#39;s test SEs with a CMS loaded CE (Rob, Tanya)
      * May stress test using STEP &#39;09 tests
   * Explore whether Atlas T2 stress tests be extracted as a T3 test set (Doug)
   * Understand the use case for Athena/Root files (Doug)
   * Dan to schedule Brian to discuss Hadoop FS
   * Explore openness of OSG to support (one or more) base VMs for T3s that Atlas and CMS could build on (Dan)

---++ Attendees: 
   * Rob Snihur, Doug Benjamin, Tanya Levshina, Dan Fraser

---++ Notes:
   * There is a strong interest in using VMs to support T3s
      * Atlas will be pushing for VMs
      * Collaboration with CernVM and other groups (e.g. Canada, UTexas)
      * Would it make sense for OSG to support base VMs?
   * CMS T3s currently happy with NFS
      * T3s only want S/W that CMS T2s are using; Not willing to test XRootD.
      * CMS needs to understand when NFS is likely to break down (Stress tests)
      * Only with this data can we encourage T3s to do something different (if needed)
   * Testing configurations should use current hardware if at all possible
      * Adding more cores can have a dramatic impact on I/O - CPU relationship
   *
