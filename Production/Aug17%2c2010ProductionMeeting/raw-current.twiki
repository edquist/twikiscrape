-- Main.DanFraser - 10 Aug 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * GOC has produced an updated punch list to ensure that BDIIs are working properly when they are restarted. This should prevent outages such as occurred last week. Burt, Xin to double check this list and provide feedback.
   * Xin to start a conversation between folks configuring Condor at BNL with Condor experts at FNAL.
   * Condor bug on the CMS T1 at FNAL on the calculation of the number of jobs running in Condor 7.2.1. Plan to upgrade soon. (Burt)
   * Burt noted two problems with the BDII software at CERN, although it is not clear if these are still in the latest version 5.0.8. Until these are fixed, OSG should not upgrade.
      * Glue SiteSponsorField is single valued and not multi-valued
      * Data gets stale and piles up
   * OSG planning to upgrade to BDII 5.0.8 in the ITB for testing.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC is continuing mostly stable data taking, and continuing to improve the luminosity.ATLAS production was low at the very beginning of the week and then ramped up to the usual average of 8-9k running jobs, mostly simulation.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.0M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 73%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 917k managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 131K jobs per day
         * failed 37K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 91%, walltime - 93%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~500TB/day.

---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Released OSG 1.2.12 last week
      * Gip update (SE only reporting, misc. bug fixes)
   * About to start testing OSG 1.2.13 candidate
      * Xrootd updates
      * Gratia updates

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.12
      *       87 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       5 are 1.2.12)
      *        4 (1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        4 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
OSG Site Administrators workshop last week
   * 38 attendees, mostly found the material new and interesting
   * some successful installation
   * agenda: http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3429
   * survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FHMQP25

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * There were quite a few vulnerability announcements on openSSL and RedHat. we watch all of that and decided none of it affects us majorly
   * No incidents or problems
   * Focusing on the documentation effort to meet the deadline
   * the test with Clemson in regards to Shibboleth framework moves on without problems. technically we do not have to do any more work. Clemson has an identity provider that can be integrated with CILogon CA and clemson users can get instantenous short-lived certificates.
