| # | Owner | Action/Significant Item | Open Date | Close Date |
|20| All | Changes to ReSS? IP information may need CEMon (Tomcat) Restart for resources still at version 1.0.x of OSG. Marco will update the agenda with the 1.0.x resource names | 5/3/2011 | |
|19| All | ATLAS recovered well from problems related to the CERN VOMS update that caused a hiccup early last week. | 5/3/2011 | |
|18| All | Upcoming testing of new DOEGrids Certificate format in production is about a month away. | 4/26/2011 | |
|17| All | UCSD Glide-In factory Outage affected Analysis not Production, and this was recovered relatively quickly. Request for second Glide-In Factory reiterated. | 4/26/2011 | |
|16| All | LIGO/BNL,AGLT2 Issues: This needs to be looked at closer and is preventing LIGO from fully utilizing ATLAS resources. Rob will chat with Dan about this and give him the details. | 4/26/2011 | |
|15| All | Karthik discussed the issue of accounting for hyperthreading. We identified the key players so that he can set up a meeting to follow up specifically on the details of this. | 4/19/2011 | |
|14| Rob | The new BDII configuration seems to be stable and working well. | 4/19/2011 | |
|13| All | The number of sites reporting has dropped to about 88 (down from over 100 about 6 weeks ago), Dan asked Rob to take a look at this. | 4/19/2011 | |
|12| All | LIGO production is ramping up again. | 4/19/2011 | |
|11| Burt | CMS is running at an all time high number of hours of ~440Khours/day. | 4/19/2011 | |
|10| Mine | DOEGrids Root CA CRL problems. DOEgrids moved the CRL service to a new machine (new URL, hardware, etc). All grid nodes hits the old location and gets failures. The problem started yesterday. Esnet put a re-direct from the old server location which fixed the problem. Should not affect the grid access. But it affected web access via CERN Single Sign on Service. The issue is a bit more complicated between CERN and DOEgrids. CERN uses a ADFS and requires a special certificate type from DOEgrids ca. It still somehow hits the unavailable CRL location. Work is ongoing. Burt noted that while the Single Sign On problem is not a showstopper, it is painful to navigate around. | 4/19/2011 | |
|9| All | Periodic outages in the GridFTP? RSV probes at a handful of sites were reported. This has been traced to periodic running of Pigeon tests. Corrected data will need to be resent to the WLCG. | 4/12/2011 | |
|8| All | SAM data consumer at CERN was down over the weekend. RSV reports have &quot;Unknown&quot; status on Sunday. Data has been resent. | 4/12/2011 | |
|7| All | Robert E. drained the E@H queue and has been upgrading the LIGO E@H version to 1.5. This is the reason for the large dropoffs in E@H jobs for the last two weeks. It is up and running again now. | 4/12/2011 | |
|6| All | BDII services have moved outside of the UI firewalls. Immediate network improvements were noted as in the charts below. These improvements are so significant that a third BDII may not be needed. However, the third BDII, IS4, was placed into round robin today. So far there have not been any seg faults. | 4/12/2011 | |
|5| Dan, All | HTPC still waiting for a test job to integrate. Dan to follow up. | 4/5/2011 | |
|4| All | Burt noted (again) several important LHC fixes needed in the VDT. Dan to make sure this is on Alain&#39;s short term radar after the WN_Client. | 4/5/2011 | |
|3| Rob | BDII #3 was rebuilt using a 32bit OS and the seg faults have gone away. Plan to put this in Round Robin at the next change cycle | 4/5/2011 | |
|2| All | GOC is planning to move services outside the IU firewall since the internal network performance is significantly degraded. | 4/5/2011 | | 
|1| All | There was a 4-hour outage at the DOE Grids CA on Friday. Mine is working on a follow up plan.  Services were restored late Friday evening (about 22:30 EST). OSG was not notified until Monday that this service was stable; Users need to resubmit any cert requests made during this period. | 4/5/2011 | |
