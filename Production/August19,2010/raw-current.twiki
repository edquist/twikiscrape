---+++ Notes:
   * Next meeting will be in two weeks
   * AthenaMP (Atlas)
      * The HTPC team discussed different scenarios with the athenaMP folks at LBL and decided to recommend the approach of updating the Panda pilot code to utilize the HTPC RSL for targeting whole machines.
      * The first OSG test site will be OU. We pointed them to the correct RSL code. 
      * The athenaMP folks will contact and work with the Panda pilot team and the CERN athenaMP team to a) create a separate Panda queue and b) make the RSL implementation on the pilots.
      * The HTPC team is available to have discussions with the Panda team if needed. 
   * Glide-in Configuration at Wisconsin
      * Greg running into problems with getting the factory working.
      * Greg to make plans to come to FNAL soon (within the next several weeks) to work with the GlideinWMS team. (Greg, Burt)
   * HTPC availability on Tier-1
      * Burt now has all the data to test the Condor scheduling system. Once this test is working satisfactorily, he will work on the monitoring problem. Timeframe: next few weeks. (Burt)
   * HTPC Accounting
      * Philippe needs expert help on LSF and PBS to determine how to extract the (number of cores) per (whole machine) to make the accounting correct. 
         * Horst followed up with the Sooner folks to see if they know the answer for LSF
         * Dan to work with Brian to follow up and find expertise on the PBS side. 
   * HTPC at RENCI
      * Stephen Cox is working on getting an Amber 9 MPICH parallel version working and running on the local RENCI system to start. Then will progress to running some jobs on the OSG, first with OSGMM.
