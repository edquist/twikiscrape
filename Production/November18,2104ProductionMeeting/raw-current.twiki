---+++ This Week

   * Grid Operations Center
      * No release this cycle
      * Rob out this week and next
      * Soichi out Friday through next week
      * Coverage assured through the holidays 
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * We have a fairly extensive outage this week on Thursday for our users.  Central dcache and enstore will be down for a sotware and database upgrade for most of the day.  Doesn&#39;t really effect OSG users too much.  All Fermigrid machines (including gatekeepers, batch system heads, etc) will be rebooted to pick up a new kernel but no long outages for any particular server.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Plan to start migration to glideinWMS rpm installation on GOC-ITB factory
   * OSG-Connect
      * Planning on migrating user home directories to separate service, no time scheduled but should result in minimal downtime for users


---++ Software (Tim C.)

   * Ongoing (and no significant news)
      * HTCondor CE
         * Making the HTCondor CE default &lt;span style=&quot;color: #f60;&quot;&gt;for new installations&lt;/span&gt; (will not affect existing ones)
         * CE Collector: Working at GOC; phase IIb (final) started, planned for December
         * Working on an overview document
         * Scalability testing: raising some artificial limits to get past 10K jobs
      * Investigating !GratiaWeb instability with Juan at FNAL
      * Wrapping up some more small changes to GUMS
      * EL 7: Working on various Java builds for the worker node client; will review progress and plan next steps
      * New RSV !perfSONAR probe &amp;ndash; actively testing and revising
      * UW–Madison Koji instance no longer supports SSLv3, developers must have updated client
      * Testing the !PanDA packaging a little, but mostly waiting on ATLAS now
      * IPv6 evaluation of OSG software &amp;ndash; start testing soon (hopefully)
      * Working on adding a UW ITB site, to be maintained by Software/Release teams
