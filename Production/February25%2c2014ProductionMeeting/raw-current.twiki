---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

OSG VO production continues smoothly at greater than 1.5M hours per week; sometimes over 2M hours in a week.  

Need to work with GOC staff to upgrade file system on the OSG-XD submit node.

Completed the change of groups/priorities on the OSG-XD node per recommendations from Miron; system seems to be working smoothly.  Now we only have two groups: 1) XSEDE users who have not exhausted their allocation; and 2) all other users who compete via fair-share for opportunistic cycles.  Group 1 is allocated 50% of cores but rarely uses anywhere close to that.


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * Significant security breach at univ of Maryland. Has NOTHING to do with OSG, just informing student and faculty that may have attended U of Maryland. Please spread the word that 300,000 student and staff records of birthdate, name, SSN, have been stolen. Again this has nothing to do with OSG
   * Operations
      * New layout CA packages are coming out in next CA bundle release. 
      * If you are a member of CMS, please continue to use ca.cern.ch/ca to get SHA-1 signed certs. SHA-2 signed certs do not work with CERN VOMRS.
      * Glow VO evaluation is almost done. Just wrapping up the documentation to present to fermilab. Will present this to Fermilab this Friday
