---++ Networking (Shawn)

---++ Production Support (Bo)
   * &lt;img src=&quot;http://reports.grid.iu.edu/reports/opp-week.png&quot;&gt;
   * From OSG-Council Meeting - &quot;Report back to the Council when an understanding of the constraints of Glow submissions to OSG (10K jobs in parallel?) are understood – Bo&quot; - Any activity here? 
      * Need to understand from Miron who the right person on the CHTC side to work with (Nate Yehle&#39;s replacement?) on this is. The hope is that because of the recent success of demonstrating 50K jobs on the OSG VO flock, it should be relatively easy to understand what scaling limitations, if any, are present for GLOW.

---++ Software (Mat S.)
   * Still a few items being worked on past the February development freeze:
      * CVMFS-over-StashCache work, including CVMFS 2.2.0 – waiting for final release
      * Add option in VOMS Admin to avoid CA certificate check – having issues, trying again
      * Hadoop coming to EL 7, !GridFTP and !XRootD plugins will be next month
   * Had a little hiccup with batlab.org domain, temporarily fixed now, looking at a longer-term fix
   * Still working (slowly) on eliminating software.grid.iu.edu
   * Need to turn OSG CE data collection workflow into something more robust and reusable
   * Lots of site support, especially with CEs (Caltech, Clemson, Harvard, OSC)
