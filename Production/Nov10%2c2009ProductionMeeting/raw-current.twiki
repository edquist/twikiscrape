---++ Attendees:
   * Britta, Suchandra, Marco, Rob Q., Chander
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * Due to the on-going USATLAS T2/T3 workshop, Armen and Xin will miss today&#39;s phone call. 

   * User Analysis Test (UAT) is completed, post-mortem coming soon. We are running MC jobs, at ~6000 jobs level on USATLAS sites.
   * There was a dip in the number of running jobs last Tuesday, due to the network maintenance at BNL Tier1. 
   * The gratia job counts for last week is much higher than previous week, because previous week&#39;s record had BNL gratia report dropped, due to the site config issue at BNL. 
      Thanks to Brian noticing this, it&#39;s fixed now. The old records are not lost, will be re-loaded to gratia to make up the old records. 
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 700K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 700K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 102K jobs per day
         * failed 61K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 95%
   * Work to include ATLAS OSG sites downtime info to the general ATLAS downtime page continues
   * USATLAS T2s are asked to publish their SE information to cern BDII, which is on-going, site admins are checking BDII info and will enable the interop BDII option on OIM soon. Some T2 sites will need to register their SE storage as a separate OSG resource, instead of combining both CE and SE into one resource registration. 
 


---++ LIGO (Britta)

   * osg storage discovery tool 0.9 issue: can&#39;t load cache, who to contact? GOC ticket?
      *  Loading cache /home/bdaudert/downloads/osg-discovery-0.9/cache/bdii.xml
         Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: gov/fnal/xpathsearch/cache/XPathCacheLoad
   * Resource such as UNL have been very busy. Also evicted more often than usual on Nemo. They could add about one site a day, but the day would be devoted to it. Chander thinks Britta should talk with FNAL (cmsosgce3) about running email has been exchanged between Chander and Robert.
