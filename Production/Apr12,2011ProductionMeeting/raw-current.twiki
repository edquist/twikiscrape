-- Main.DanFraser - 08 Apr 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * BDII services have moved outside of the UI firewalls. Immediate network improvements were noted as in the charts below. These improvements are so significant that a third BDII may not be needed. However, the third BDII, IS4, was placed into round robin today. So far there have not been any seg faults. 
   * Robert E. drained the E@H queue and has been upgrading the LIGO E@H version to 1.5. This is the reason for the large dropoffs in E@H jobs for the last two weeks. It is up and running again now.
   * SAM data consumer at CERN was down over the weekend. RSV reports have &quot;Unknown&quot; status on Sunday. Data has been resent.
   * Periodic outages in the GridFTP RSV probes at a handful of sites were reported. This has been traced to periodic running of Pigeon tests. Corrected data will need to be resent to the WLCG. 

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Suchandra, Burt, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Machine: still ramping up ...
   * 434 khr/day, 93% success

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * No collisions for physics and data taking during the last week. LHC is working to increase number of bunches and improve beam conditions.
      * US ATLAS production was running reprocessing of cosmic ray data last week, which was completed late Sunday. Now running fast reprocessing of 2011 data and new MC11 simulation jobs. Production is back to the normal level of 10-12k running jobs.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 82%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 776K managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 111K jobs per day
         * failed 57K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 93%, walltime - 95%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues

      * State Optional in OIM
      * !MyOSG / Gip Validator Consolidator
      * Made changes to the top level wlcg bdii monitor script so that BDII entries are loaded one at a time instead of all at once in order to prevent timeout issue caused during low throughput events of IU network.
   * Gratia and !ReSS 
      * Running Site RSV Collector monitoring ReSS and other Fermigrid Services   
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * New Frontend Status
         * Engage (Steven Cox - RENCI) - Completed frontend installation and registered with factory to submit to 24 sites.  Test jobs have run successfully.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-12th.html][Release notes]]
   * All services to be moved outside IU institutional firewall.
      * Testing has proven that the institutional firewall substantially slows service. [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/NDT_perf.jpg][The results]]
      * Results to CERN today since 9AM EDT and 11AM EDT Respectively &lt;br&gt;

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.19
      *       84 (-2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      16 are 1.2.19)
      *        3 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        0 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Announcements: Anand is traveling to a Data conference for NCSA on Th-Fr. Barlow is back from his trips. Mine is at globusworld M-Tu
   * Vulnerabilities/Bug/Incidents:
      * We did not have any important vulnerabilities or incidents. 
      * glexec vulnerability report is written. 
      * bug reported in ca-cert-expiry probe. Evaluating the vulnerability/bug. 
   * Production test of new cert layout is going on. We continue to hold separate meetings. 
   * Started making a plan on security test and controls. The controls and tests are meant to measure and evaluate the security of the osg run services and assets. These are done yearly and they are described in the OSG Security Plan. They cover all services run by OSG. The plan is the highest priority work item. The plan summarizes which security controls will be executed, which area leads (other than security) will contribute, how much work is estimated from all parties. I will work on this with Chander to coordinate and plan across different areas. 
   * Working on the big-picture security plan that shows the security processes lifecycle. The document meant to map our activities against the security lifecycle.
