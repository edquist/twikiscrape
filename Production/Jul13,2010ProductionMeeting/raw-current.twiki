---+++ GLUE-X
   * Discussions moving forward between Richard and Jefferson lab computing division. 
      * Got help from OSG Security.
      * Working on firewall matters and open port ranges. 
      * Feedback: Is there a centralized document in OSG that lists all the supported CAs? 
         * In discussions with Doug O, Robert E. More details with Marco. 

---+++ SBGrid
   * Running well with !GlideInWMS. Doing some CPU reconfiguration to optimize stability and have a better production environment. 
   * Peter and Derek corroborated that Condor 7.5.3 has improved scalability; no problems noticed.
   * Important GLExec Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8845. 
      * This should not have significant impact on SBGrid.

---+++ GEANT4
   * GEANT4 biannual regression-testing validation runs:
      * Successfully running validation jobs for regression-testing of GEANT4 Toolkit&#39;s new release. 
      * Will do this now, then again in December. Nearly 20 sites running on OSG. 
      * Using Engage&#39;s !MatchMaker. 
         * For this particular release, seeing errors connected to libc and other factors. 
   * Abhishek has been in contact with GEANT4 spokesperson. 
   * Gabriele has asked Abhishek to explore possibility of GEANT4&#39;s adding more effort at CERN (or Fermilab) for the December run.
