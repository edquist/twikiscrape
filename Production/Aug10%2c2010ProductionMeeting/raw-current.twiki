---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * There was a BDII outage on Tuesday morning for about 45 minutes as a result of applying the LDAP security patch that caused the BDIIs to stop reporting. Two key problems were identified: 
      * 1) The BDII system update process did not have a complete test procedure in place to ensure that the BDII is reporting properly prior to modifying the other BDII system. Action: Create a punch list for testing a BDII system to  ensure everything is working properly and have it reviewed by CMS and Atlas. (Rob, Burt)
      * 2) The version of the BDII in the ITB is not the same as that in production due to system freezing at production level operations. Rob has raised this issue previously on the operations calls. A plan to determine how best to resolve this is underway. (Dan, Rob)
   * It was also noted that queries on the IS1 BDII are experiencing sporadic delays when the system is under heavy load. This is currently under priority investigation. (Rob)
   * Burt noted that the CMS Tier1 will be handling a series of high-demand workflows for the next several weeks and will be pre-emptiing and throttling jobs from opportunistic VOs. Dan to send a note to the VO team to inform the VOs so they have proper expectations. (Burt, Dan)
   * When Doug and Mine were both away on vacation, a deputy RA was not assigned to take Doug&#39;s role and at least one cert request was delayed by two weeks. Mine has updated the leave-vacation process.

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Burt, Rob Q., Mine, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt) 
   * Last week&#39;s usage: 179 khour/day, 91% success
   * We were affected by this morning&#39;s OSG BDII outage -- how are we moving forward?
   * Lots of high-demand short job workflows on the way (due somewhat to WMAgent testing); the CMS Tier 1 may temporarily become less friendly to opportunistic jobs for a week or two.  Expect job throttles, manual preemptions and the like.
   * LHC milestone: delivered 1 inverse picobarn.  999 more to go!

      * Compares to 36 hours run time without glidein (Test run performed a few month back)
      * LIGO priority at Firefly?

Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.11

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * No major production issues this week.

   * Busy wrapping up the annual cycle of stakeholder planning documents. Input received from: ALICE, CDF, CIGI, D0, !DayaBay, DES, DOSAR, Fermilab VO &amp; subVOs, GEANT4, GPN, !GridUNESP, GROW, HCC, !IceCube, JDEM, OSG-VO&#39;s CHARMM Group, !NanoHUB, NYSGrid, SBGrid.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * We will start testing CILogon CA (A Shibboleth based CA) with OSG users. We identified Clemson university as the candidate. Clemson has the Shib framework installed an running on campus. We will contact OSG contact and users at Clemson whether they want to try and test this new CA. 
   * We are ready to start hosting the new certificate request web page at GOC. We like this to be finished in the next two weeks. We understand all technical details have been worked out. 
   * We identified a problem in our processes. When Doug left for a two week vacation, he forgot to assign a deputy RA. this resulted in some certificates being issued with a twi week&#39;s delay. We added this into our leave-vacation process.
