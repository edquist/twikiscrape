---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

Opportunistic usage of the osg VO continue to average 250K hours per day.

We are reviewing the usage of the OSG-XD submit host for spawning new jobs; we need to limit the local resources that are consumed by users.  Still need to develop a solution plan.

OSG display may have a problem; the CPU hours used in the last 12 months (right pane) are not updating?

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Another incident at XSEDE/TACC. One OSG user is affected, but had no certs in the account. We need to be extra careful with our systems that accepts ssh. 
   * Operations
      * We are switching teh certificate bundle layout at the next CA bundle update. We have been supporting the old layout for a period of time to give our sites time to make the transition, but we reached the end of this period. Only Dosar and Dayabay VOs are expected to be affected. 
      * OSG IdP is moving into production. The initial approvals were obtained. 
      * Problems with users not renewing their VO AUPS. There are problems with suspended and expired users. the grace period will be increased to 30 days.
