-- Main.DanFraser - 08 Mar 2012
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * This is the second time in a couple of weeks that the San Diego Glidein-WMS factory was brought to a halt due to a software upgrade and needed to be rolled back. We need to find a way to better test these updates before incorporating them into a production service. Next step is to discuss further with Igor et al. 
   *  CMS Tier-2&#39;s are showing up as unavailable on the WLCG metrics. The issues are understood and being worked on by CMS. The scenario arose after a CMS TIer-2 switch from GLite to an EMI based distribution. Currently this affects all of the sites using the RPM based version of OSG s/w which is based on GT5 and other CMS sites as well. (Tony)
   * Next week we will be at the OSG AHM meeting and will not have a separate production call.

      * Gratia report: 1.5M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 84%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 730K

   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Small ITB Release - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-march-13-at.html][Notification]]
      * Add JIRA and XSEDE Front-End to Monitoring
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * No changes or incidents last week on OSG Services
      * WSDL of ServiceNow changed last week.

   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded UCSD factory to use condor 7.6.6 as well as updated condor sent with glideins to 7.6.6.
         * Factory condor upgrade created huge load issues so we had to revert back to 7.6.2.  We contacted the Condor Team to help us investigate what happened.
         * We will continue to ship Condor 7.6.6 with glideins as we saw no problems there.  Our load issue is Condor-G related only.
         * Last week we started trying to reproduce load problem with ITB Factory but haven&#39;t been able to yet.  We will continue trying this week.
      * Added T3 support to CERN Factory; it now submits to all T3 sites we currently support at UCSD and GOC.
      * Enabled auto detection of gt5 sites in UCSD factory since sites are beginning to upgrade with OSG Release 3 rpms (This is already set at GOC since it is default behavior).

---+++ Gratia Review
   


---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * CMS had a successful test of HTPC at Purdue and had as many as 70 jobs running simultaneously. 
   * We are actively beta testing BOSCO v0 and the results are being incorporated into the package (both s/w as well as documentation) as they are received.
   * Alain reported the first results of Usability testing with an intelligent but non-expert user. There were a number of surprising and helpful insights that came out of this. This is a very valuable exercise and some of the results have already been incorporated into the package. 

---++ Engage (Mats)

7 users utilized 39 sites;

 90596 jobs total (59425 / 31171 = 65.6% success);

  365166.7 wall clock hours total (220143.4 / 145023.3 = 60.3% success);

---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)
   * Working on testing several components
      * BOSCO
      * lcmaps
   * SL6 CE release after AHM
 
---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.28
      *       78 (-6) OSG 1.2.X resources (       7 are 1.2.28)
      *        1 (-1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *       16 (5) OSG 3.0 (latest: !GridUNESP_CENTRAL, OUHEP_ITB, !RENCI-Blueberry, SPRACE, !UConn-OSG_CE, !UFlorida-PG, Vanderbilt, !Vanderbilt_CE2, Firefly-3)
Problems with sites:
   * Dependency problem between OSG WN and LFC library
   * Problem with Globus requiring !IPv6: 
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-524
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallComputeElement#8_1_Address_family_not_supported	


---++ User Support (Chander)
   * OSG-XSEDE Submit host ready for friendly user testing; [[http://osg-xsede.grid.iu.edu/vofrontend/monitor/frontendStatus.html][see front-end status]]
   * 3 XSEDE allocation requests re-directed toward OSG at last XRAC meeting
   * Load volume testing of system has started
   * Probably need to negotiate acceptance of VO=osg at more sites and enable gfactory for those sites.


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Incidents/Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * No major vulnerabilities. A kernel vulnerability exists but only affects v6. So no announcement is needed. 
      * Worked on our threshold for making announcements and releases. For non-VDT software (OS and others) we will only make an announcement, if it is an important security vulnerability. For VDT components, we will continue to make an evaluation case-case. If it is less than moderate, we will keep it for next release cycle. 
   * Updating the CA release process. Last item was to update the software.grid.iu.edu. and put a link to security team&#39;s documentation. Completed. Announcement to sites to make the switch will be sent in 24 hours. 


   * AHM preparation. 
      * SSH security attack demo at AHM. we will demo a ssh attack in training session and perform commands/actions a site admin should take after the attack. This will include the best practices to secure ssh access. 
      * We will summarize lessons learned from past incidents. 

   * Incident drill plan first draft is ready. We are emailing selected sites this week. If they come to AHM, we will explain face-face. Otherwise, we will explain the drill over emails and phone. 

   * Working on JIRA ticket 547.  Issues with get-cert script. this ticket represents the Long term fix needed
