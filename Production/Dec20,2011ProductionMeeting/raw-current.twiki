---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * The Atlas Tier-1 is planning to upgrade one of its CEs to use the new RPMs in the first week of next year (Xin)
   * The CMS Tier-1 is planning to upgrade the opportunistic CE to RPMs sometime in Q1 next year. Tony will ask Burt to see if this can be done on the sooner side in case any problems are discovered.
   * The GOC is still trying to understand why the BDII v5&#39;s failed when placed into production. A RCA is in progress. (Rob)
   * There will be no service changes at the GOC until late Jan due to the holidays.
   * No Production meeting until Jan 4. Happy Holidays!

   * Job statistics for last week
      * 12,893 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~596 TB/day


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * US ATLAS production during the week was at the average level of ~10K running jobs. Significant drop in production over the weekend due to panda configuration problem during the replacement of the faulty hardware at CERN, which itself created problem with new pilots. 
      * Ongoing reprocessing of the heavy ion data. Also computing resources will be heavily used over the holiday period for urgent simulations, so management asked sites for limited downtimes.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 82%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300~500TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.
   * Issues

   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Main GRATIA-OSG-PROD collector finished upgrade on Friday but we are still on temporary collector,
      will begin process of migrating service ip&#39;s and data collected in the past week back to main collector today.
      Anything that didn&#39;t change its database pointers to point at fermicloud339.fnal.gov temporarily
     (display.grid.iu.edu, gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu) didn&#39;t get data.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Registered new frontend ATLASDE for ATLAS VO (Rodney Walker)
      * Worked with Jonathan at RENCI in getting Engage glidein submission working on new resource RENCI-Blueberry
      * Set up SBGrid glidein submission for site HMS-Orchestra-Dev; this is our first OSG site running Debian that we officially support now in the glidein factory.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * No changes planned for this or next week for IU Based Services
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Will complete migration of gratia back to original collector, plus upgrade 3 smaller collectors
       (transfer, daily, ITB).

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.25
      *       91 (1) OSG 1.2.X resources (      23 are 1.2.25)
