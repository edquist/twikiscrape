---++ Security
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents:
      * New vulnerability has been reported regarding Linux kernel privilege escalation. We received report from EGI: https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2016-5195 It consists on a race condition found in the way the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. It is referred as DirtyCOW. By exploiting this vulnerability, an unprivileged local user could gain access to read-only memory mappings and increase her privileges on the system. RedHat has not published security updates for affected OS versions yet. The CVE report appears as ongoing work.
         * RedHat has published security update for:
            * RHEL 7: [[http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2098.html][http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2098.html]]
            * RHEL 6: [[http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2105.html][http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2105.html]]
   * Started OSG Risk Assessment for 2016. Service owners have been contacted through email asking for filling surveys to evaluate security controls intended to guarantee Data Integrity in OSG.
   * Emails from OSG Operations Center are being flagged by FNAL Microsoft mail server. Working with Kyle to find the cause.

---++ Communication (Kyle)
   * Documentation Meetings happened last week in Indianapolis. !TimC visited.
      * Paths forward mapped out; Documentation types were categorized
      * Robots.txt was updated to block off indexing of Production, !SoftwareTeam, !ReleaseDocumentation, !TWiki (~2000 documents)
      * Archival of webs has resulted in around 3,000 documents being taken off the twiki
         * 35% of original content has been pruned or robot.txted.
