---++ Security
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Vulnerability reported in Linux kernel: A &#39;use after free&#39; vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow a local root exploit and potentially also remote arbitrary code execution. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31838
      * OpenSSL published new release that fixes some vulnerabilities; one rated as High: TLS connections using a specific set of ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS. 
         * This does *NOT* affect Red Hat systems
         * No current Linux distributions include OpenSSL 1.1.0 yet, so only systems with custom/manual installations of OpenSSL 1.1.0 are impacted.
   * OSG mailing lists were failing due to configuration issues at FNAL Exchange mail server.
   * Some surveys for Risk Assessment 2016 are still pending.

---++ Communication (Kyle)

   * HPCwire Top Supercomputing Achievement Award: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/hpcwire
   * OSG Mailing list failures this morning - Resolved after FNAL ticket
