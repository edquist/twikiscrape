---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/9oh5bzh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Problems with maintenance:
      * 3 VM hosts did not boot after maintenance, problem solved by removing un-needed services and restarting. Running smoothly now.
      * All issues resolved within announced maintenance window.
      * Approximately 3 hours after work completed on is2 (Indianapolis BDII instance) a large asymmetry between the two instances was observed. This was coincident with problems with network in the IUPUI machine room. Machine was removed from DNS RR and restarted. Asymmetry returned to normal and remains there. A critical RSV metric has been created to monitor this quantity. No service interruption occurred. 
   * Last production release this year. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-goc-service.html][Release note]]
      * OS updates, expect reboots
      * Installed capacity report updated
      * Internal changes to ticket
      * Changes to OIM and !MyOSG to support OASIS
   * OASIS up with limited disk space. Known problem with known solution.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Gluex Frontend is now registered to both GOC and SDSC Production factories
      * GOC partition is filling with glidein logs due to increased CMS usage
         * To deal with short term we manually cleaned up as much as possible - this only brought us below 90% temporarily.
         * Requested GOC to provide larger SSD for long term solution

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
OSG 1.2 deprecation banner is in place.
This is not changing any policy, just making them more visible.

Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.12 / 1.2.31
      *       59 (1) OSG 3.x (      10 are 3.1.12)
      *       41 (-1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       0 are 1.2.31)
