      * This won&#39;t last long, work expected to pick up soon

---++ Attendees: Tony, Tim C, Tim T, Xin, Chander, Scott

---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 13,059 jobs/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not stable, started at the average level of 35K running jobs a week ago and gradually reduced to the level of 10K last couple of days. The reason was general not enough job load .
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.7 M jobs, 5.0M walltime hours, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 86%. 
      * 1.5 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate was between 100~450TB/day, average at ~350TB/day, at BNL Tier1, for last week

   * GOC
      * ITB release, Release note in progress.
      * Gratiaweb difficulties continue. Currently running only one instance, updating once per day.
         * Configured to determine the location of the problem. (or show it is elsewhere)
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * The DocDB software will be upgraded to fix bugs and a few cosmetic changes will be made to the &quot;Document Update&quot; form. Switching software releases takes less than a second. It is unlikely that you or your users will notice any downtime. Thursday, September 18; 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
Due to a recent drop in usage by ATLAS and CMS, the OSG VO has been able to validate the new submit node at &gt;500K hours per day (&gt;20K cores) over the last couple of days.  Yesterday we acheived 571K hours and today looks like it will also exceed 500K hours.  The new hardware complex plus the optimization work done by Mats on the file system seems to be performing well and I believe our design goals for the new submit node are likely achieved (but we do want to observe performance for another 2-4 weeks to develop confidence).
