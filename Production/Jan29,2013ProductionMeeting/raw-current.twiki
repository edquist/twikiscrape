---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.13 / 1.2.31
      *       63 (0) OSG 3.x (       0 are 3.1.13)
      *       39 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       3 are 1.2.31)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents/Emergencies
      * Incident at XSEDE found to have no affects on OSG
      * Tested 60 gatekeeeprs against high-level condor vulnerabilities. Originally found 14 sites to be vulnerable. Now we have 3 sites remaining. We could not run our tests on 40+ sites for various reasons. We are trying to get our tests run on these sites
   * Operations
      * Pakiti made it into software release. Next steps are to raise site admins awareness of this tool. We plan for training sessions at AHM. 
      * Traceability requirements document is near completion. The new requirements allow sites to run grid jobs without any end user certificate as long as the VO meet the traceability requirements. Fermilab security officer is reviewing the requirements and already gave a feedback over the first draft. V2 is completed and sent to Fermilab security team. Once Fermilab accepts these requirements this will open the door for VOs to run jobs without certificates over Fermilab grid resources. 
      * New problems concerning Digicert certs are found. Dave Dykstra and others are working on the issues. If a worker node uses a host cert proxy (not the real host cert), connection to GUMS fails. This also impacts the case where worker node has no certificates at all and uses the pilot proxy to connect to the GUMS. This is an important issue becuase cms sites were getting ready to upgrade to latest gums/glexec and stop having certificates on worker nodes.
