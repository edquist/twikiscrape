Investigating why we are not running opportunistically at BNL sites; awaiting response from John Hover.

Enabled NWChem group to use OSG; for details see https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/project?id=52

Working to enabled a student at SIU on OSG who is pursuing Ph.D. in Zoology; this is a migration from the Engage VO.

Planning to move !BakerLab (U-Washington) flocking from UCSD to OSG-XD in the next few weeks.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * False incident report from UFL. Thought it was under a syn flood attack. turned out that the jobs were legitimate jobs, but for some reason they were all targeting the same port and causing memory exhaustion. 
      * Perfsonar security. Should we do anything for securing perfsonar boxes at sites? do we have any responsibility over this or is this completely outside of OSG&#39;s responsibility? 
   * Operations
      * Changes planned with Oasis server at GOC. Reviewing the plans from security perspective
      * Glow VO audit is started for submitting certificate-free jobs
      * New CA package coming out soon.
