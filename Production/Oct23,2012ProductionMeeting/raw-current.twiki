-- Main.DanFraser - 09 Oct 2012
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * The CMS Tier-1 was down for ~8 hours yesterday (Oct 22) due to a sudden power failure related to power maintenance. They are still investigating the root cause. (Tony)
   * Discussed the issue of non-OSG users (who have non-OSG credentials stored in their browser) getting annoying browser requests for certificates. Currently &quot;http:&quot; pages are automatically redirected to &quot;https://&quot;. Rob is looking into the possibility of keeping the http channel open.
   * Xin is confirming within Atlas whether they can move ahead and recommend the RPM based upgrades to the sites. Dan will hold off on sending the Pacman EOL notification to OSG-sites until he hears back from Xin.

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Brian, Tim, Suchandra, Tony, Marco, Rob Q., Mine, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 18,953 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~647 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * After the machine development period LHC came back with very stable operation during the last week and collected luminosity for the week was 1.14fb-1. Current total collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~16.8 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was generally stable, at the average level around 20-22K running jobs. Reprocessing of the Express Stream was carried out over the week, with preparation for bulk reprocessing. There was some drop in the production level over the weekend, when reprocessing finished, and there was a delay with new task submissions. Monday the production was back to normal.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 88%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 350~550TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues

      * Should discuss gums template format and content
   * Trying to arrange VOMS testing

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.10 / 1.2.30
      *       51 (0) OSG 3.x (      11 are 3.1.10)
      *       52 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       3 are 1.2.30)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        0 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
Almost all sites updated the CA certificates (except UCD, HEPGRID_UERJ). There have been some update glitches that we are still investigating (RENCI-Blueberry, FIUPG).
Here the updated status: [[http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr3.php?gridtype=osg&amp;style=rsv-cacheck.xsl]]



---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * High level condor vulnerability. Draft is being sent to OSG sites. OSG distributed rpms of Condor is not vulnerable. glideinwms worker nodes are not vulnerable. only sites who supports standard universe jobs are vulnerable. Announcement will include how to identify if a site is vulnerable and what to do. 
   * Operational issues
      * PKI training is going on. Last GridAdmin training session is on this Friday. 
      * CILogon Basic CA
         * Accepting the Basic CA for access to OSG &quot;IT&quot; services. Will help OSG &quot;lightweight&quot; users who only uses their certs to access OSG IT services (docdb, twiki, myosg, oim) Fermilab docdb already accepted and made the technical work necessary to accept these certs. GOC is also on board and will complete the changes. 
         * Glow VO is the first VO who is switching their users to CIlogon Basic CA. GLOW VOMS is now configured to use CIlogon Basic CA. VOMS Admins are aware of the changes to VO registration process. 
         * Contacted sites who provides cycles to Glow and asked them to accept CIlogon Basic. Entire Nebraska sites already accepts CIlogon Basic. Sprace just agreed to accept and made the change. MWT2 and UConn are reviewing the CA.  Contacted Purdue , have not heard any answers yet. 
      * CMS reported a problem with the new CA bundle, but turned out to be a non-issue. We could not re-generate the error and everything is working
