   * [[%ATTACHURL%/Site-VO_matrix-Nov_2016.xlsx][Site-VO_matrix-Nov_2016.xlsx]]: Site-VO matrix for November 2016
      * Overall hours (all VOs, all sites) up 2% in Nov to 117.9M
      * !OSG VO hours nearly flat, 8.26M vs. 8.28M in October
      * !ATLAS was up 2M hours overall; took a bite out of opportunistic availability at AGLT2 and MWT2.
      * 1.3M fewer hours at Syracuse for GLOW+HCC+OSG+SBgrid: combination of partial transition to SL7 and pressure from campus users?
      * Nice increase at Stanford in total hours
   * !NOvA problems at !JINR thought to be from outdated lcmaps verify plugin. Site is disabled in production until their upcoming software upgrade is done.
