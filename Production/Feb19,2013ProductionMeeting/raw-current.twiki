---++ Integration (Suchandra)

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.14 / 1.2.31
      *       66 (2) OSG 3.x (       13 are 3.1.14)
      *       37 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       2 are 1.2.31)
Status of OSG 3 upgrade:
   * CMS: 2 Tier-2 missing and will upgrade soon. Fermilab is upgrading WN clients, then they will upgrade (around the end of the month). Some Tier-3s have still OSG 1.2
   * ATLAS: one gatekeeper at BNL and a couple of Tier-2. Most Tier-3 use only the client.
   * Few other sites with OSG 1.2 from other VOs



---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * New twiki vulnerability reported by Scott T--thanks. Scott also checked that GOC twiki is not vulnerable. 
   * Operations: 
      * OSG Traceability requirement is accepted by OSG Management. It was approved by Fermilab Secrurity team. The next step is to take this document to Fermilab CIO for final approval. Approximately in 2 weeks depending on Lothar&#39;s schedule. 
      * OSG CA. CMS is mostly ready for the transition. Some minor issues. Tier2 and tier3s are monitored closely for necessary gums glexec updates. Atlas is ready for the transition as well. All atlas tier2 have already upgraded or have plans to upgrade. Fermilab worker nodes are in the middle of upgrading gums and glexec updates. 
      * OSG CA. DigiCert sent an auditing questionnaire for our new PKI. this is the next item on my list. 
      * Oasis/cvmfs security assessment. Scott T agreed to implement the requested security actions. What we need is to understand GOC&#39;s plan and the timeline to resolve these issues. 
      * SHA-2 transition. Should start sending reminders to sites about upgrading their software for sha-2 compatibility. we have time until august but it will go by fast,
