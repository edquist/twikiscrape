---+++ Operations This Week
   * We have ATLAS sign-off on BDII v5. Pending CMS sign-off  we will change is.grid to only IUB instances during 1st November production change window.
      * Tony reports testing has gone well so far, but needs more time before giving the official CMS stamp of approval. 
   * Replacement for !GridView/RSV comparison nearly complete. Will start sending test reports from new version soon.
   * New VO Package Released. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-vo-package-lbne-grow-and-glow.html][Notification]]
   * ITB release done smoothly.
      * OS updates on ITB machines. Reboots may be required.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.23
      *      100 (-2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      11 are 1.2.23)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * A security incident at CERN. Announcement is sent out. No affects on OSG.
   * No new vulnerabilities. Past two vulnerabilities (when I was gone) have been discussed with GOC staff. Turns out non issues for GOC servers
   * WLCG/CERN/TeraGrid and XSEDE Security Officers are visiting FNAL this week for a security workshop. Any security policy requests/discussions you like us to have, please let me know. 
      * I will discuss our changing risk models and recent threats. I want to use Bitcoin attacks and kernel.org compromise as case studies. 
   * No other production issues.
