-- Main.DanFraser - 11 Nov 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * On Dec 13, the GOC will put two BDII v5&#39;s into round robin in parallel with the two BDII v4&#39;s. (Rob)
   * Also Dec 13 is the planned limited release date for the OSG-CE. It is important to let sys admins know that this is coming soon and to be ready to plan for upgrades to OSG 3 (RPM based). Tony will mention this at the upcoming CMS T2 meeting. Alain to contact Rob G. about making the Atlas T2 community aware.
   * It is not clear yet, but there may be an issue with data transfer reporting from the Atlas T1. Xin noted that internally, the data transfers are about the same for the past month or so, while for the past two weeks, following an updated RSV probe, and some other changes, the gratia report is much lower. Xin to explore this further.

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Alain, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 11,245  jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~370 TB/day


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * Good progress with Heavy Ion collisions program this week, with collected luminosity doubled. The last day of run is Dec.7. After that technical stop until March 7, 2012. Discussions about 2012 LHC setup. ATLAS request to increase energy to 4TeV/beam (vs 3.5TeV now), and keep bunch spacing at 50ns (vs projected 25ns). This will give more luminosity, higher cross sections for the physics processes, but also more pileup, and all simulation has to be redone for 2x4TeV.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was overall stable, at the average level of ~12K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs.  
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: no weekly summary report received this week.  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was ~100T/day at BNL T1 in last week.
   * Issues

      * 82171.0 wall clock hours total (57292.8 / 24878.2 = 69.7% success)

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR

      * Monitoring progress, no issues

---+++ OSG-ITB Testing
   * Waiting for login issue at local submit host to be resolved
   * Planning to pre-stage data to UC_ITB, FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB 
      * Can&#39;t authenticate againts UC_ITB - notified Suchandra
      * FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB down
   * Suchandra will check if other ITB sites have enough space to run (meaningful) Pulsar  test work-flow

     * Waiting for information from other resources
   * ITB RPM testing
      * VO validation
         * Dzero signoff
         * ATLAS hammercloud testing running at BNL, working on getting it running at UC
         * Getting things ready for other VO tests
      * OSG 3.0.3 release for client, wn-client, and glexec 

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.25
      *       94 (-4) OSG 1.2.X resources (      22 are 1.2.25)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6) - CNIC-OSG, rutgers-cms (and expired: NYSGRID-CUNY-GRID, SBGrid-Harvard-Exp)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources - NERSC-Franklin, STAR-WSU
      *        4 (-1) Resources listing RPMs (OSG 3?)


---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)

   * Vulnerabilities/Attacks: New security compromise at an EGI site. No affects found on OSG sites. Announcement will shortly follow. 

   * A communication interface to software security contacts is being added to GOC announcement tool. 
   * ITB tests
      * Need to organize the tests for DOEGrids CA updates. This update is important to keep operations going. Working with Alain and Suchandra to schedule tests
      * DigiCert pilot tests. still going on in ITB. We need to hear from FNAL-CMS (Tony), FermiGrid (Steve Timm) about test results. Suchandra has gotten most tests done. 
      * Having multiple tests planned at ITB regarding CAs is an issue. We have limited resources and ITB admins who can conduct multiple tests. We are working with ITB/VDT to schedule them in most suitable way without being late on updates.
