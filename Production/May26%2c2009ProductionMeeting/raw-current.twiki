---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.18M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 84.7%
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 445,710 managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs
         * average  ~62,244 jobs per day
         * failed   161,607  jobs
         * average efficiency: 72.9% for jobs and 91.3% for walltime
         * Huge number of job failures due to ABORTED tasks and high statistics (event/run#) issue.

   * D0 
      * D0 MC production is at an average consumption of 120,000 wall hours per day, at usual efficiencies. 
      * D0 Event production is at 9.2 million events per week. (Peak rate of 12.3 million events per week, in first week of May &#39;09). 
      * Related to OSG, partial bugfix for Globus LSF Manager is now in place. Deployed at OU. URLs - https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=6489 and http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6688

   * Encouragement extended to all inactive at-large VOs to expedite the ramp up phase, or ask for assistance from OSG, or be officially marked as temporarily inactive.
      * VOs marked blue or gray at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/AtLargeForum
   
   * !CompBioGrid
      * Blog now ready - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/CompBioGrid_OSG
      * VO-group, GOC, Sites groups to help prioritize.
      
   * VORS deprecation
      * Known dependents on VORS are !FermiGrid/Fermilab-VO, NYSGrid, SBGrid, STAR. 
      * Document from Rob/GOC to be forwarded to at-large VOs.
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/GettingResourceDataMyOSG

   * nanoHUB [carryover items]
      * Wider-scope items within OSG are in need of discussion:
         * Need for more accurate site advertisement of only the supported VOs.
         * Accuracy in GIP design to advertise memory and architecture of a heterogeneous site.
         * Measures to publish site policies on preemption, suspension, eviction.
         * Gratia Accounting system to possibly capture application level exit codes.
         * Gratia Accounting system to possibly capture different job streams or categories. E.g., using DNs.
         * OSG Metrics system, to possibly generate different graphical views of different exit codes, and for different applications.
      * Pending out-of-taskforce-scope OSG Enhancements
         * Multi-gatekeeper handling: Difficulty to evaluate status of a site with multiple gatekeepers on the same cluster. There is a need to advertise gk1 OR gk1 model so that a VO does not erroneously evaluate such a site using gk1 AND gk2 as the usual logic.
         * Interruption in service and impact of change in CA certificate distribution mechanism: CAs in use by nanoHUB are not regular DOECA, thus nanoHUB was affected by the procedural change. A fraction of OSG sites seem not to have implemented the transition.
