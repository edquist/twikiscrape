-- Main.DanFraser - 08 Feb 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Accounting updates due to errors in the RSV probe 1.2.17 have been submitted and accepted into the WLCG. Rob is still working to ensure that these changes are visible in Gridview.  (Rob, Xin)
   * A race condition in the RSV WLCG accounting probe was discovered in 1.2.18 that could result in an &quot;unknown&quot; status was discovered. This is being fixed in 1.2.19. It is recommended that WLCG sites wait until this version to upgrade. (Suchandra)
   * The number of slots available for OSG opportunistic use at the Atlas Tier-1 has been changed from 40 to 60. (Xin)
   * We agreed upon HTPC attributes to be added to the config.ini file (htpc; htpc_rsl; htpc_vos; htpc_exclude_queue). Burt will start implementing these in the GIP to allow discovery of HTPC enabled sites.

---++ CMS (Burt)
   * 185 khour/day, 93% success
   * Transitioning to glideinWMS v2.5 (FNAL production factories)

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC beam commissioning period started past Saturday, for 3 weeks. First stable beams with few bunches at mid-March. ATLAS production was relatively stable during the week at the average level of 10-12k running jobs, mainly simulation jobs.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.5M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 221K jobs per day
         * failed 76K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 95%, walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * RSV issues in the new OSG release caused lower WLCG availability and reliability for BNL T1. Rolled back to previous OSG release. Needs help from GOC to correct the RSV numbers for the last several days, before WLCG report is out for the month. 
      * Downtime info was resent by GOC to WLCG, to correct the WLCG site availability report for last month, need confirmation from WLCG for the correction.  
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : job quota is in place for OSG jobs, with fixed upper limit. Right now the upper limit is 60.
