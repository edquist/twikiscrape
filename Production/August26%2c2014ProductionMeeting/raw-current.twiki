---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

The new XD-login host is operational and users are being transitioned over; expect to release the old hardware for !iRODS sometime next week.

Boston-U-ATLAS-T2  and MIT-CMS-T2 are now providing opportunistic access; thank you !


---++ Security (Mine)
   *Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * None   
   * Operations
      * Completing the SHA-2 transition. DigiCert is ready to switch to a SHA-2 compliant intermediate CA. We have included this new CA in our CA bundle since April. &quot;Most&quot; of our sites must have installed this new CA by now. We want to complete the change as soon as possible since we are falling behind the IGTF timeline and our promised timeline to DigiCert. There should be no visible impact on the end user. They can cntinue to use their certs and renew their certs. The user cert DN will remain unchanged.
