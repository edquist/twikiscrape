---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.14 / 1.2.31
      *       67 (1) OSG 3.x (      15 are 3.1.14)
      *       37 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       2 are 1.2.31)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

   * Cherenkov Telescope Array US collaboration has approached user support; we think this is just for getting certificates but we are investigating.

   * LHC Theory group (referred by Lothar) are being enabled under the osg vo as group=snowmass; they will be doing simulations

   * OSG-XSEDE usage has fallen off dramatically; we assume due to researchers looking at their results and getting ready for the next round of computations

   * A couple of queries in Gratia Web (right pane) do not appear to work or produce results that are in reasonable range; the project manager has asked production to investigate.  It seems our testing process did not catch these issues in ITB before official release.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * None
   * Operations
      * PKI Transition. 
         * CMS and Atlas on track. CMS had a email signing problem for the members of CMS certificate team. The problem was solved by either using CERN email accounts or OSG CA certs. 
         * OSG-Digicert Audit is completed.  
      * OSG Traceability requirements for jobs without user certificates. I circulated the document to area coordinators and asked help from Glideinwms developers to review it. I need help understand which requirements can be satisfied and which requirements need further work. I need to have a understanding before taking this to FNAL security board.  
      * CVMFS/Oasis security review. Waiting to hear back from GOC about their plans to implement the security recommendations.
