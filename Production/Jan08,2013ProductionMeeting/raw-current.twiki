---++ CMS (Tony)

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC is in recommissioning stage (Jan.7-17) in preparation for the heavy ion run. The run itself is planned for Jan.18-Feb.11 morning. Two day LHC tests are planned after that, and then Long Shutdown.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was stable, at the average level around 20-24K running jobs, mixture of simulation and group production after the reprocessing.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.2M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 85%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 0.9 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 350TB/day at BNL T1.

   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * An incident at a partner grid. A user who has access to OSG is also compromised. No effect is expected and found on OSG. 
      * Condor vulnerability. 2 important vulnerability. Found 14 sites affected. 9 of them responded and either patched, upgraded or applied a workaround. We still have 5 sites that responded and talked about their plans/thoughts, but took no action. 

   * Operations
      * SHA-2 tests. Got the new SHA-2 certs form DOEgrids CA. it has the new cert for DOEgrids CA, CRLs, end user and service certs. Tests went well. All software in ITB that is tested so far was successful. Suchandra is still testing some components that are not contained in ITB. My goal is to repeat these tests with DigiCert CA test certificates. It may be at a later date due to the OSG PKI transition. 
      * Issues with OSG CA release process. Discovered the issues while doing the SHA-2 tests. Met with software team and revised the release process and made changes as we all agreed between the two teams. The new process will be used from this point onward. 
      *  CILogon Basic CA certs tested with GOC IT Production OIM, ticket, and myosg services. They all worked. It seems like GOC IT services moved onto recognize CILogon Basic CA certs in production.
