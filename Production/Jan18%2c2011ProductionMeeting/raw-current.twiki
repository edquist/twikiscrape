---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * Armen, Britta, Rob Q., Scott T., Marco, Suchandra, Xin, Burt, Robert E.
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Machine: cosmic runs start 1st week of February; pp data taking scheduled for March 1 or so.
   * 322 khour/day, 91% success
   * Over last month, production managed to run nearly 30k concurrent jobs across OSG and EGI

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * ATLAS production was quite stable before the downtime (Sat-Mon) at the average level of 10-12k running jobs. At the moment it ramped up back to the normal level. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.7M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.2M managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 165K jobs per day
         * failed 72K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  94%
      * Downtime of CERN PanDA services and BNL T1 are over, all production services are operational now. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~300TB/day
   * Issues
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : working on that, will try out on RHIC resources first, then expand to ATLAS resources.  &amp;#12288;

---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL

   * Open ticket: NWICG_ NotreDame

   * GLIDEINS
      * Submitted File transfer dag to Harvard-East, two transfer jobs fail with time out error, submitted rescue
      * CIT_CMS_T2 glidin work-flow not starting up, trouble shooting with Mats
      * NoterDame work-flow fails, looks like  /dscratch/osg/bestman may not be mounted on all WNs

   * Tested Pegasus 3.0.1 release

      * Will release in the next day or two

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.16
      *       94 (1) OSG 1.2.X resources (      16 are 1.2.16)
      *        3 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
