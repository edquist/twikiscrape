-- Main.DanFraser - 09 Feb 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * LHC: In commissioning phase.  Beam splash seen; ramp up to collisions at 900 GeV, then up to 7 TeV in a few weeks (Burt, Armen)
   * John Weigand has sent out tickets to several of the sites that are not reporting Gratia data, with some suggestions about how to fix the sites e.g. restart Gratia. All of these worked. Plan to continue with other sites (~14) that are not reporting. (Brian)
   * As Abhishek &amp; Brian noted, the Gratia transition did not go as smoothly as predicted -- there was significant downtime during the change over to the new system. that was noticable by the VOs in their reports. The database is still not caught up. Dan/Rob to discuss with Keith how best to keep the GOC (and others) informed in such situations.
   * As a result of the Gratia change over to the new system, the DOE Display is showing some strange data (long strings of 0&#39;s). Brian is investigating.

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 123 khour/day, 88% success.
   * LHC: In commissioning phase.  Beam splash seen; ramp up to collisions at 900 GeV, then up to 7 TeV in a few weeks.
   * Large global workflows beginning -- start at 50% of T1 and ramp up.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * Production level was low during the week, up and down, overall at the level of 1-3k running jobs, mainly simulation. The reprocessing has been all done without any major problem. Post mortem in two weeks.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 68%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 408K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 58K jobs per day
         * failed 44K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 90%,  walltime - 93%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer is 100~150 TB/day. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage: (from Mark) waiting on a reply from Robert Illingworth to let us know what we need to do to test D0 jobs on our system.

---++ Metrics (Brian)

   * Busy week!  Last week, we had:
      * OSG Display presented to the DOE.
      * Operations switched over Gratia.
      * Just today, we&#39;ve detected some issues on the OSG Display due to the new hardware ... we&#39;ve asked FermiGrid admins to watch things in order to determine if this is a one time event or will reoccur (and hence require some code changes).
   * Continuing consistency work:
      * Info service RSV probe delivered to VDT
      * Been bothering operations weekly to watch the Gratia reports.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * D0
