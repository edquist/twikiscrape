-- Main.DanFraser - 10 Mar 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Burt identified several settings and changes that need to be made to the VDT to make running the T3s easier. These have been passed to Alain and will be brought up as Production/T3 items to the VDT. (Burt, Dan)
   * A third BDII (identical to IS1 and IS2) has been running stably alongside the GOC BDIIs for the past several weeks and will be introduced into the Round Robin next week during the change cycle. (Rob)
   * The HTPC team needs to provide a mechanism for testing sites to see if they have correctly configured HTPC. Several ITB sites will be configured to support HTPC soon. (Suchandra, Dan)
   * The problem with the OSG RSV probes in 1.2.17 noted several weeks ago created more widespread accounting issues in the WLCG reports for BNL than was previously recognized. The GOC team now has the remainder of these corrected and submitted to CERN. Rob will continue to track until Xin can verify their completeness. (Rob, Xin)
   * There was a transient !MyOSG failure early Sunday morning, under investigation [[http://itnotices.iu.edu/list.aspx?day=3%2f13%2f2011][Prime suspect]]. 
      * 3:30AM Failed, 3:31AM OK
      * The alarm system worked correctly. (Rob)

   * Glide In Factory
      * The factory was down from Friday 3/4, 9 pm (PT) to Saturday 3/5, 5 pm due to a SSD failure
         * Upgraded os from RHEL4 to RHEL5 - the replacement SSD was not compatible with the RHEL4 kernel
         * Upgraded to glideinWMS 2.5.1 - we were planning to upgrade anyway, so we did this to minimize total downtime
      * 3/11 - Discovered a bug in the glideinWMS code that may have been causing inefficiencies for some of our VO Frontends
         * GLIDEIN_Max_Walltime was using our default value for 24h instead of what we specify per site entry.
         * Igor patched the code and submitted the patch to glideinWMS

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php

---++ User Support (Chander)
No meeting last week due to OSG-AHM.  SURAGrid is joining as an OSG VO and we will organize needed effort to support this integration.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Testing the new certificate layout in ITB. Anand explained the issue to Suchandra and Dan at AHM. We will test it against older osg versions and also osg packages other than the ce. Europeans made the switch to the new certificates and had a major problem with VOMS-Admin. they had to roll-back. Some of the osg versions we like to test are not in ITB. We wnt to discuss if we can work with a few production sites.
   * Connectivity problems with Japanese CA. Sent out the announcement to sites. RSV probes will fail for CRL updates. This is not a problem for any site. We asked us-atlas management if we should do any more work for affected us-atlas users. We also started a thread of discussion on what to do in cases of CA failures. 
   * Several bug reports and evaluation requests. More important ones: DOEGrids host cert formats. We discovered some host certificates are issued without ssl server capabilities. This is important and we are debugging the problem. The security team cannot re-generate the problem. But apparently it happens to some other gridadmins. 
   * Goc requested an evaluation of ssl renegotiation errors. 
   * Xrootd provider asked recommendation over authentication to be used with xrootd. 
   * glexec vulnerabilities have been reported. Not a major risk.
   * DZero reported an operational problem with GUMS and requested a feature. Relayed to Hover. He has it on its list. 
   * Security controls are going on. 
   * Site security training materials. We gave a security training at the AHM. We sent the materials to the broader community to sites email list.    
   * We heard one operational request during these: security announcements from GOC only reach primary security contacts. We will create a ticket with GOC and see why secondary contacts do not get the announcements. 
   * Important security controls will be resumed in future again. We will start another set of incident drills. We will inform you.    
   * The list of osg versions and sites we want to test for new certificate layout.
