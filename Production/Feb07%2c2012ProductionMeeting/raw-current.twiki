-- Main.BrittaDaudert - 06 Feb 2012

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * OSG reached a new peak last week of over 12.5 M hours (Dan)
      * http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WebHome
   * There was a failure in the ticket attachment exchange system as GGUS upgraded to a new version of Remedy. The system is still down but being worked on. Dan to send a note to Michael Ernst to explore how we may try and create better communication channels (and perhaps an SLA) with the GGUS team. (Rob)
   * There are about 15 OSG sites that are not reporting Gratia data. Rob to draft a note to see if we can help them install or update their Gratia probes. (Rob)
   * PNNL is beginning the process of adding their site to the OSG in support of the Belle VO (Chander)
   * DOE Grids has agreed to provide a feature on their user certificate renewal website (similar to our renewal website) to recommend and make it as easy as pressing a button to upgrade the extended DOEgrids CA cert. (Mine)
   * Forgot to discuss at the meeting but the production, user support, and Wisconsin teams are investigating how to improve GLOW usage on the OSG.

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Brian, Suchandra, Tony, Marco, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan

         * 540K
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was ~200TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues

      * 128256.9 wall clock hours total (95141.0 / 33115.9 = 74.2% success)
   * Previous week&#39;s total usage: 2 users utilized 14 sites
      * 67435 jobs total (25063 / 42372 = 37.2% success)
      * 132839.6 wall clock hours total (109801.4 / 23038.2 = 82.7% success)
---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * Monitoring 50,000 job dag submitted to local glidein factory, running over 13 OSG sites
    
---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
      * Glide In Factory at 97.35%. This is within acceptable SLA Level, but can we do better?
      * Heavy load leads to *CRITICAL* error. Should this be *WARNING*?
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * GGUS ticket exchange attachment feature unavailable until further notice, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/ticket-exchange-attachment-interface.html][Notice]]
   * No release, 5th Tuesday
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * List of VO&#39;s in Gratia reporting has been cut from a peak of 576 down to 190.  Expect to trim 50-60 more after sites (Wisconsin, UFlorida, NERSC) answer outstanding tickets.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, notice to be released tomorrow
      * routine updates to TWiki, !GratiaWeb, Repo, !MyOSG
   * OS updates on ITB machines. _Note non-standard date_
      * _reboots will be required_
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Expect to reboot Gratia and ReSS machines this week for kernel updates, High availability will keep user-facing services available throughout.
   * Saturday and Sunday RSV/SAM Comparison Reports Failed
      * Due to slowness at !MyWLCG
      * This has been corrected and reports are recalculating
   * Chasing down sites that are not reporting to Gratia
      * From ticket [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11551][11551]]

   * 2 releases coming up
      * Pacman (OSG 1.2.27) release
         * biggest update is apache
      * osg ca certs update

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.26
      *       91 (1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.26)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        4 (1) OSG 3.0 - new: OUHEP_ITB
      *        7 (1) Resources listing RPMs (OSG 3?)


---++ User Support (Chander)
   * !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton) is re-establishing their site on OSG.
   * PNNL (Ryan Wright) is beginning the process of setting up a site on OSG as part of Belle VO.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Operations/Vulnerability/Incidents
      * No major vulnerabilities or incidents. Last incident closeout report had been sent to ET
      * Minor/Moderate updates from Openssl-- announcement to the community
   * Users need to re-import the extended DOEgrids CA cert. Change is coomunicated to DOEGrids and accepted. OSG certificate request and renewal page is enhanced to include a mechanism for re-importig the CA cert. DOEgrids will provide a similar feature and renewal notices for the end user
   * Updating the CA release process. Software/Operations and Security teams agreed on a project plan. Security team contacted all the sites hiting GOC rpm. No sites objected to the change.
