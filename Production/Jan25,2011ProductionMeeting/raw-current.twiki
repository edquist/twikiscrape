---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Marcia, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * No update yet on LHC run configuration for this year - the workshop on that this week. ATLAS production was quite stable during the week, at the average level of 10-12k running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. Discussions and operations to optimize data management scheme. At the moment consolidation of space tokens. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * no report from the production team this week, should be fine according to various monitors. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * OSG gratia doesn&#39;t have BNL T1 data transfer rate since Jan 15, the dcache upgrade, due to ongoing space cleanup in dcache billing DB of BNL dcache.  
   * Issues
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : farm group is working on that

   * Next week both ReSS machines physical move, all services will remain available. 
   * Plan on upgrading glideins to Condor 7.5.5 for better CREAM support.
   * Next Monday GRASE VO will be removed. 
   * Problems with NLR caused ~20 Resources to stop reporting to BDII today 10:45AM to 12:35AM EST. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/01/nlr-networking-issue-affects-osg-bdii.html][Notification]].

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.16
      *       95 (1) OSG 1.2.X resources (      16 are 1.2.16)
      *        3 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
