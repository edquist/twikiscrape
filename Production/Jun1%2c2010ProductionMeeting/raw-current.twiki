---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Tony is working on the requirements for enabling an SE in GIP without necessarily having a CE. Meanwhile, Burt has set up a dummy CE for Princeton as a work around.
   * In preparation and gathering results for ICHEP (July 29), it is anticipated that there will be increased usage from Atlas and CMS. CMS has requested that the facility be maintained in as stable of a condition as possible. 
   * Plan to create a Gratia plot that shows how opportunistic usage is varying on a site by site basis as competition for opportunistic usage is noticeably increasing. (Brian, Dan).

---++ Engage (Mats, John, Chris)

9 users utilized 34 sites

31075 jobs total (24874 / 6201 = 80.0% success)

144606.5 wall clock hours total (83832.0 / 60774.5 = 58.0% success)

Problem with the main submit host falling over. Twice this weekend. We are investigating, but it probably has to do with the virtualization and heavy I/O.


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Waiting for VDT to finish changes before starting VTB testing of OSG 1.2.10
   * Document and ITB Robot efforts ongoing

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.9
      *       79 (-1) OSG 1.2.X resources (      20 are 1.2.9)
      *        6 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       1 are 1.0.6)

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * D0
      * Good MC production rate last week: 11.6 Million Events/week. 128,000 wall hours/day at 87% efficiency.
      * Ongoing sites related issues:
         * UTA: Robert/FNAL&#39;s retry failed. Abhishek spoke with Mark Sosebee; it is a VOMS/GUMS FQAN mapping issue. D0 teams are using different FQANs for SE and CE workflows. Joel is confirming with D0 team. VOs Group has conveyed to OSG Security team to look into possible inclusion in OSG distribution&#39;s template.
         * Purdue and Caltech: Low efficiency.

   * SBGrid/NEBioGrid
      * Evaluating !GlideinWMS; expanding to more sites.

   * !IceCube
      * Moving from testing phase to production. 
      * Setting up dedicated Glidein submit infrastructure.
      * Have expressed interest in a joint task force (after reviewing nanoHUB and SBGrid archived documents); Abhishek in discussion with Steve B.

   * [Carried over item] Encouraging VO managers to evaluate potential use of the new script interface. These scripts are expected to help VO&#39;s members to get grid certificate and to import it as a PKCS12 file into web browsers.
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGetCmd
      * VOs Group&#39;s Feedback to OSG Security -- A drawback with the new mechanism: It requires an additional overhead of installing OSG stack components using Pacman, unlike the browser based mechanism. End-users are less likely to have access to such centrally-installed software stack. Browser based mechanism is standalone and simpler to operate; it is confusing due to the need to create and remember 3 passwords. 
      * Looking for more feedback from OSG Security Team. In particular, for SBGrid.
