   * Fermigrid - No incidents last week

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production Release
   * OS updates, reboots are required.
   * VM host software to be updates on one host, brings all hosts to same version.
  *  Fermigrid - No changes planned this week.
  * Condor Upgrades this week at UCSD. GOC factory upgrade to come.



---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * To accomodate the Condor file transfer functionality delivery date, we have pushed back the Bosco v1 release date to July 20, 2012, but...
   * We are also increasing the Bosco v1 scope to include an admin install that will support multiple users on the same submit node.
   * We continue to make progresss on HTPC with our deployment of dynamic slots at UW-Madison. We are now collecting some statistics and things appear to be working as advertised. We will continue expanding the number of machines with dynamic slots and should be in a position in another couple of weeks to begin documenting best practices for implementing HTPC with dynamic slots.
   * We have 4 campuses profiled now on the deployed campuses page.
   * Brooklin will be at U Chicago on Tue-29-May to visit with Dan, Rob, Derek and Marco


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * OSG 3.1.3 release today
      * Updates to ca certificates
      * gridftp security bug fix

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.3 / 1.2.28
      *       27 (0) OSG 3.x (       4 are 3.1.3)
      *       73 (-5) OSG 1.2.X resources (      15 are 1.2.28)
      *        1 (-1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * New DDos Attack using grid resources to attack third parties. Affects Europe only. We will shortly provide an announcement to our sites. Basic security precautions wuld have prevented this attack. we will remind our site admins what these are. 
      * gridftp vulnerability and patch. Medium level vulnerability is discovered last week. Globus already gave the patch and been tested. Will include it in our security announcement. 
   
   * Operations
      * Incident drill is finished. All tier3 sites did well. They were able to complete the tasks. We prepared an analysis and a summary document based on our observation. We will share it with area coordinators in detail. There are some areas we should make some improvements. E.g. GUMS banning feature was hard to use. Terrific learning experience for Tier3s. All-day long one-one training to teach them how to execute steps in the incident response. We will continue performing this with other Tier3s. 
      * Moving the CA rpm locations. The deadline is May 30th. A reminder will be incuded in the security announcement. 
      * SHA-2 transition. IGTF has recommended that CAs may be prepared to issue SHA-2 certs after 1/2013. After 1/2014 CAs should start issuing SHA-2 certs. Shared the recommendationw ith the software team that currently leads the project. 
      * New CA releases are coming out. Routine changes. 
      * Security Test and Controls are undergoing. You may be contacted with if we need to update some of the controls. Thank you for your cooperation.
