---+++ Attendees : 
   * Rob S., Mine, Anand, Marco, Dan
---+++ Significant/Action Items:
   * Pakiti released a version with fine grained access control. This means that a central service can query all the CMS T3 sites for known software vulnerabilities, but site admins viewing the data will only see data from their own sites. This was a requirement from CMS.
      * In response to this requirement the Pakiti developers rushed this feature into the code. (Anand, please thank the developers for us.)
   * The code is currently released as a development version. Anand has tested it, and submitted a few bugs, but feels that it is working well.
   * The OSG security team will do a limited centralized implementation of some CMS T3 sites until the official release of the next version of Pakiti (no official date yet for the release). Then they will plan to implement a centralized version running against all the CMS T3 sites. Sites do not need to install the application but can still login and view their results. The CMS T3 coordinator will have a centralized view of data from all the CMS T3 sites.
   * The centralized version is limited by job submission in that it will only query one host at a site (the headnode or a worker node) each time it runs. Still this is a good starting point, although larger sites may want to run the Pakiti client locally against a larger or complete set of hosts. (The CMS T1 runs Pakiti locally).
