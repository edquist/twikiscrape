-- Main.DanFraser - 18 Jun 2009
---++ Action/Significant Items
   * Admin workshop in August (6-7) will be hands-on and enable sites to upgrade/install OSG 1.2 prior to LHC turn-on.
   * Gratia probe is now in the ITB with 95% functionality. Remaining functionality requires root and will probably need to be run manually.
   * Spike down in usage this week but the cause appears normal (recovering from STEP09, CMS-Week ...)
   * Ligo will be testing a code fix on CMS sites that enables quick recovery from pre-emption. (Britta)

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * ITB testing is continuing
   * New VDT and ITB releases occurring this afternoon.
   * Will have meeting this afternoon to determine current status and scheduling/vo testing

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
   * Site Admin meeting: August 6-7, Indianapolis
      * Announced on OSG-news
      * Organization meeting today: agenda details will be soon there (twiki and indico) 
      * Please fill the survey: [[http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=mt3Lp1dxF3BQNoHHralA0w_3d_3d][here]] 
      * planning twiki: SiteCoordination.SiteAdminsWorkshopAug2009
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG):
      * Label differ &quot;OSG-x.y&quot; &lt; 1.0.1, &quot;OSG x.y&quot; after
      * Most recent version is OSG 1.0.4
      * 27 OSG 1.0.X resources (14 are 1.0.4)

      * 4 OSG 0.8.0
      * 1 OSG 0.6.8

---++ Metrics (Brian)

   * RSV Gratia probe is being finalized at a technical level - should be included with the RSV v3 release.  Currently in ITB.  Still finalizing some technical-level details
   * New cluster in Omaha pushed the OSG daily total above 900K wall hours / day.  Last weekly period was the largest usage on OSG ever.
   * Work continues with GOC to base more metrics capabilities out of OIM instead of Nebraska databases.  This week, we were able to migrate over CPU normalization information to OIM.
   * Metrics Gratia code is ready for next Gratia release.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * D0 -- MC Production is picking up after a week&#39;s drop. Last week, 70000 wall hours per day, with an average of 9 million events per week. Previous week&#39;s drop was to a level less than 4 million events per week.
   
   * !CompBioGrid -- 3 tickets pending: 6696, 6733, 6992. A minor OSG-side deficiency was in tickets prioritization. Analyzed the approach with !CompBioGrid. Progress now being made on PBS ticket with help from NERSC. Other 2 tickets are GIP and RSV; secondary; work ongoing with osg-sites list.
   
   * !IceCube -- [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20090618/IceCubeStorageModel-06-18-09.pdf][Document]] with storage requirements received from !IceCube. Forwarded to Tanya / OSG Storage.
   
   * CDF -- Document on storage requirements is awaited; expected in 2-4 weeks.
   
   * GPN -- Greg has started to join weekly VO forums.
   
   * ITB 1.1 validation by VOs -- Set to start, soon after Persistent ITB is stable and ready.

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

   * !ReSS Tomcat restart request sent to sites on Monday. 
   * Minimum Operational Production resource requirements. With respect to !GridPlexus. 
   * Gratia-RSV Probe -- We are working with the Gratia team to fix the root permissions issue. 
   * In discussion with WLCG about Tier 1 emergency contact information. 
   * Monday there were over 100 active tickets at the GOC. This is the first time we&#39;ve hit this many open tickets at a single time. I&#39;m watching closely to see if this is a spike or a trend in tickets.
