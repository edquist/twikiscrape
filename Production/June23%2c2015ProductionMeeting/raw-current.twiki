---+++ This Week
   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2015/06/goc-service-update-tuesday-june-23th-at.html][Release note]]
   * We experienced a possible account compromise and spam event on the opensciencegrid.org website. [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/25960][Ticket]] has details. You will probably get access denied unless you are a member of the Operations or Security team. If you’d like access to review this please let GOC know. 
      * The attacker posted 16 messages advertising “cheap fake oakley sunglasses” beginning early this morning. These appeared in the News section (http://www.opensciencegrid.org/news/) of the site. The postings came from various ISPs in southern and western US. When we learned of the postings we immediately removed all non-administrative user accounts and deleted the spam postings. They were online for ~6 hours before being noticed and removed. We confirmed the Wordpress and OS versions were up to date.

---++ Security (Jeny, Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * opensciencegrid.org website got hacked and spammed with some adverts. We got notified of the issue on Monday morning and worked with GOC promptly. The spam contact was taken down, unnecessary user accounts shut down, and we examined the log files. We are at the last step of the incident response right now: closure. it is triaged, contained and eradicated. Our goal focus on preventing this from happening again. GOC added some additional logging service. We also found out that we had many user accounts that were unnecessary and decided to delete them permanently. Since the wordpress server was up to date on its version and watches we did not ask for any changes t the server. 
   * Operations
      * OSG CA Tests. We are waiting for GOc to complete its tests.  With that we will conclude the testing phase. 
      * The planing for Transitioning phase will start in August. Please be aware that we will transition VOs one by one. We need to schedule which month (from January to June) a VO can get transitioned. We will work with VOs and GOC to create the schedule. 
      * CMS and Atlas will begin testing as soon as we pass our written and operational IGTF review, expected at the end of the summer. I expect that their tests can start in October. 
      * CMS Phedex transfers security question. Fermilab phedex operators claims that an LCG policy forces them to use personal certificates for the service, which is very difficult to manually renew every 8 days. They ask us to research a better option. We are looking into the policy. At the worst case, we will have another solution that will not break the policy but also avoid them form having to renew at each 8 days. 
   * CVMFS security drill is now schedule for the end of July.
