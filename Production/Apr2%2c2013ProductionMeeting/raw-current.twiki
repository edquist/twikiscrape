---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 17,110 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~307 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS production over the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 20-26K running jobs, mostly simulation type. Many new simulation tasks were defined, so some relative slowdown in recent production rate must be over.

      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.4 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around ~700TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * USATLAS working on providing opportunistic resources to more VOs, on more USATLAS sites.  
   * Issues

   * Restart of apache on some services due to DOEGrids CRL expiration issue. 
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Continue working the unknown VO ticket, goc 14222, have stopped a number of inbound unknown vo records, will work on subtracting them out.  
      * have asked OSG Software team to make the default to not report NoDNRecords and UnknownVO Records
      * Need to set meeting with regards to future of ReSS.  The new osg-info-services script is  producing malformed classads which ReSS cannot process and is causing extensive garbage collection and requiring ReSS to be restarted about every other day.  Will do so after Rob Q. and Scott are back in 2 weeks.
      * Working with &quot;Snowmass&quot; group of the OSG VO for glideinwms submission.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Disabled glidein monitoring slots by default from the factory
      * Fully migrated all Frontends off of decommissioned UCSD factory and onto SDSC Factory.
      * Made HTCondor 7.8.8 available for glideins to use.
      * Friday March 29 was a holiday at UCSD for Cesar Chavez day.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB Release
      * Minor updates - Notification will go out later this week.
   * APEL/Gratia tickets are now handled by the GOC rather than FNAL contributes. 

---++ New Virtual Organizations
| Name | VO URL | Other Info | Ticket |
| JLab | | In attendance. Jefferson Lab has been somewhat adjacent to OSG since the PPDG days. They are currently collaborating with the GLUEx VO and are joining OSG mainly to transition into the OSG PKI from DOEGrids | 
| glast.org | | In Attendance: Glast.org joined OSG because about 30% of their members are stateside and needed a CA. They may also need some computing resources |


---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)

---++ Software (Tim)
   * !XRootD fire today
      * EPEL released xrootd-3.3.1 in early March

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
    * Last week:
       * Tested OSG packages for release (primarily LSF related packages)
       * vo-package testing
   * Ongoing test
      * Wrapped up most LSF changes and fixes, one small osg-configure fix left
      * Currently investigating SLURM/CE scalability issues @ UNL
---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.16 / 1.2.32
      *       75 (5) OSG 3.x (       1 are 3.1.16)
      *       35 (-1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.32)

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
In the last 2 weeks, vo=osg has been able to access an average of 193K hours per day; the peak was 380K hours in one day.  We want to thank the many sites who have provided these opportunistic cycles:  Tusker, MWT2, red-gateway, Nebraska, PNNL_OSG, !GridUNESP, UCSDT2, SPRACE, SMU, CIT_CMS_T2, Firefly, Purdue, BNL_ATLAS, TTU_ANTAEUS, MIT_CMS, and many others.

But in the last 4-5 days, OSG usage as a whole has dropped.  AND vo=osg has dropped from being able to access &gt;10,000 cores to about 4,000 cores despite the fact that there is lots of work that is in queue; we are investigating.


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Gsi-ssh vulnerability is reported. Moderate level vulnerability. users can switch identities by exploiting a memory bug. The PermitPAMUserChange option must be turned on for the exploit to happen. This is by default turned off. Advisory said this option is used in association with MyProxy. we are checking if the osg services such as oasis-login and software packages have this option enabled or not.
   * Operations
      * User jobs without certificates. Traceability requirements. Did a security exercise with OSG-XSEDE frontend. Went successful. Initially they were able to easily find out the list of users who have submitted jobs to a worker node at a given time frame. Upon further investigation, we found out that the frontend has the capability to uniquely identify the end user whose job is being traced at the worker node. 
      * Traceability next steps: will do a security exercise with a site. Goals are to understand how does a site detect, monitor and identify a problem job. can they provide the information needed by glideinwms factory and frontend to trace it back to the user. We emailed nebraska site and asked for help. 
      * CIlogon Basic usage at U of Wisconsin. U of Wisconsin is fully functional with CIlogon Basic CA and also provides a command line tool for users. Glow VO is very interested in using this for end users submitting jobs to Fermilab. Security team set up a test machine at Fermilab for Zach Miller to test the workflow end-end. We also gathered the next steps form Fermilab security team to move this into production if Glow VO decide to request that. 
      * Oasis/cvmfs security assessment. Fully completed. Will upload to docdb and send to ET and area coordinators. 
      * We promised April as the beginning of sha-2 tests. Brian and Suchandra got their personal certs to test. Anyone else. The software team? The sceurity team is reday to provdie the test certs form DigiCert.
