---+!! Background and High Level Goals

---++ Background
CMS -
   * There are seven Tier-2s, and the number is constant
   * T3s are looking more like a growth industry
      * Currently 20-T3s in the US (38 internationally)
      * 10 of these are registered as OSG sites
      * Could be as many as 20 new T3s in the next few years
      * Registration in OSG is a grass-roots effort (the better the perceived benefit, the more will join)
      * There is a 1/2 time CMS T3 support person and a full time T3 CMS liason
Atlas -
   * Expecting a similar growth pattern as CMS
   * A coherent client package for data replication (e.g. from Tier-2 to Tier-3) and data access is needed
   * Currently creating a T3 support group
      * Doug B. 1/2 time support, and planning another dedicated person
---++ High Level Goals
   1 Create two Storage Element (SE) &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; packages that can be easily installed and managed on T3s
      * Storage Elements are the most important (and most difficult) component of T3s.
      * Create one package for small ~20TB sites, and another for Larger systems
         * Current installation mechanism is difficult for T3s
      * Specify the architecture, configuration, and operation of each system
         * Can benchmark these so that we can specify the capabilities &amp; scalability of each system
      * Designed with input from CMS, Atlas, and the OSG storage team
         * Current thinking is that these patterns could be the same both Atlas and CMS
      * Perhaps security patches can be packaged specifically for these patterns
   1 Create a set of OSG policies for T3s similar to the T2 specifications
      * Look at T2 policies and identify which are applicable
      * Maintaining T3 security is a priority issue

---++ Additional Considerations
   * With the anticipated growth of T3s, T3s may eventually be able to overwhelm the sites w/data requests
      * Requiring access via FTS is one possible way of managing this.
