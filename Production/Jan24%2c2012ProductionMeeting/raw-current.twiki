---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.26

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Incidents/Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * TTU incident is ready to be closed. Got the final report from TTU security team and grid admins. Writing the osg report with lessons learned. 
      * Two new incidents reported from EGI. Do not think it affects OSG, but will make an announcement shortly. Again ssh compromises and rooted grid nodes. 
      * New vulnerabilities:
         * Mysql released 27 vulnerabilities. 7 of which affects the mysql version we distribute and depend on for osg services such as gratia, gums, voms, and so on. Some are rated important. Worked with GOC and Fermilab operation teams to make sure operational servers are not vulnerable. VDT will make a release when patches become available. Will send an announcement to OSG sites shortly. even if they do not use VDT mysql, they should still check their system mysql versions and update as necessary. 
         * Openssl vulnerability released today. We do not distribute openssl in VDT, but we will investigate if it is important and send it to our sites.  
         * Older vulnerabilities: Tomcat fix is released today. 

   * DOEgrids signing CA renewal. Investigated how this will affect end user browsers. Test cases are at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/BrowserCACertTesting. We should make end users aware that they should renew their CA store with new ca cert before Jan 23 2013. Otherwise, their browsers will stop working for https. 

   * New IGTF release is reday and will be sent to ITB. Includes production Digicert CA approved by IGTF

   * Started planning a new incident drill. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/2012SecurityDrillPlan. We want to work with sites we never worked before. Initial candiate list we have is: BELLARMINE-ATLAS-T3, Baylor-Trash/Tier3-CE, Beocat_CE, Clemson-Palmetto, FLTECH, IllinoisHEP, NWICG_NotreDame, OSG-Rice, RENCI-Blueridge, uprm-cms-ce. Let us kow if you propose a different site list? 
   * CA release process. Got the list of sites who download the ca rpms form goc. prepared the email to contact them. Our aim is to find a way to transition everyone to a single ca distribution point.
