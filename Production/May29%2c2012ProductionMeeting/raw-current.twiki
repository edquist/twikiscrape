Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
Actively moving NEES users from RENCI-Engage to submit host at Purdue; and identifying possible issues in new environment.  Looking for a new submit host for LSST to use as we migrate them away from RENCI-Engage; probably will use the OSG-XSEDE host as a temporary environment.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * Gridftp vulnerability was announced. 
   * Operational Work Items
      * This week the old GOC rpm repo will be turned off -- May 31st. Work is completed: comm. and coordinating with sites is completed. 
      * New project coming up. We have been maintaining old and new layout for the CA bundles. We made the switch earlier. Our software is tested and some sites already switched to new layout. We never phased out the old layout. We start the transition project this week. 
      * New drill with Trash/Tier3 sites next week June 5th and 7th. We will send the report to ET after completing this round of drills. 
      * A new ticket with DOEGrids CA operations. Question regarding the latency to generate a new CRL when a user request certificate revocation. 
      * Fermilab VO request to identify the pilot jobs. Entered as a stakeholder request. 
      * Progress with Security Test and Controls.
