---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC had stable operation during the last week. Overall the runs were shorter, due to some technical issues, so the collected luminosity for the week was not as high as a week earlier. Current total collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~17.5 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was very stable, at the average level around 20K running jobs. Reprocessing of the Express Stream was completely finished, with preparation for bulk reprocessing, probably to start this week.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.1M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 91%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.35 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 200~400TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

!NoVA has been trying out the CVMFS based architecture for software distribution using the server at Wisconsin and have had good success to date (running individual jobs that access the software from Wisconsin).  They are now looking at moving to the next steps of scale testing leading to production.  There are worker node side work items that they are addressing with help from Fermigrid team and SMU.  On the CVMFS server side they want to develop a plan to migrate from the Wisconsin server toward a service that can be the longer-term repo for !NoVA.  Chander had briefly informed them about the OSG plan to host a CVMFS (as part of OASIS) at the OSG GOC.  They inquired about when (the sooner the better) they could clone their setup at Wisconsin to the OSG GOC server to test the equivalent functionality that exists today.  And they want more information about the OSG plans for evolving this service to production level.
