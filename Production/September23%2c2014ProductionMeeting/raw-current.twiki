---++ Action/Significant Items: 
   * Scalability studies of HTCondor have demonstrated 90,000 simultaneous running jobs using 7-8 schedd
   * Underlying bottleneck mechanism is unknown at this time but discussions are on-going
   * Scott will report next week on SPLINTER plans

---++ Attendees: Tony, Kevin, Scott, Chander, Tim C, Tim T, Xin, Armen

---++ CMS (Tony)

   * Job statistics for last week
      * 16,353 jobs/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not so stable, at the average level of 14-30K running jobs. The reason was not enough job load. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.4 M jobs, 2M walltime hours, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 67%. 
      * 1.2 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate was ~250TB/day, at BNL Tier1, for last week

   * Grid Operations Center
      * ITB release, no difficulties encountered.
      * Gratiaweb difficulties. Continue running only one instance, updating once per day.
         * Configured to determine the location of the problem. (or show it is elsewhere)
         * static-graphs is the problem.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Nothing of interest
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Discovered a fatal glideinwms bug that caused the CERN factory to spawn child processes out of control
         * vocms0305 factory had to be rebooted September 18th
         * glideinwms team discovered the problem and supplied a patch for it
         * This has not been observed in any other factory, it seems to be a really rare corner case
         * Still investigating what actually caused the corner case

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
OSG-XD submit node upgrade appears to be working well after two weeks of use.  The OSG VO has been averaging over 400K hours per day for the last two weeks.

In the last couple of weeks we enabled UFlorida and Oklahoma sites for OSG VO access.

Production continues to be demand limited; we are working a couple of avenues to find more researchers who can benefit from OSG DHTC.

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * No new vulnerabilities or incidents
   * Upcoming security drill testing HTCondor-CE
   * Several requests for robot certs recently. Digicert working with IGTF to get their robot cert profile to align with IGTFs.
