---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production Release
      * Production rack maintenance, [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/Rack_Power.png][Result.]] Total load dropped from 6.2 kW to less than 5.0 kW.
      * Service update [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-24th.html][Release note]]
      * CMS Ticket Exchange (GOC to FNAL Service Now) went fully live. 
         * Other FNAL VOs to follow on next production window. 
   * Software 1.2.26 Release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/osg-1226-software-release.html][Release Notification]]
   * XSEDE server and storage are up and running, storage formatted, OS installed.
   * Web pages outages at Tilted Planet. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/problems-accessing-opensciencegridorg_24.html][Notification 1]] and [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/problems-accessing-opensciencegridorg.html][Ticket 2]].
   * Found bug is VOMS RPM Configuration which caused high load and memory usage if more than one VO was used. 
      * Fixed with a documentation update that specifically allocates memory for Tomcat5. 
   *  WMS Glide In Factory
      * Discovered unexpected behavior where condor-g does not forward updated proxy to CE unless there is &lt; 6h left on it even if it was updated on submit node.
         * This creates a window where glideins fail because gwms internally sets a 12h lower limit for minimum time left on a proxy a glidein is allowed to start with.
         * Jaime Frey gave us a gridmanager to test that allows us to change the 6h condor limit.  We will test it this week.
         * We notified gwms developers as well.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Fifth Tuesday, no release.
   * opensciencegrid.org Domain transfer to IU postponed to February 28th maintenance window. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OpenScienceGridWeb][Planning Document]]
   * Meeting to design new www.opesciencegrid.org webpage scheduled next week.
   * Meeting to discuss Condor usage Gratia probes scheduled for Wednesday morning [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-34][Ticket]].
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Still may test condor 7.6.6 on ITB Factory this week but will focus on testing Jaime&#39;s new gridmanager first.

---+++ Gratia Review
   * I noticed these numbers on Weekly Gratia report. I&#39;ve begun to create tickets to see if we can identify why these sites are being reported and fix them.
      * 23 registered sites have stopped reporting (15% of OSG Sites)
      * 27 registered sites have never reported (18% of OSG Sites)
      * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11551][Parent Ticket]]
   * No obvious oddities on gratiaweb reports. 

---++ Engage (Mats)


---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)

   * Ongoing bug fixes being worked on and tested

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.26
      *       90 (-2) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.26)
      *        2 (1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        3 (0) OSG 3.0
      *        6 (-1) Resources listing RPMs (OSG 3?)


---++ User Support (Chander)
[[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1087][On January 25, we briefed the Belle experiment and PNNL on how to join and integrate with OSG]] 

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Operations/Incidents/Vulnerabilities
      * TTU incident is officially closed. Final report and lessons-learned is sent to ET. 
      * Two recent incidents from EGI. Not related to OSG. EGI sites hadto be taken down. Announcement sent to OSG sites. 
      * Mysql vulnerability announcement is sent. Worked with Fermilab and GOC operations services to make sure osg machines are not vulnerable. VDT will also include the patch when there is one. 
      *  recived an important vulnerability from EGI they like to brodcats further. I do not think it affects many osg sites. we will send the announcement. 
   * Incident Drill. Checked the proposed sites with Doug Benjamin. He liked and added some more T3 sites. Atlas T3 apparently have CE. Have not heard from Snihur yet. 
   * CA release process. Contacted all sites who hits GOC for CA rpms. Only LBL had not responded. There are also couple of EU sites that hits GOC. we have no contact infor for EU sites and do not know why they hit GOC repos. 
   * New IGTF release with approved DigiCert is released into ITB. Will be in production next week. 
   * DOEgrids CA expiry problems. OSG cert request page now includes a mechanism for installing the new root CA. https://osg-test-ce.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cert-register/certrenew.php
