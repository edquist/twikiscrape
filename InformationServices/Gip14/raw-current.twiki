---+++ General Code Improvements
These are things which should be done regardless of what the 
   * Convert the simple printTemplate functions into a better framework
      * This will provide a better means to deprecate or remove specific attributes
      * Also provide better support for multiple attributes
   * Convert the CE modules into classes which inherit from a base class, much like the SE modules
   * Clean up and reorganize the contents of the SE modules
   * Clean up python namespace

---+++ FQAN ACBR support
   * Support the use of ACBR: VOMS:&lt;fqan&gt; for the CE and SE; esp needed for CMS sites.
   * Drop ACBR: &lt;vo name&gt; and only use ACBR: VO:&lt;vo name&gt;, as GLUE 1.3 specifies

---+++ Schema compliance
   * Review our usage of GLUE 1.3 -- remove deprecated attributes.
   * Make sure that optional attributes whose value cannot be determined are not advertised, instead of advertised with some default values.

---+++ Provider improvements
   * WS-GRAM support
   * Better SGE support - test case coverage
   * Make sure MPI integration happens

---+++ OSG Integration
   * Integrate with OIM for information where OIM is authoritative.
      * Contact points
      * Site name
      * Downtime information.
   * Integrate the SE code with Gratia probe
   * Send metrics data to RSV collector directly from the GIP itself.

---+++ Pie-in-the-sky
   * No decision about GLUE 2.0 has been made.
   * Consider indulging in the XML bindings of GLUE
