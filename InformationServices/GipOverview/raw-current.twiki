---+ High-level GIP Overview

The Generic Information Provider (GIP) is designed to be a modular information system for grid computing.  It aims to provide both static and dynamic information about a site on the grid.

---++ GIP Architecture.

The GIP combines the following information:
   * Static LDIF generated by the configuration tools (=$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gip=) and stored in =$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/ldif=
   * Dynamically generated LDAP entries from scripts in =$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/provider=
   * Dynamic updates to static entries from scripts in =$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/plugin=.

---++ Upcoming directory layout and environment changes

   * The VDT will set the =$GIP_LOCATION= environment variable to point to the GIP&#39;s top-level directory.
   * The top-level GIP directory is =$VDT_LOCATION/gip= 
   * The LDIF will go in =$GIP_LOCATION/var/ldif=
   * Providers go to =$GIP_LOCATION/providers= and plugins in =$GIP_LOCATION/plugins=.
