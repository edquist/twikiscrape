---+ About OSG&#39;s Engagement activity

---++ Goals
The OSG&#39;s user engagement activity has two fundamental objectives: 
   1. to bring the power of the OSG infrastructure to scientists and educators beyond the high energy physics domain; 
   1. and to use these experiences with new users and domains to drive new requirements for the natural evolution of the OSG infrastructure.

---++ The Engagement Process
The Engagement team works closely with these communities over periods of several months to help them derive this benefit. These activities include:  
   * providing an understanding of how to use the distributed infrastructure; 
   * adapting applications to run effectively on OSG sites; 
   * engaging in the deployment of community owned distributed infrastructures; 
   * working with the OSG Facility to ensure the needs of the new community are met; 
   * providing common tools and services in support of the engagement communities; 
   * and working directly with and in support of the new end users with the goal to have them transition to be full contributing members of the OSG.

Engagement activities have led to enhanced requirements and functionality of this system.
