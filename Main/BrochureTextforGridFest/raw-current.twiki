*What is the Open Science Grid?*

The Open Science Grid is a national computing infrastructure for science co-funded by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

The OSG is an expanding alliance of universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers.

The OSG contributes to the World Wide LHC Computing Grid as the US infrastructure on which the LHC experiments depend, collaborating with the European EGEE and NGDF national grid infrastructures.

By leveraging advanced software technologies, OSG brings together computing and data resources across campus, regional, national and international boundaries. More than 70 independent provider sites from more than 26 states in the US contribute to the power of the OSG.

The OSG builds bridges to move data and jobs between infrastructures&amp;ndash;including the EGEE in Europe and TeraGrid&lt;a href=&quot;https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/edit/Main/TeraGrid?topicparent=Main.BrochureTextforGridFest&quot; title=&quot;Create this topic&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt; in the US--as well as internally and between university campuses. The OSG therefore enables researchers to harness resources that span national and international boundaries.

*OSG Facts &amp; Figures*

90 members are in the Open Science Grid Consortium.

30 Virtual Organizations participate.

26 US states and the District of Columbia are represented.

14 partnerships with other network organizations and international, national, regional and campus grids exist.

More than 120 million hours of computation on OSG resources have occurred since August 2007.

OSG for LHC: In 2006 and 2007, OSG provided the ATLAS and CMS experiments with 30% of total processing cycles and moved more than 100 terabytes of data across 7 storage sites.
