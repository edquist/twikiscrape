---+!! *GlideinWMS Proactive Monitoring*

---++ Description
I hope this page will list the observed problems and methods for monitoring glideinwms Frontends.  Since this is focused on the GlideinWMS Frontends, we will focus on user jobs.


---++ Questions

---+++ Is the frontend running?
This is a simple problem without a great solution.  It is difficult to see if a frontend is running correctly.  The best way to test if  a frontend is running properly is to submit a user job, and see if it runs.

---+++ Are jobs running? 
This is related to the first point, is the frontend running?  This is more specific, are the user jobs matching and running on the resources at the glideinwms frontend.

---+++ Are job running successfully?
If the jobs are running on the remote resources connected to the GlideinWMS frontend, are they running to completion?  Are the exiting correctly?

---+++ Are the queues getting serviced in reasonable time (or stuck)?
Is the available resources to the frontend sufficient for the processing required.  This is more of a subjective metric, as the goal of DHTC is to have a limitless pile of computing to throw at the grid.

---+++  Are the jobs using OSG efficiently?
This has to do with CPU effeciency.

---+++ How can we graphically see the status of key items for all the frontends in some kind of summary view?
Can the factory provide a summary view of the frontends.
