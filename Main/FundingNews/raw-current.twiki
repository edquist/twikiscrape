---++ OSG News - June 2012
&lt;b&gt;The OSG has been funded by DOE and NSF for another five years. From 2012 through 2016. We are very appreciative of the support and trust our sponsors are showing, and excited to be continuing with this unique partnership&lt;/b&gt;]

The goals of the &quot;next five years&quot; are expressed through the summary of the proposal text: Our unique partnership will continue to innovate and deliver a fabric of distributed high throughput computing (DHTC) services that advance the discovery capabilities of scientists, researchers and academics from a broad range of disciplines by transforming their computational throughput.

Working with faculty and students on campuses as well as large multi-national scientific collaborations we will continue to promote and facilitate the sharing of autonomous resources through mutual trust relationships where all the elements are optimized to maximize computational throughput.

Moving forward the OSG project will continue to contribute to DOE’s and NSF’s goals to serve science and research by building on the experience and knowhow of our skilled personnel and the capabilities of our widely adopted suite of services to transform the scientific computing landscape on our campuses.

The OSG will continue to work with the LHC communities to achieve the needed exabyte-per-year data movement and commensurate computational throughput within the timeframe of this proposal. These advances will form the basis for helping other communities to increase their computing throughput by one or more orders of magnitude–thus transforming their discovery ability and potential. A major thrust will be the wide deployment of intra-campus DHTC capabil-ities locally at the nation’s campuses–ensuring a strong base for future scientific competitiveness in the nation’s academic community and educating a new generation of computational scientists and professionals. The OSG will further extend its reach as a service provider to the NSF Ex-treme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project.
