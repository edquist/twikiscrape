---++ Prepare questions pertaining to four documents:
---+++ Support Center Best Practices 
Contact: Doug Olson

(http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/StandardOperatingProcedures
exists; consider this a draft). 

   * First sentence too vague and generic: &quot;Operating procedures are initiated by some type of event that causes or motivates an action to occur.&quot;  Here&#39;s an idea for improvement (need to check that it&#39;s technically accurate): %BR% 
It is expected that user- and administrator-initiated events which in some way change the OSG operating environment will occur during operation. In order to mediate these events and/or integrate the resulting changes into the operating environment, OSG support staff is required to perform certain actions.  An OSG Operating Procedure corresponding to each type of event describes the required actions to take, and is initiated when the event occurs.

   * Under &quot;Requirements&quot;, you haven&#39;t addressed the 2nd two bullet points:  
      * Publication point for procedures
      * Type of access control for SOP documents 

   * VO reg looks ok
   * SC reg looks ok
   * RS reg looks ok
   * Grid Service update looks ok
   * Incident handling: Dates from &#39;04 and could use &quot;reviewed &#39;06 and still ok&quot;, or updates, as needed. HTML doesn&#39;t correspond to PDF; as I read the page, I expect it to. Create workflow diagram (or series of diagrams) similar to other items to provide easy reference.
   * Critical update: mention &quot;software&quot; in title. I&#39;d suggest making and linking to a web form that auto-mails &quot;for critical... report is written and sent to all SC with cc to Operations &amp; IEB...&quot;.  That way operations is sure to get the info they need to proceed.
   * Missing:
      * Receipt of email to GOC
      * How support center reports problem
      * urgent update
      * Anything else?

And Tim Silvers wrote a draft of Best Practices Guide for SC (Doug to point me to this).

---+++ Grid User&#39;s Guide 
(http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/GridUsersGuide exists). 
Contacts: FKW, Leigh.  My job: review, discuss with Frank and Leigh. (sent email 8/8)
   * Intro
      * Reword to clarify audience up front:
&quot;This TWiki page serves as entry point for documentation on how to use the OSG, directed primarily at the VO user support teams, rather than the actual scientist end-users. The OSG support model assumes the end-users to be supported by large VOs that provide the actual user interfaces and user support.&quot;

   *  &quot;Getting Access to computing resources via OSG&quot;: The instructions here sound like they&#39;re aimed at end users, not the support teams.  Seems like there should be:  
      * First, what does the generic VO admin have to do? 
      * Then have the VO admin point his/her end-users to http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/WebHome or sub area (needs structure and content)  E.g., CMS users are encouraged to use an LCG UI to access OSG resources.
      * &quot;Install OSG client&quot; should move to individual VO area; not true for CMS.
   * Using the Computing Resources
      * add links on terms like condor-g, gridftp, SRM, GRAM, DAG etc.
      * what&#39;s &quot;pre-WS&quot; GRAM
      * aren&#39;t job submission steps going to be VO-dependent?  Even if not, aren&#39;t these geared towards end-users?
      * &quot; Some Guidance on what to do when things don&#39;t work&quot;. Why not call it &#39;Troubleshooting&#39;? Also looks directed at end-users and VO admins.
Seems this doc has more than one audience. This should be clarified, and the info for each group needs to be somehow separated. Could use some thought.

---+++ Grid Application Install Guide
Where do we tell VOs that they need to install their app on each grid site?  Or do they need to on each and every one?

To cover generic aspects that all 
VO-specific app installers need to know.  My job: figure out what the 
content should be, add links to VO-spec pages for VO-spec instructions that 
need to follow the generic ones.  Look for VO app inst pages; talk to VO 
admins about their pages. (Ruth to send list of VOs and their contact 
persons.)

http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/GridAppInstallGuide

&lt;!--Talk to Don P., Bob Cowles about discussing VO web pages as a responsibility (for the Wed 1:00 parallel session VOs responsibility and agreements)--&gt;

This should be the generic page, not the ATLAS-specific page. 
Aim for generic page with things all app installers need to know/do.  Point to app-specific instructions maintained on VO pages (not OSG pages).

What are generic requirements?
   * use pacman and globus tools
   * follows the OSG local storage policy, i.e. it uses $OSG_APP, which is visible to all the worker nodes
   * how much disk space can you use in total (indicates how many versions you can maintain concurrently)
   * VOMS server issues (special roles for app installers?)
   * GUMS account names
   * put installation commands in a job, send to the remote gatekeeper fork jobmanager.
   * &quot;basic installation procedure&quot; looks close to generic (but needs some links, more info):
      * find where $OSG_APP is on the remote site
      * install and set up pacman in $OSG_APP area
      * create all the necessary subdirectories below $OSG_APP/&lt;your VO&#39;s area&gt;, and do a pacman install
      * check the information in the local file $OSG_APP/etc/grid3-locations.txt, (through MDS information provider). A webpage is also updated automatically.

---+++ Storage Element admin guide (use dcache workshop results to start with. 
I think this is http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/StorageDcacheWorkshop.) 
Signed by FKW. %BR%
(asked to meet with Rob K and/or Eileen B ahead of time)

I&#39;d like an organization like:
   * What is decache 
   * how does it fit into OSG
   * how might it fit in with your site, your resources
   * how to install and configure it
   * how to use it
      * list things to use it for
      * list different ways to use it (like with ROCKS)
      * ...
   * troubleshooting
   * future features
   * references to more info

And fill the above slots with info from what&#39;s there now (and maybe more):

   * What is the linked &quot;layperson dcache intro&quot; written in? I can&#39;t read it. Can we move content to twiki?
   * Should have twiki &quot;dcache install guide&quot; separate from install_note (in txt format)
   * &quot;dcache on ROCKS&quot; -- what&#39;s ROCKS?  Seems to do with Ganglia, but can&#39;t find explanation.
   * Action items are good. Why still using plone?  I can&#39;t access the files on the plone site. Need explanation of the what the cells are. (RKennedy)
   * Is there anything we can take from the Enstore manual dcache chapter?
   * What of the FAQ and discussion needs to go in?

---++ Thoughts on the twiki
To start, the Doc Activity has proposed a &quot;tools&quot; section of main web page:
   * OSG at Work (TWiki)   &lt; This is what I&#39;m reviewing in this section, with eye towards what else exists, and where best to put stuff...
   * Document Database
   * Knowledge Base (content needs to be transferred to other areas) -- Need someone here--
   * Logos and Templates
   * Monitoring
   * Security
   * Support 

---+++ Current Twiki webs
Twiki home is advertized as &quot;collaboration area for Open Science Grid Development related issues&quot;.   I think it has multiple thrusts
   * houses all the user technical doc (how-to guides)
   * houses OSG activity (and TG?) collaboration pages (meeting minutes, plans, schedules)
I suggest splitting into two, because the &quot;tools&quot; section should have an obvious link to &quot;Technical Documentation&quot;.  Split (current) Documentation twiki web out so that the first two items under Tools are
   * OSG at Work (TWiki)
   * Technical Documentation (TWiki)

The different webs are (with my comments ):
   $ Architecture and Principles:  (used for blueprint, but barely; I&#39;d get rid of this)
   $ Trash/Deployment Activity - Work of the Executive Team: (usage ok; who updates metrics? Keep here only if a deployment person does.)
   $ Documentation Infrastructure: (keep doc activity related stuff here only; rename the rest to Documentation and separate; I&#39;ll look at this separately as regards organization)
   $ OSG Trash/Trash/Integration Activity: (this has lots more info than deployment activ page, reflective of nature of activity maybe)
   $ OSG Interoperability: (the subpage OSGLcgInteroperability should be in &quot;Documentation&quot; I think; it&#39;s a tech how-to)
   $ OSG Monitoring and Information Services: (this is a TG, not an activity; not parallel structure. What about other TGs, where do they keep their meeting minutes and such?)
   $ OSG Operations Activity: (several documents that look like they need to be locatable by different types of users, most under &quot;support&quot;; if so, move this info to under the support item in &quot;Tools&quot;, e.g., out of the twiki. Else if these are working docs and users only need what&#39;s already under &quot;support&quot;, ok. But make it clear they&#39;re only working docs.)
   $ OSG Operations Provisioning - for OSG 0.4.: (looks fine at first glance, but remove the version number in name here, just have it in the page contents)
   $ Storage on the OSG: (If bmp file is important enough, make a gif and attach it to the page. Add any how-to pages listed under &quot;storage element implementations&quot; to tech doc twiki)

---+++ OSG at Work twiki organization
I&#39;d order the OSG at Work twiki more like this. It wasn&#39;t obvious to me that most of the webs related to an activity or TG, right off.
   * Trash/Deployment Activity
   * Trash/Trash/Integration Activity
   * Documentation Activity
   * Operations Activity
   * Interoperability Activity
   * Operations Provisioning Activity
   * (other activities?)
   * Monitoring and Information Services TG
   * Storage TG
   * (other TGs?)

Question: where to put general collaborator info (e.g., list of regularly scheduled activity/tg meetings). How about OSG@work twiki home page?

---+++OSG Documentation twiki organization

---++ Things to discuss with people at OSG Seattle mtg
Fred, Kyle
   * What are issues with kbase that make us need to convert info out of it? (my curiosity!)
   * Ideas on what to convert it to?  Manual inside twiki (a la CMS offline manual)?
   * All tech doc is to be in twiki?
   * Does it make sense to reorganize the twiki?  If so, discuss general outline.
   * Discuss ideas for document maintenance (I need to write procedure)
Leigh, Frank W, Xin H (and VO admins)
   * What are the common install steps that every VO app install needs to do?  Is it basically what&#39;s at http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/GridAppInstallGuide minus the ATLAS-specific stuff?
   * Do we want the individual VOs to maintain their VO-spec install instructions at their own site?  (as opposed to OSG twiki page linked to this main app install page)
   * Which VOs have app install instructions so far?
      * ATLAS (in wrong place, and without many details)
      * CMS (I think) https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/CMSSW_aptinstaller
      * others?
   * Grid users guide
      * What is primary thrust of this user guide, and should we title it more aptly?
      * Narrow down what is really VO-generic info, and what isn&#39;t
      * Separate out what is really for VO admins and what&#39;s for end-users
      * Get VO admins to write up their instructions in the VO section of the twiki
Doug O, Frank W
   * Best practices or SOP for troubleshooting/diagnostics -- ideas?
Mike W
   * Relating EOT to technical instructions
