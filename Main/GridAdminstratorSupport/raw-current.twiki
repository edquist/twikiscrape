OSG Site, Resource and VO Administrators are an important part of making the distributed facility work, test new services, software and configurations, and communicate with and help each other.

The osg-general* mail list is a good source of information and discussion and the osg-int* is The place for the Trash/Trash/Integration Infrastructure and testing of new software.

The [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/MonitoringInformation/WebHome][Monitoring]] page has lots of good links.
