---++ Running CPASS at Nebraska

CPASS is implemented as a web application and is available at http://cpass.unl.edu/. It enables the comparison of experimentally identified ligand-binding sites to infer biological function and aid in drug discovery. To use the application use the following steps:

   1. Log in to http://cpass.unl.edu/cpassweb/index.html using the assigned username and password.
   1. Provide the information regarding the Job e.g. PDB File, a Job Title, Chain Identifier, and other parameters for type of comparison, etc.  Submit the web form.
   1. On successful job submission of web form the response page has a Job ID of the submitted job for future reference and tracking its progress. The server side scripts launch the cpass by submitting them for processing to OSG sites using Condor and glideinWMS.

---++ Monitoring the jobs

Type your Job ID at http://cpass.unl.edu/cpassweb/cgi-bin/status.cgi to check the status of the job.

Additionally, on completion of the job an email with the link to the results display page is sent to the user.
