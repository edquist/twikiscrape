---++ About This Document
The OSG coordinates with and leverages the work of many other projects that collaborate with OSG in different ways.  

%BLUE% 
When there are funding opportunities available that might benefit the OSG the Council is informed. One of more Council and other Consortium members can approach the Executive Team to discuss areas of mutual interest where the opportunity might provide benefit. Often, this approach has already been made and ideas for beneficial work discussed and agreed upon in general. It should be noted that these are driven by the stakeholders and Consortium members who have ideas and directions. They will need to have enough lead time and discussion time to understand whether there is agreement, or not, that the ideas are mutually beneficial. Given the resources and constraints of a coherent heterogeneous program many may not be.

%ENDCOLOR%

Projects are classified as satellites if they have a significant dependency on OSG and expect to collaborate closely with OSG. These projects are Satellite Projects if they meet the following pre-requisites:
   1. OSG was involved in the planning process and there was communication and coordination between the proposal’s PI and OSG Executive Team before submission to agencies.
   1. OSG commits support for the proposal and/or future collaborative action within the OSG project.
%BLUE% 
The specific support,  actions and OSG commitments  will, for Satellites after May 2012, be documented in a letter of support or other note kept in the OSG Document Respository. 
%ENDCOLOR%
   3. The project agrees to be considered an OSG Satellite project.
%BLUE% 
   4. For each satellite a liaison is identified. Usually, but not always, this liaison is an OSG project Area Lead or their designee. For some satellites the Liaison is a member of the Executive Team or the Council. It is the responsibility of the liaison to facilitate reports on the satellite to the project and Council, and to help the Council track the mutual benefits gained.

Satellite project are independent projects with their own project management, reporting, and accountability to their program sponsors; the OSG core project does not provide oversight for the execution of the satellite project’s work program.  This document defines the three types of Satellites, describes the OSG Interface with them, and contains pointers to information on these projects.

---++ Type 1 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 1 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that plan to provide capabilities (including testing and certification) or services that will be made available to OSG stakeholders using the OSG infrastructure.

---+++ Interface
Individual OSG Executive team members, usually via the OSG project
manager, serves as the interface to these projects. We jointly document a short
synopsis of work goals, milestones and planned deliverables into OSG, expectations
from OSG, and current status/progress. This document is updated quarterly and
serves as the basis for joint quarterly (phone) meetings between the project and
OSG to understand issues and progress and refine goals.  These meetings are scheduled by the OSG Project Manager as part of the ongoing Area Coordinator meetings which already has the appropriate OSG personnel in attendance to serve as the conduit for this project
to deliver via the OSG infrastructure. As appropriate, the OSG project manager will
include these milestones into the WBS so as to inform the rest of the OSG staff.
These projects are asked to contribute to the OSG annual report.

---++ Type 2 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 2 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that work to directly meet the needs of OSG stakeholders and
the resulting work is expected to be “included” in the OSG at some future time;
examples include software that becomes part of the VDT or testing and
characterization of grid capabilities that contribute to advancing the OSG
infrastructure and principles.  A project of a research nature, where the result is unknown at the outset, might naturally fit as a Type 2 project.

---+++ Interface
Individual OSG Executive Team Members, usually via the OSG project
manager, serves as the interface to each of these projects. We jointly document a
short synopsis of goals, planned deliverables, expectations from OSG, and current
status/progress; the intent is to only cover the “touchpoints” between the satellite
project and the core OSG project. This document is updated quarterly and serves
as the basis of joint quarterly (phone) meetings between the satellite project and the
OSG Area Coordinators to understand issues and progress. These projects are asked to contribute to
the OSG annual report.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 2 Projects and the Responsible OSG Executive Team Member:
   * [[Management.AdvancedNetworkandDistributedStorageLaboratory][100 Gigabit]] Testing (Frank Wuerthwein) - Miron Livny
   * [[http://pegasus.isi.edu/corralwms/][CorralWMS]] (Ewa Deelman, Burt Holzman) - Ruth Pordes

---++ Type 3 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 3 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that use OSG outputs for further research; they may provide intellectual feedback to OSG but do not substantially change the OSG infrastructure
or directly impact the OSG stakeholders. These projects are generally expected to
produce outputs for the funding agencies and other collaborations that have the
potential for positive impact on OSG.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Council provides the mechanism for these projects
to keep the OSG community informed of their work; a quarterly or semi-­annual
update is encouraged.  The OSG Liaison is responsible for maintaining contact with the project and preparing the updates to the Council.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 3 Projects and their Leader and OSG Liaison:

These two projects are part of the NSF [[http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503256][VOSS (Virtual Organizations as Sociotechnical Systems) Program]]:
   * [[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0943168][Socio-technical Ecosystems for Scientific Software Development]] See also: [[http://conway2.isri.cmu.edu/scisoft-ecosystem-workshop/][CMU-OSG Scientific Software Ecosystems Meeting]] (Jim Herbsleb, Carnegie Mellon) - Jim Weichel (Project Complete)
   * [[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0838383][VOSS: Delegating Organizational Work to Virtual Organization Technologies: Beyond the Communicational Paradigm]] (David Ribes, Georgetown University) - Jim Weichel (Project Complete)
