---++ OSG-GIP Attributes
These attributes correspond to [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/][Glue schema 1.3]] that is proposed for implementation in the OSG 0.8 information systems. For each of the Glue sections below we will be identifying associated attributes, their default values and if we think they are correctly published. We have also identified an initial set of attributes that are considered critical. The attributes are either classified as Critical (C), User Entered (U), Automatic (A) (configure_gip should set the correct value), Not Critical (N) (for now).
