---+Getting Started using TWiki
%TOC%
Only a few simple things are necessary to get started. 
---+++ !!Register to edit pages
First, [[TWiki.TWikiRegistration][Register]]. To edit pages on this twiki site, you must have a registered user name and password. It&#39;s simple, and only takes a minute. This will also create your personal home page. Consult the [[TWiki.WelcomeGuest][Welcome Guest]] which covers the TWiki basics.
---+++ !!Learn to edit topics
*Edit Access control* will be given by the site administrator for editing %MAINWEB% and other topics. While you wait, you can *get started immediately* with the [[Sandbox.WebHome][Sandbox]].  

To edit content, click on the &#39;Edit&#39; button at either the top or bottom of any page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text according to TWiki markup, click &#39;Preview&#39; to see, then (if it looks ok) click &#39;Save&#39;.  Click &quot;Checkpoint&quot; to save while continuing to edit. 
---+++ !!Create new pages
Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord in a topic. Once the topic is saved, the topic-to-be is denoted by a ? after the word. Clicking on the ? to create the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a &#39;topic&#39;).

Another way is to create a TWiki.WikiWord in the &quot;Jump&quot; box, then click &quot;Create&quot; on the page that appears in order to create the new page with the name you entered.

---+++ !!About editing topics
The TWiki is a collaborative work area.  Within pages associated with your area of expertise and/or interest, you should feel free to add information that you think will help, to correct erroneous information, and to delete obsolete information.  (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!
