*What is the OSG?*

The Open Science Grid is a national computing infrastructure for science co-funded by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. By leveraging advanced software technologies, OSG brings together computing and data resources across campus, regional, national and international boundaries. More than 50 independent provider sites from more than 20 states contribute to the power of the OSG.

OSG aims to meet U.S. researchers&#39; growing demand for computing and data transfer and storage capabilities by giving them local access to a powerful national infrastructure.

OSG, which began as a grass-roots endeavor, is an expanding alliance of universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers. Within this diverse group, scientists, students and IT professionals jointly contribute to OSG, share ideas and technologies and reap the benefits of OSG&#39;s distributed computing resources.

*Who uses the OSG?*

OSG is open to and actively works to engage U.S. researchers across the full spectrum of scientific disciplines. Currently, more than 50 institutions use OSG for their computing, processing and data storage needs in fields such as high-energy physics, gravitational wave science, mathematics, bioinformatics, nanotechnology and meteorology.

Members contribute new ways to interface with and extend OSG&#39;s software. Individual research comunities, called Virtual Organizations, use OSG&#39;s common services to meet the unique needs of their communities.

OSG builds bridges between inself and other grids, including the U.S.-based TeraGrid and the European EGEE. By enabling access to computer resources acrsoss multiple grids, OSG allows members to harness resources that span national and international boundaries.

*Facts &amp; figures*

OSG provides resources to scientific endeavors such as the LIGO Gravitational Wave Observatory, DZero experiment data analysis and climate modeling.

Between 2006 and 2007 OSG provided the LHC&#39;s international phyiscs collaborations with 30 percent of their processing cycles. This involved the movement of more than 100 terabytes of data across seven storage sites.

Kuhlman Lab at UNC-Chapel Hill Medical School completed structure predictions for 10 proteins, consuming more than 10,000 CPU-days on OSG.

*Partnership* 

OSG combines the computing power and staff of leading universities and DOE national laboratories. The partnership between two leading institutions of the Open Science Grid, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Fermilab, embodies this collaboration.

UW-Madison&#39;s long tradition of distributed computing research steers OSG&#39;s architectural and operational principles. Technologies and frameworks pioneered by UW enable scientists across the U.S. to access OSG to run large computational tasks over extended periods of time. UW leads OSG software development, packaging and deployment efforts and is home to OSG&#39;s principal investigator and computing facility coordinator.

Fermilab supports particle physics and astrophysics research to determine the origin and nature of the universe. Fermilab&#39;s experience in managing large scientific data sets and providing advanced networking, data stroage and computing resources contributed to OSG&#39;s development. Fermilab hosts one of the largest sets of OSG-dedicated computing resources and is home to the OSG executive director.
