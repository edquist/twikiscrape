Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the staphylococcal nuclease protein residue can twist into another conformation, usually forcing water molecules to leave. But which conformation is adopted and for what proportion of the time? And what happens to the water structure around these conformations? Many more simulations are required to find answers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CDF and DZero results - needs to be redrawn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The limits for the frequency of Bs decay, as determined by the two Tevatron collaborations, CDF and DZero, has changed as measurements become more sensitive to supersymmetry and other new physics. The latest limits are closer to the Standard Model expectation.
