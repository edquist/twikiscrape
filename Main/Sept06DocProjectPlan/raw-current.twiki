---++ List of Tasks and estimated timeframe
Phase I (timescale: 1 week)
   * Complete &quot;docinventory.xml&quot; matrix
   * Define structure/organization of user doc TWiki, and standard editing techniques such that requirements are met

Phase II (timescale: 3 weeks)
   * Convert KBase info to TWiki topics
   * Move/rename existing TWiki topics according to new structure/organization (update intra-Twiki links per Twiki instructions)
   * Identify and update all links to moved/deleted/renamed topic pages to/from OSG website
Phase III (timescale: 3 months)
   * Edit/update existing TWiki topics as necessary  (to be assigned according to expertise)
   * Create new TWiki topics for missing information, per the matrix  (to be assigned according to expertise)
   * Identify external documents to link to, as necessary
   * Create links from main OSG site to TWiki topics as necessary

Additions Nov 13, 06:
   * Update Glossary
   *

---++ Schedule 
In order to create a schedule:
   * Complete docinventory matrix
   * Estimate time for each item on matrix
   * Assign work to individuals (and see how it fits in with their other priorities)

---++ Maintenance
   * Coordinate with new VDT releases
   * Assign one expert (maybe a backup, too) to each topic
   * Expert expected to figure out how the new VDT release changes the doc he/she is responsible for.
   * If minor changes required, expert should make them, and retest doc
   * If significant changes required, expert can coordinate with tech writer to accomplish update and retest.
   * Editor of topic (expert or tech writer) should notify doc activity when update/retest is completed.
   * How best to keep track of what&#39;s updated and what&#39;s still in need?
