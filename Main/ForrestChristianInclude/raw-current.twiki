%STARTINCLUDE%
Here&#39;s the text that I am including in my other page. I put the exact link down below to see what happens. I suppose that one could also put the link over to the right and all that, but I&#39;m too lazy today to do it.

&lt;div class=&quot;twikiSmall&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;%SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
%STOPINCLUDE%


%SEARCH{search=&quot;Meeting&quot; scope=&quot;topic&quot; order=&quot;created&quot; web=&quot;Documentation&quot; nonoise=&quot;on&quot; reverse=&quot;on&quot; header=&quot;&quot; format=&quot;   * [[Documentation.$topic][$topic]]  ($createdate)&quot; }%
