Here are a couple of sample scripts to submit jobs on the OSG. I am assuming that you have the necessary software installed on your desktop. Take a look at the Condor [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.6.10/condor_submit.html manual]] for the submission command to see the definitions of each of these terms (this is for Condor v6.6, and the link could become obsolete as new versions appear). The webpage for Condor manuals is [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual here]].

You will use a command such as *condor_submit [filename]* to submit your job.

1) In this file, you are using the *executable /bin/hostname* on the resource aheposgk.phy2.albany.edu

universe = globus

globusscheduler = aheposgk.phy2.albany.edu/jobmanager-condor

executable = /bin/hostname

output = why_error_21.out

error = why_error_21.err

log = why_error_21.log

notification = never

2) If you want to use your *own executable*, your submission file could look something like. Remember, that in this case, your executable has to be in the same area from where you submit the job.

executable = hello-world2

transfer_executable = true

should_transfer_files = YES

when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT

universe = grid

grid_type = gt2

output = test2_$(cluster).out

log = test2_$(cluster).log

error = test2_$(cluster).err
