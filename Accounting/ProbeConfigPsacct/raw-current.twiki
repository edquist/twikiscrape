---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: PS Accounting
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[ProbeInstallation#DownloadTable][Install]] the software&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&amp;quot;Default&amp;quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.&lt;br /&gt;We recommend a =psacct:cluster_name= such as &quot;psacct:cmswc1.fnal.gov&quot;. |
| !SiteName = &amp;quot;Generic Site&amp;quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !EnableProbe = &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; | If present, this attribute must be set to one to enable probe reporting. |
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in =/etc/cron.d=
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time; this time is randomized.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Unlike other Gratia accounting probes, this probe must be installed on each worker node in addition to the CE. See the [[ProbeInstallation#SourceRpm][notes on building from source rpm]] for a way to simplify the installation on multiple nodes by defining macros.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The !CollectorHost has been pre-configured to use the official OSG Gratia PS-Accounting collector; please verify this configuration before enabling the probe.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If this is the first time you have installed the ps-accounting probe
on this node and you were previously running Fermilab Accountng (facct),
please see the [[FacctToGratiaMigration][notes on migrating from facct to Gratia]].&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
