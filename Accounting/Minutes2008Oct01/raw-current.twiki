---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++v0.38 Release Status.

   * Discovered a problem with build-sumary-view.sql, invoked for new collectors. Comments not marked properly (--- vs --).
      * Chris mysql client version? I haven&#39;t seen this and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve used it before.
      * John: will check.

   * Probes released. Problems discovered in Gratia.py. Fixed. Re-released. 

---++v1.00 Release Status

   * Provisionally set for October 15.

---++DB and Schema issues

   * ZRM v2 installed. Features compress-on-the-fly. ZRM perl script altered to add &quot;--complete-insert&quot; option to mysqldump to add column names to insert statements.
   * Investigation into running ZRM as non-root (UNIX) user -- feasible with permission changes to /etc/mysql-zrm adnd /var/log/mysql-zrm.
   * Diana asked about the possibility of adding the DBA group to the ZRM emails -- Chris will investigate ZRM configuration as opposed to adding DB group to gratia-root, which is not desirable.

---++OSG Issues

   * Working with OIM to get all site associations in site -&gt; Tier 2 federation.
   * Question: how (if) OIM is being used for Gratia site names.
      * Chris: I think it&#39;s being used but only in the cross-check email.
   * Question: possibility of using OIM for VO translations -- esp. capitalization.
      * Chris: can be done on an ad hoc operational basis to edit VO translation table.

---++WLCG

   * This month&#39;s reports from QLCG will be late due to vacations.

---++ Operational news

   * Engage site name translation change.
      * John needs to be made aware of these changes in case they impact WLCG reporting.
      * Dan: can these changes be automagic?
      * Chris &amp; John: possibly; would need to move information from txt file to DB and have triggers to detect changes.

---++Services


---++Reports

   * Penelope: gratiax21:8880 now has reports using only two stored procedures.
      * Working on multi-select.
      * PS-accounting reports to be fixed to used stored procedure.
      * Need help on ranked queries.
      * Problem with current production reports: one or two drillthroughs aren&#39;t selecting the right data. Problem does not exist in new reports.

---++Test Bed

---++Any Other Business

   * Trouble with sourceforge CVS access today. Still not fixed as of 14:10 CDT.
