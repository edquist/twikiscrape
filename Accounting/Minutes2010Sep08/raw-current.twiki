---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

---+Services Operation

Dan Y: &quot;Something&quot; happened last Tuesday with according to web search does seem to happen once in a while ... where the cpu is peg at 98% for one hour ... this lead to the innodb&#39;s queue to grow and to stay there until we rebooted later that morning.

Scott: We saw some alarms at the GOC but it cleared by itself.

Brian: The test was failed is the one that says that the Collector has not received data for one hour.

---+OSG Issues

Scott: All okay on the GOC&#39;s side.

Brian: What&#39;s on your plate?

Philippe: HTPC is next on my plate (putting on hold Status collection improvement).

Brian:  There will be an OSG display using Google earth at SuperComputing (in New Orleans).   They would like data that is similar to the info in the existing osg display.  We will look into reusing the data from there but might need special query for a week.
