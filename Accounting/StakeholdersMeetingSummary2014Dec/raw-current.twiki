---+++ New Requests

---+++ Stakeholder Issues 

---++++Fermi

This is more a OSG GOC issue. 
Gratia tickets from GOC are not coming via SNOW but via email. Rob Q will investigate.


---++++OSG

Concerned about the Gratia + !GratiaWeb stability. Features are OK but the service should scale and be reliable.

R: There have been some bug fixes. More effort is ongoing to fix memory leaks.

Another concern is about the room for growth in the reporting of job records. There is a plan in OSG to report information from all submit hosts.

R: This is not a concern. The number of records could more than double and not cause any load problem.

---++++CMS

Support for the APEL interface seems dwindling. E.g. problems with the UCSD site coming back online recently. 
Data should flow reliably from OSG to APEL to WLCG

R: Gratia is providing the data but is not involved anymore in the APEL interface.
There should be a meeting OSG (Rob Q + Chander) with CMS to understand the boundaries between development and operations
   * OSG (Rob Q) is operating the service (not providing changes/bug fixes/updates)
   * CMS should provide the software development

---++ New Action items

Gratia is migrating to new hardware. This migration will happen at the beginning of 2015.
Joe will keep GOC up to date with the migration plans and communicate all the dates once these are known.

Rob Q. is interested in restarting the discussion about long term plans for Gratia+GratiaWeb. About using new tools like Grafana or XdMOD. A meeting should be scheduled early January.


&lt;br&gt;
Tanya inquired about the possibility to have a big project combining FIFE monitoring, job submission and monitoring, accounting.

Ruth suggested to write an abstract and submit it to SPPM:
whenever ready to talk and present at the meeting Margaret can add the item to the agenda

An important aspect will be [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator][KPI (Key Performance Indicators)]].  
Metrics, how to interpret them, how to present data with some meaning, distinguish what is normal and what not
