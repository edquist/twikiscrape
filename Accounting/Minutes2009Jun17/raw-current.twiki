---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Release Status

Due to vacation and sickness, no major progress in last 3 weeks.

---++Services Operation

---+++OSG/Fermi

Dan: 4 firmware updates needed to be applied to the Gratia development machines (but  updates failed on some machine)
Dan: Needed to replace many of the disks.

Keith: data processing rate (expectations) means that we have no worry for data size on main production machine.

Keith: Hardware upgrade request has been submitted.

---+++RSV

---++OSG 

   * Job per (10) minutes PR Plots .. are we happy we the setup?  Do we still need to consider replication?  Probably not, the internal FermiGrid &#39;replication&#39; should be enough, should it not?

Brian will query the JobUsageRecord_Meta tables every 10 minutes to create a csv file that the OSG PR firm will use to produce a pretty plot.

---++Development/Support

Chris: Helped Brian through bug in his storage probe/collector development.

Chris: Several tickets were discovered languishing in footprint/remedy hell.  They have been cleared/passed on.

Chris: Arvind has updated the RSV probe monitoring the Gratia probes to the lastest RSV api.  He also want to update the probe to be able to be invoked remotely.
