---++Collector/Report development
Jeff: Started to work on weekly report for the OSG Director.  I am recycling some of the existing
reports.  
Philippe: For user based report, we will add a user column to the VOProbeSummary table.
Jeff: I discovered new features in the BIRT support for drill-through.
Philippe: I fixed the height of the bar chart so that they show all of the labels.
Penelope: I fixed several problem with Safari support.  I cleanup the iframe (reducing the number
of useless sliders).  I also added titles to the intermediary pages (request for date information).
And some code cleanup.  I will upload this to the server a little later.
Penelope: I started to look at how to issue .csv.  Birt 2.2. has support for csv files.  So I am 
now working on upgrading to Birt 2.2.  I think we could re-use the birt viewer instead of our own
viewer.  It has a lot of the features that we need/use.
---++Probes
John W.: I fixed the PBS/LSF lock file issue.  The fix was send to the VDT team.  As soon as we
get the installation instruction we will upload them to the doc.
---++Storage Probe
Philippe: dCache Storage is &#39;continuously running&#39; which uncovered a few problems which are
now fixed.  Other probe could now (if they wish) be turn on continuously.
---++Any Other Business
John W.: I am nearly done with the APEL/WLCG uploads, I need to hide the password.  We will
have 2 cron jobs.  One for the previous month (running for about 10 days) and one for the current 
month.  I will do a delete row and replace (instead of update) to handle the case of ExecutingSite 
being renamed.  We will upload all the data we have (even from previous months).
