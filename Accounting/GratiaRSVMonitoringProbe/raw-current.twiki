---+!! Gratia RSV Monitoring Probe

This is a probe written for RSV that examines the Gratia probes on the system and ascertains whether they are reporting properly and can provide some diagnostics if problems are found.

---++ Probe Operation

Under normal circumstances this probe is packaged with the RSV system and is installed on a CE along with all the other RSV probes. It will be executed regularly and its results posted along with those of other probes. It may also be invoked manually and can give better diagnostics if run as root.

---+++ Manual invocation

To invoke manually:

&lt;pre&gt;$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/probes/worker-scripts/gratia-config-probe-helper -p &amp;lt;probe&amp;gt; -X&lt;/pre&gt;

The =-X= option produces human-readable output instead of the default XML. Invoke as root for more diagnostics.
