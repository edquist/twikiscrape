Mine&#39;s tool&#39;s input need to resemble a log file which does not fit the way Gratia archive its incoming record.

Actually the incoming records could be harvested and sent to a log file ...

Penelope: I cleanup all the report to all use the library and accept all the parameters and literals.
Working on reducing the number of store procedure.

Philippe: For firefox 3, we need Birt 2.3.0.

Penelope: I have test 2.3.x with our code and it work so the upgrade should be very simple.

John: Also the reports are hard to test.
