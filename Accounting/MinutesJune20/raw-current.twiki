and we discovered a potential small issue with duplicates.  We are still trying to recover.

Philippe: It is a good thing that we have message loss prevention build it.

Diana: I will try to build a Mysql v5.0.something with SSL enabled.  The v5.1 series is still beta.

Penelope: I am negatively affected by network outage and the DB updates.  I am working on 
the update to Birt 2.2.  I had to pace a bug report because the engine start up is changed.
There are  three different download area for the report engines.  I am quite confused.

Philippe: I will take a look.

John: I update the LCG upload to use the Survey information and updated
the old data accordingly.

John: For Tomcat/SSL connection, we need to get a procedure in place to
update the certs.
