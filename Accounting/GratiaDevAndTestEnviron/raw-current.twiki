---++ Description

The document describes the development and test environment for the Gratia accounting services.

[[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/gratia-development-organization.html][Machine allocation and usage]] is described on the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][Fermigrid]] [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/fermigrid-systems-services.html][Systems and Services]] pages.

---++ Software

In order to insure consistency in the development environment across multiple real/xen nodes, the software packages that are required by Gratia have been stored in the __gratia__ user&#39;s $HOME directory which is shared file file system.

   * =/home/gratia/tomcat-tarballs=: Tomcat tarballs. The latest version is automatically picked up by the =install-release= script.
   * =mysql-gui-tools= may be installed on RHEL5-based systems under /opt as downloaded from the mysql.com site.
   * JRE / JDK and mysql client should be installed from the base distribution.

---++ Daily Builds

Daily builds take place from HEAD, and the mechanism for same is described on the [[GratiaDailyBuilds][Gratia Daily Builds]] page. The locations of the build host, collector and database nodes are described on the !FermiGrid [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/gratia-development-organization.html][machine allocation and usage]] page.

Logs from the daily build may always be found under =~gratia/gratia-builds=, along with the builds themselves.

---++ Daily installs and upgrades

Developers&#39; integration instances are installed from a cron entry on the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/gratia-development-organization.html][nightly build host]] using the [[#Daily_Builds][daily builds]] described in the previous section.

This allows developers to test committed changes on a regular basis.

The daily upgrade is performed using the =install-nightly-builds= script, as found in =gratia/build-scripts=.

Refer to the [[GratiaUpgradeScript][Gratia upgrade script (gratia-upgrade.sh)]] documentation for details on location of log files.  An email notification is sent upon completion (successful or failed).

---++ Installing your own collector.

The main flexible, does-everything-you-might-want-and-more script is the [[GratiaUpgradeScript][Gratia upgrade script (gratia-upgrade.sh)]].

*However*, =gratia/build-scripts= contains a simpler wrapper, [[GratiaInstallReleaseScript][install-release]]. It handles installs on production, development and integration servers of official nightly builds, official releases or local builds; see the link for usage information.


---++ Test Site Grid
 In order to provide a predictable and controlled test environment, a =test= grid site has been established. It will contain all the necessary components of an OSG grid site: 

   * The VOMS service has been populated with several VOs. If you are a member of the Gratia development team, you should have administrative privileges to view any data. 

   * The GUMS service uses the OSG =gums.config= template at this time. So it contains all OSG VOs and memberships as defined by the OSG GOC. At some point, it will be changed to use a =gums.config= file using the =gratiax34= VOMS service. 

   * Several Compute Elements (CE) nodes running the various job batch queue managers (condor and pbs at this time). The authorization modes for these CE&#39;s can be established to use all three of the OSG modes: grid3, compatibility and full privilege. All will derive their membership lists for authorizations from the Gratia VOMS and GUMS servers mentioned above. 

   * at least one Worker Node (WN) with glExec. 

The definitive description of the location of these services may be found on [[http://home.fnal.gov/%7Eweigand/test_nodes/test_nodes.html][John Weigand&#39;s machine usage page]].
