---++ Discussion
   1. We think we have all the requirements for https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-59  and will start working on implementation. We will create a new dev branch for this code modification. John will work and schema modification, schema upgrade script etc. Tanya will look at admin UI modification to handle ProjectNameCorrection table. The rough estimate that it should be ready for testing in 2 months. 
   1. No update on cleanup efforts
   1. It looks like no new changes are required in urCollector to fix pbs-lsf. Suchandra needs to test the production version against lsf and verify that all the changes that have been done for pbs work for lsf. The only availbale ITB LSF installation is on OU but Horst is on vacation until mid June.
   1. Tanya has modified relevant scripts for reporting and committed it to https://gratia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gratia/branches/dev/v1-12-5 and will put in wisc upstream directory. Hyunwoo started working on gratia-service.spec modification to create  gratia-reporting rpm.
   1. The manifestation of the problem if that for some sites CPU duration is exceeding  Wall duration.  There are three problems lumped together in one ticket. One was related to condor bug that is fixed now. Nebraska has upgraded condor so it is unclear if it affected anybody else. The second problem is gratia bug that John will fix. It looks like the gratia views do not take into account multicore jobs. It is unclear why UFlorida-HPC (pbs:osg.hpc.ufl.edu) has the same problem but reports only one core.
