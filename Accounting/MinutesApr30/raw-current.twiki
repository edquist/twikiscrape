---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Collector/Report development

Philippe: Current reports (v0.19) looks pretty.  Performance more than adequate.

Jeff: I am working on updating the Daily reports: I am setting them to be cumulative
and have the same click through behavior. 

Jeff: What should we do about LIGO vs ligo?

Philippe: We should differentiate them.

Chris/Jeff: However the sql &#39;group by&#39; does not distinguish casing.

Philippe: Oups :(.  Then we still need to fix some reports that are distinguishing them.

Penelope:  I uploaded a Report requirement document to the Twiki.

Philippe: We will need to a new field to the tables related to which &#39;Grid&#39; the job
was run on.  In particular, we will have OSG, EGEE and &#39;Local&#39;.

---++Probes

Chris: We need to test the current CVS head and make a release.
And also add a few new feature that were requested.

Philippe: Turns that to distinguish between local job and Grid we can not use
LCG software.  We will need to implement something that call vdt-info and parse
the result.

---++Storage Probe

Philippe: Karthik has started to look the schema for DCache and has some queries
already setup.  I will forward his mail to Chris and Jeff because he will need new 
summary tables.

---++Metrics

John U: The report was upload in osg-docdb.  

Philippe: Ruth needs help with OSG metrics and hopes John W. can help John U with it so he help finish the Gratia test stands.
