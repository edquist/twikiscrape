---++Collector/Report development
   * Penelope
      * The code is now available to download a CSV file: collectors need to be updated.
      * I am investigating how to eliminate iframes, but it&#39;s looking really complicated and I&#39;m running into technical problems; I need to do some more investigations.
      * I&#39;m also looking into our own viewer code: one of our main problems is that our viewer code is often tailored to individual reports -- would like to separate this out if possible, as it is causing us many problems producing new reports and making general changes to all reports.
   * Chris
      * Stored procedure additions for Jeff have been checked in but require further testing; they necessitated a column addition to the VOProbeSummary table.
      * There was an email on the list recently suggesting the use of views in place of summary tables and triggers.
         * John W: you&#39;d still be searching across the whole table -- views save SQL, not time.
      * There was another email on the list talking about &quot;forcing&quot; a particular index to be used as the MySQL parser often makes a non-optimal choice of index to use if it has several from which to choose.
         * Penelope: I&#39;d like to see a test with one query forced, and then again with MySQL left to make the choice.
   * Penelope: memory resident tables for access speed?
      * Chris: doesn&#39;t sound scalable, even with table surgery (splitting off XML columns to a different table).
   * John W: do we need reports to be timely at all? Can we not just update summary tables once per day?

---++Probes
   * Chris: problems reported with SGE probe: updates from authors in repository and awaiting testing of Gratia.py before 
---++Storage Probe
   * No news this week.

&lt;LI /&gt; Gratia production machines

    Steve mailed an updated upgrade procedure document to Chris and Philippe. Basically, on 2007/04/10, The following actions will be taken:

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI /&gt; Aliases moved effective morning of April 10:
&lt;OL style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
&lt;LI /&gt; gratia-fermi (currently points to cd-psg2) will point to gratia08;
&lt;LI /&gt; gratia-fermi-itb will point to gratia08;
&lt;LI /&gt; gratia-psacct will point to gratia08;
&lt;LI /&gt; gratia-osg.fnal.gov (currently points to cd-psg2) will point to gratia09;
&lt;LI /&gt; gratia.opensciencegrid.org (currently points to cd-psg8) will point to gratia09;
&lt;LI /&gt; gratia-osg-itb.fnal.gov will point to gratia09.
&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;LI /&gt; cd-psg6 will be changed to gratia06 and new disks will be installed. Data will be destroyed but the database should have been moved to gratia07 by this time.
&lt;/OL&gt;

Other actions are planned for the development machines, but they are not germane to this discussion.

Prerequisites:
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI /&gt; Latest tomcat and gratia collectors must be installed on gratia08, gratia09;
&lt;LI /&gt; Latest mysql must be installed on gratia07;
&lt;LI /&gt; Mechanism to sync existing data from cd-psg6 to gratia07 developed and repeatedly tested -- mysqlhotcopy should work but needs testing.
&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;

Action items based on prerequisites:
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT /&gt; Chris
&lt;DD /&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI /&gt; Produce a well tested procedure for obtaining a good version of tomcat and loading a known release of the Gratia collector software;
&lt;LI /&gt; Try to ascertain if anyone is still trying to access the collectors by their non-generic names.
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;DT /&gt;Steve
&lt;DD /&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI /&gt; Install mysql on gratia07;
&lt;LI /&gt; Investigate mysqlhotcopy and come up with a data migration plan from cd-psg6 to gratia07 and back to gratia06;
&lt;LI /&gt; Test and OK and implement Chris&#39; procedure for tomcat and collector load on gratia08 and gratia09.
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;/DL&gt;
