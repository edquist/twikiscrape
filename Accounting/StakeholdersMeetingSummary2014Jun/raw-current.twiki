---+++ Stakeholder Issues 
---++++Fermi

There is a requirement for authenticated users 
   * some of the VO (external users) will not like to have their information to be available
   * the storage group may not like to know how many customers it has

This means that:
   * there will be need for user access and privileges for specific data
   * some gatekeeper to check authentication and access rights

Current status: 
   * currently the gratia DB and GratiaWeb are open for read (for everyone)
   * A dedicated collector/DB will solve the problem for DB access
   * A GUI making controlled access will need development (GratiaWeb does not provide user authentication and also an authenticated web server would not be able to give access to different data to different users)

Marco will attend the Active Archive Facility Project, and Steering Committee Meeting on Tuesday to brainstorm on accounting

Ruth suggested to check also with other Gratia stakeholders if they could benefit form the changes for the Archival project:
talk with CMS and BNL to ask if this new information (new storage information) is useful to them.

---++++OSG

   * There will be need for additional queries
   * As Bo digs in the data OSG will find more data inconsistencies
   * Concerned on the OSG ownership of the OSG Gratia instance. There must be some way to control 

Reply: 
   * the instance is dedicated to OSG
   * there is no authentication system stopping malicious or mistaken users from writing into it
   * currently we can do some controls/checks on the data but a malicious user forging data could send something undistinguishable from a legitimate probe
   * an authentication mechanism exists but there were scalability concerns and was never used/tested
   * anything more will require some development

Probably an offline discussion/clarification is needed as suggested by Ruth
