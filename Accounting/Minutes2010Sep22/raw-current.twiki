---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

---+Services Operation

Dan: Because of the network outage, the collector vm were rebooted.   One of the reporter ip was not pointing to the right collector.   The housekeeping unfortunately turned itself back on and induce noticeable delays.    Disk space is 30% full (1 out of 3 TB) so we still have some time but not much.

Derek: I would like to have some data extract (semi-live) for the SuperComputing.

Keith: There are issue of timeout and we are leery of adding any load to the current version of Gratia, any additional recurrent query would need change management approval.

   1.  Deployment of the new Gratia software that has the housekeeping circuit breaker fix.
   2.  Demonstrated stable operation of the above version.
   3.  Deployment of the code fixes on the OSG &quot;Live&quot; Display and the Gratia RSV probe to address WAN timeouts when remote accessing the Gratia MySQL databases.
   4.  Formal signoff by OSG Management for this request and the formal acceptance of any and all risk that may arise by this change.

Alternatives:

   1.  FermiGrid will configure the Gratia databases to replicate to one or more systems of the OSG&#39;s choosing, and the requested queries may be made &quot;locally&quot;.
   2.  The requested software shall be provided to FermiGrid, and such software will be run locally to FermiGrid.  OSG shall agree that any effort required to accomplish this by FermiGrid personnel may be charged to the &quot;OSG Services&quot; effort reporting category.

No matter what is chosen, the change must be formally processed through the Fermilab change management process.

Philippe: I recommend that you use a gratia-replicated collector this would insulate you the most. 

Derek: I will contact my local admin to see what they can do.

Philippe: If you come up with good queries using the daily data, I will help you transform them into 10 minutes query.

Derek: Sounds good I will look into the reporter and come up with queries.
