Database backup scheme?  Mysql 5.1.10+ support table partitions but is still beta.
Data management, who does it in the long run?

Steve: I am adding xen instances on gratia03 and 05

Steve: no, I am setting up gratia05 to have larger disks adequate for dbs.

All: ... discussion on the detail of the xen vms organization ...

Backup:  ... we shall used partitioning of table when MySQL 5.1 becomes production ...
We should also check &#39;replication&#39;.

---++Collector

---++Report development

Penelope: We shall meet with the OSG directory to discuss reports possible on Friday afternoon.

John U: I have a request get a list of active user per VO.  

Philippe/Jeff: Yes you can write a simple query that give this information.

Penelope: I am working on reorganizing the source code to simply the deployment
and the use within eclipse.

---++Probes

Chris: The glexec team asked us to take over the deployment/distribution of their
probe so that all Gratia probe have a common known environment when deployed.

Chris: I am working on a relase of the probes which includes the glexec.

Chris: I have been tracking 2 site problems.  One was the case where the site
is running Condor 6.9 and they installed OSG 0.6.0, it wiped out their custom
installation of the Condor 6.9 Gratia Probe.  [In addition they ended up using the 
wrong condor configuration]

The 2nd problem is a PBS sites which was ending producing incorrect/broken 
xml files which prevents the upload.  

---++Storage Probe

---++Test Bed

John W.: I need to modify my installation script to add Gram Auditing.
I am also working on a clean environment for probes.  I tried a tool to
get the DB diagram but it does not yet connect to the DB.

Philippe: yes this tool require a default port ... maybe we just need to
recompile it.
