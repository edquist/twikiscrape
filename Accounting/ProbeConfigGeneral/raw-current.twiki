---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: general notes

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;[[ProbeInstallation#DownloadTable][Install]] the software
&lt;LI&gt;Install a specific probe such as [[ProbeInstallation#ProbeDownloadCondor][gratia-probe-condor]] or
[[ProbeInstallation#ProbeDownloadPsacct][gratia-probe-psacct]]; or write your own based on samplemeter.pl or
samplemeter.py.
&lt;LI&gt;Customize the gratia =ProbeConfig= files for each probe, initializing
from =ProbeTemplate= if necessary. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&amp;quot;Default&amp;quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.&lt;br /&gt;We recommend a =batchsystem:FQDN= such as &quot;condor:fermigrid1.fnal.gov&quot;. |
| !SiteName = &amp;quot;Generic Site&amp;quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !VDTSetupFile = &amp;quot;&lt;tt&gt;MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION&lt;/tt&gt;/setup.sh&amp;quot; |Path to the VDT =setup.sh= file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |

&lt;LI&gt;For official Gratia-packaged probe RPMS, the !CollectorHost is configured
appropriately; for your own probe, please contact
osg-accounting@opensciencegrid.org.

&lt;LI&gt;Please note: if you are installing over or upgrading an existing Gratia probe package:
   * Your old configuration may be in a different place and settings may need to be transferred manually.
   * If there exists a  =ProbeConfig=  file in the right place already, the new configuration will be created as =ProbeConfig.rpmnew.= Please review and incorporate changes as appropriate.
&lt;/OL&gt;
