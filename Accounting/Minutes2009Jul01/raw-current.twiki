---++Release Status

- v1.04 Collector and Probe has been released (including to the VDT) and install on both the Fermi and OSG collectors.

It includes authentication but does not include the ability for the probe to talk to the collector via an http_proxy.

One issue was discovered with the new release, during an upgrade if the user try to look at the an admin page before
the upgrade is finish, there will be an exception in the log file which look &#39;bad&#39; but is actually innocuous.
