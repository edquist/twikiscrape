---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

---+Services Operation

Chris:  Tuesday afternoon&#39;s site wide outage did (of course) affect the Gratia collector.   At max, they were down for 3 hours (12:30 on)

Chris: The Fermi collector was a bit slower to come up (due to a quirk in the xen configuration).

Chris: Next thursday there will be a database outage of 3 or 4 hours (for input only), report will be accessible but not updated.
On the following Tuesday, there will be a switch (network address) with an outage of no more than 5 minutes.

---++OSG/Fermi

---++RSV

---+OSG Issues

Brian: We need somebody from Gratia operation to be attending the OSG Operations&#39; meeting.

Keith: Steve Timm already represents Gratia operations at the OSG Operations meeting.

Brian: From meeting on Monday.  There used to be a Panda probe sending summary data.   There are now interested in storing job level information from Panda into a collector.  

---+WLCG 

---+Fermi/CD
 
Project (at least for this year) has been canceled.    (A large fraction of the data requested from the project is already available from FermiGrid monitoring).

---+Developments

---++Report Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Extensions(Karthik).

Karthik: I am encountered many trouble in upgrading an existing schema.  I working through them.  I estimate I am getting quite close.

---++Testing framework (Aaron)

Aaron: Still working on incorporating the test into the VDT testsuite and using (now) the jobmanager/globus submission and finding a way to make sure that the job submitted is the same as the job being &#39;checked&#39;.   I am noticed that some job submission take longer than other.   

Discussion ensued on trying to figure out if you can tag a job in any way when submitted to find it back in the Gratia database.

Chris; In summary, from inside the job, you might be able to grab the id out of one of the log file (this won&#39;t be easy) and pass that through the job&#39;s log.

---+Any Other Business
