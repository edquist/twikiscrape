---++Live minutes
---+++ Objectives and expectations.

Philippe: Agreements between OSG and Gratia project; need to
understand especially OSG expectations for user interface; and for
data storage requirements.

Keith: Internal sanity monitoring for Gratia service. DB monitoring?

Ruth: three parts to the project: Gratia external project; operation &amp;
administration of infrastructure; OSG.

Igor: understand requirements and expectations for interface; data
capacity and lifetime; performance; way for people to access data
directly.

Karthik: want to understand how my skill set fits into the best
interests of the project. Also want to get an understanding of the
&quot;big picture.&quot;

Brian: would like to understand interpoerability with CMS needs; and
progress storage objectives.

Ruth: what is Karthik&#39;s line management / funding?  

Karthik: Mike Stross. I have already discussed with them and are happy
to contribute to OSG. To be considered an USAtlas contribution to OSG,
and therefore an OSG contribution to Gratia; I am working also on
Panda.

Ruth: What are Karthik&#39;s travel restrictions?

Karthik: Apart from vacation from November 15 to end of calendar year,
things are relatively free; would be able to (eg) come to FNAL for a
week at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
---+++ Report interface.

Live display: click-through; full range of selection.

Non-sql custom query interface.

Fixed Display: update regularly; no DB access; &lt;one more&gt;

Email reports: request for more reports; request for permanent access
to previous reports. OSG-ACCOUNTING-INFO is already archived at
http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-accounting-info.html.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discussion regarding current capabilities for DB updates; discussion
of MyISAM -&gt; INNODB penalties: 150K -&gt; 50K (ish).

Brian: suggestion to consider bulk inserts to recover rate.

Action item: to understand requirements from OSG regarding increases
in rate, data and reporting requirements over the next four years.

Action item: to get technical advice and understand how to satisfy the
requirements. OSG would be okay with using OracleDBMS for the central
system provided freeware is available and supported for satellite
sites.

General discussion: accounting vs monitoring. Gratia is not
(currently) a monitoring solution. Discussion of RSV. No guarantee of latency.

Local instances for local site monitoring?

Brian: want to configure granularity. By-hour for a week, by-day
beyond that. Query time may become problematic.

Ruth: local site DB would solve query time problems.

Philippe: lifetime of high-granularity data: year, maybe?

Ruth: need to make sure we factor read requirements into data and
transaction rate -- mirroring to VOs, sites, etc.

Chander: do we need a recommendation of implementation of collectors,
mirroring, etc.?

Ruth: Yes.

Concensus: replication should be one way only; &quot;non-essential&quot;
replication should not compromise primary capability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Birt 2.2 discussion.

MISWEB vs Gratia -- &quot;clickable schema&quot;?

Want &quot;last-week&quot; type report links that always update.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanisms for feedback: UG meetings (Chris G) and site meetings (Rob G).

Whose responsibility for outreach?

On agenda once per month?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reports: navigation? Too much jargon -- technically-oriented
menu. More targetted menu / sub-pages?

Does OSG need reporting by logical groups?

What would the mechanism be for collection and maintenance of said groups?

Ability for &quot;users&quot; (suitably authenticated and authorized) to define
and maintain groups?
