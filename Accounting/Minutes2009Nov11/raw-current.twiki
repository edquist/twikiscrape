---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

Chris: Working on finishing up 1.06.11 which includes better bounding of the replication threads (both in number of threads and amount of data being uploaded at once) and prevention of the RecordProcessor from being stopped by odd looking data.

Chris: Working on releasing the Probe with an update for support of Condor 7.3.2 and 7.4.0.   Add code preventing upload of overlarge records.   Fix for SunGridEngine.

---+Services Operation

---++OSG/Fermi

Chris: osg-itb was bouncing last week due to being slowed down by replication (too many threads).

Dan: About ready to start doing Gratia things on the new hardware.

Chris: gratia09 (the main DB) threw a fit last Friday (auto-reboot through a machine check exception).

Dan: The Fermi database would be turnoff for several hours sometimes in the next few days.

---+OSG Issues

Brian: In the case of an error condition in the hadoop probe, there was a case where the amount was very large.   I updated the probe to trim the output in that case.  I would like to release the probe.

Chris: Yes we are about to make a release.

Chris: Now about Condor ... 7.3.2 and 7.4.0 have arbitrarily decide to change the semantic and format of the x509 entry in the ClassAd; there exist a work-around (now used in GLOW); US CMS T1 can not upgrade to 7.4.0 but will upgrade the condor Gratia probe.   Plus this morning we discovered that there is a new set of file produced by Condor in the Gratia directory, the new files are similar but different from the existing one ; for now (pending more investigation from Alain Roy) we will just clean up the &#39;new&#39; file without using them.   For 7.4.1, they will revert the x509 back to the original means and add new field(s?) for the main FQAN and for the complete set of FQAN.

---+WLCG 

---+Fermi/CD

---+Developments

---++BOINC probe (Sebastian G.)

Brian: Progress is being made.  Even helped found a serious bug in the Collector.  

Brian: I also found bug in the replication code.  I will send the patch to Chris.

---++Report Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Extensions(Karthik).

Karthik: I am far ahead in the upgrade the efficiency report for using the number of Cores.

I will soon get back to the transfer report to add the summary; I am expecting more feedback from Brian.

Brian: The issue is resolved ; one of the protocol was bringing down the average.

Karthik: What about the field of Science.

Brian: I will check with Ruth what she wants.

---++FNAL/Nebraska extension proposal (Brian)

---++Testing framework (Aaron)

Aaron: I am in contact with Alain and Suchandra and I am learning how to do/set the configuration.   My CE was reporting to the osg-itb rather than the development collector.   I have noticed than I submit a job it increments the queue size and it does not make it to the database.   I will go over the RSV probe.   I will cross-check that everything is working fine over the next couple of days.  And recontact Alain then.
