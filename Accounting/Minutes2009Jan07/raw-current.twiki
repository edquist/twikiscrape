---++Services Operation

---+++RSV
Arvind: DB completely upgraded.  DB was physically separated from OIM DB.  As of yesterday, the last few reporting tools have been upgraded to support this separation. 
(now back to full working order for the 1st time since Dec 13).
Arvind: After a few more backups and check, we will turn on the Gratia feature that allow the scrubbing/bookkeeping of the Metric Record ... and hence avoid the DB from growing to big.

Mine: Why are the 2 DB now on 2 separate nodes.

Arvind: Semantically OIM and RSV are 2 different software and have 2 different use.  OIM is critical to operation and should not be bogged down by the RSV db usage.

Philippe:  What is the status of the RSV probe of the Gratia Accounting Probes.

Chris: First version was finished last month.  Alain has provided several comments.  One real issue is that the RSV probe is not intended to be run as root.  This makes it less informative (can&#39;t look at the crontab).

Arvind: In RSV, we have several case where we need to check/monitor that need root, we make the things being monitored write helper log files.

Rob: We could also have the probe points to the way to get more information on the reason for failures (and this extra step can required to be run a root).

Chris: Sounds good, I will update the probe to only do (some of) the check when ran as non-root and do them if run as root.

Chris: I would like to mark as Critical the case where it is not reporting.

Arvind: I agree with Chris.

Rob: Be careful to not tune it to sensitive [too many critical report tend to lead to ignore].

Chris: Critical: non in crontab, not enabled, not have a properly set metername or server/Collector has never seen any. 

Brian: We should discuss the details on the exact level of the warnings off line.

Chris: alright.               
 
---+++OSG/Fermi

Keith: What about the security issues?

Chris: We put mitigation in place immediately.

---++OIM

Brian: Let&#39;s discuss the outstanding list.

Arvind: There is a question of privacy.  Currently only privileged staff has access to the user level information.

Chris: I could obtain a service certificate.  

Rob/Chris/Arvind: options includes certificate and firewalls.

Arvind: We need to discuss the exact detail further, in the meantime, we could provide an obfuscated URL. 

Chris: One wrinkle about the FQAN translation, it would be nice to be able to be able to have the user to select the set of reports only based on the pretty name.

Arvind/Chris: There is more discussion needed.

Mine: Can the list of test of the RSV probe of the Gratia Accounting Probes and their criticality be documented somewhere?

Chris: Of course ;)

---++Release Status

   * RSV Probe of Gratia
   * Testing of Gratia probe on PBS [was done].
   * OIM
http://code.google.com/p/osggoc/issues/detail?id=4

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMWishList 

---++OSG 

   * Steve Clark vs NotreDame ... this is probably a bug in the SunGridEngine probe (takes the common name from the gridmapfile).  The format of the gridmapfile seems to not quite be the one expected by the probe (plus one existing bug we fix but have not release the patch).
Chris is following through.

Keith: We might have an SGE thingy at Fermilab.

   * Transfer and Storage deployment.

Keith: The Storage probe seems to be login without a certificate into the SE (actually the actual CONTROL interface).  
Brian: OSG has not yet specified the requirement for Storage Allocation.

Philippe: Do we need the Storage Probe?

Mine: I will check.

Philippe/Brian:  However if you need it, the Storage problem probably need to be rewritten.

Brian/Philippe: Let&#39;s get together to write down a list of site we are targeting for early adoption of the probe and/or for Collector install.

Brian:  Here is a list of sites:
Purdue-RCAC
Nebraska (done)
CIT_CMS_T2
UCSDT2
MIT
UFlorida-PG
GLOW
