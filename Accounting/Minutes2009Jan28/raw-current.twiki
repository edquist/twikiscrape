---+ Gratia
---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Release Status

Release v1.02 is almost ready, waiting on Chris&#39; time and on Dan to have set the alias.
Should be on Monday.

---++Services Operation

---+++OSG/Fermi

Keith: Naming of the sub-group and the reporting.

After discussion, so somehow OIM need to __also__ provide a reporting name for each VO and sub-groups.

Chris: This is already available (https://oim.grid.iu.edu/pub/misc/vo_reporting_contacts.php).  We will need to update the email report to use this other information.

Keith: Please note that the FQAN will depend on the version of VOMS being run.
So the question is wether the match should be an equality or a &#39;begin with&#39;.

Chris: Yes it is an open question on whether this is an open match or something more flexible (SQL wildcards).

Mine; I will send you a relevant wildcard vs FQAN rules from EGEE.

---+++RSV

---++OSG 

   * FP Remedy interface.

There have been problem that will be fixed when Gratia Developer and/or FermiGrid is registered as a &quot;support center&quot;.   Discussion between Chris and Dan needed to clarify.

   * 15k jobs in December with records with NULL WallDuration. Probably mostly local. Problem fixed in probe and collector for upcoming release. Question of whether to retrofit existing job level data?

The actually number of missing jobs is quite small so we will not restate.

   * Priority of implementing ApplicationExitCode in web interface?

After much discussion back and forth, the conclusion was that  OSG need to be clear the exact requirement and who does work in what tool  and the prioritization of other work.

Ruth: Brian and Frank are expecting to work on the Storage Requirement by the 1st of March.

Chris: OIM issue resolved or being resolved.  The VO and Site report are ready to go.  
Per reporting name report selection is not yet ready (need OIM update).
1st Site report(s) will go out on Monday.

---++WLCG 

ras

---++Fermi/CD

Core Service CD Accounting Project being kicked off.

---++Development
---+++VO / Site reports and related OIM upgrades.

---++Probes

Chris: Atlas lost 76K and DZero 5.5K and 16.5K for December and January due to the PBS probe bug (ie. ignoring jobs above 100 hours).

Keith: there is a task force to try to improve the efficiency; so we may come back to ask for reprocessing (unlikely).

---++Any Other Business

---++To be discussed later:
---+ Log Files and Monitoring Activity

Ruth: The reason to restart this are :
   * Ian Stoke Rees was unable to understand where/why its jobs failed (at USCD).  There was/is no tools method to even investigate this.  [The bottom line end up being that the file permission on 1 out 3000 nodes at USCD was incorrect].   We should have had some way to help Ian understand the issues.
   * There has been several request where of the type &quot;give me log files&quot; and I will help you interpret them.
   * CEDPS troubleshooting, we are one of the main customer -- they have netlogger, syslogng, etc.  --  Troubleshooting used to be in Security in OSG blueprint -- The only transport mechanism we have about log file is Gratia -- DZero is also asking.

Doug was supposed to stop by; 
CD decided Philippe might work on this in April.

Goal: understanding communication and documentation;  Look at what we have, understand the scope and the need and finally make a blueprint proposal of what could be done to solve it.

Chris: The biggest impediment to diagnosis a large class of job failure is the case where stdout/stderr are NOT being send back to you -- and no attempt is being made to sequester the logs - 

Ruth: There is a new feature where Condor can send its log to the dashboard.

Andrew: Who can I talk to about the way troubleshooting could/should be done.

Answer:  Steve Timm, Chris Green, Mine Atlunay, Igor Sfiligoi. (from Fermi), Torre Wenaus, Frank Wutherwein (sp?), Sanjay.

Ruth: Aaron will work on the Monitoring side.

Ruth: If Aaron and Andrew work for more than 6 months together, I will pay everybody beer.
