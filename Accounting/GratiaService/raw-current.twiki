---++ Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
 The ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the Gratia database can be see in the formats listed below. It should be noted that it is not a &quot;complete&quot; picture of all the relationships. Many of the foreign key relationships were deliberately left off in order to simplify the diagram. The intent is to show the main parent/child relationships only.

The software used to maintain the ERD diagram is called _DeZign for Databases Professional Version 4.2.0_ from Datanamic Solutions BV (http://www.datanamic.com). The source file for the various versions is in the Gratia CVS repository in _./gratia/docs/erd_ :
