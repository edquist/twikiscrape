---++VDT Releases.
Philippe:
Thanks to the hard work of John W, Chris G, Alan Roy, and the rest of the VTB participants, we resolve the last remaining issue in the Probe Packaging.

---++Test stand
John W: I should get to it sometime next week (due to ITB work shop).
Philippe: Any change to get Condor 6.9.2 running in a test bed
John W: I may be able to get it down earlier using the production stack.
Chris: We will also need a running example of WS and glexec.

---++Collector
Philippe: Did we apply for &#39;gratia.opensciencegrid.org&#39;?
Chris: Steve Timm should eventually take care of it
Philippe: This was request by the DCache Gratia Probe packager so that they can put the final name.

Philippe: We met Fermigrid and they have develop a plan for transition to production. 
The main action item is to have a clear &#39;cut realease/deployment&#39; plan for each release once we move to fermigrid support production.

Greg: Will you still have total access to the Database.
Philippe: Yes but when start deploying the database on remote site, we will need to relying fully on script and using the
schema version we stored in the database to update the schema (part but not all is already maintain via Hibernate)

Greg: Clustering and Performance.
Running on the same machine I can do a direct 4 columns sql insert of 100000 in 106s.
The JobUsageRecord implies 8 to 10 insert statement.  This commensurate with the 340000 record per hour we have achieve.

Chris: Hence the bottleneck is the database.

Greg: MyISAM to InnoDB lead to 20% improvement -&gt; increase I/O utilization.  InnoDB does row level locking.

Philippe: We could also consider the non-modifiable MySQL back-end.

Jeff:  However, so far, we have had to &#39;fix&#39; the data following bug/problem in the probe or collector.

Philippe:  We may then have to switch from &#39;modify&#39; to add and invalidate.

Greg: The only thing I can think to improve is to use &#39;partitioning&#39;.  In other word we would need extra help to break this number when get closer to it in production.

Roles: 

Greg: I have made an admin page and the code is in place.  I still need to add a little bit of documentation
Chris: We are talking to Tanya&#39;s group, we agreed that implement a server side solution is preferable (aka easier on the user) that the browser side.
Chris: The tools names GridSite requires a firefox plugin/extension and for the user to upload a voms-proxy (and would require apache on the server side).

Probe Status upload:  

Greg: Code is there and i need to show/review the code.

Server Status Query:

Greg: I have basic version and I still need to add a &#39;post&#39; for more detailed queries.

----++Report development

We have new daily report on the status (succeed/fail) of the job.  For Condor it uses
the &#39;ExitStatus&#39; which oddly enough is claimed to be deprecated by the Condor documentation
(I think I should use ExitCode but it seems to always be 0).

Jeff: We updated the server to fix the drill-through.

Philippe: We need to add some meta information to know the type of the record (Job Level
Batch record, Data Transfer (DCache), Storage Record.

Chris: We could add this as part of the hand shake between probe and collector and store
this in a Probe Info table ... 

Philippe: Chris, Greg and Philippe will discuss this further off-line.

Penelope: I am looking at the problem with have with Safari.  They seem to have to 
do with obsolete html tags (like height).  

Penelope: I am also working on Birt 2.2.  

---++Psacct reports.

Jeff: All the report where Probe based but they should be facility based.
The % utilisation chart is based on the node summary and does not seem to 
report correct result.

---++Probes
Philippe: The Condor 6.9.2 Gratia Probe still need to be looked at :(
       
Philippe: We have a request from the security team to get the DN even for PBS/LSF.

Chris: I am making progress on allowing (optionally) to disable the sending of the
data for non-grid job.

---++Storage Probe
DCache.  Might Requires mod to the table schema and to the reports.
---++Metrics
John U: I am in contact with Cern to get direct access to the MonaLisa sql datatabase.

---++Any Other Business

All of CMS is now reporting to Gratia.
