---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++DB and Schema issues

Diana: Still targeting Aug 7th to start looking at InnoDB transition.  

Diana/Chris: There are issue with the length of time the translation might take.

Philippe: What about simply using our replication technology to populate an
empty InnoDB database.

Chris/Philippe: Could Diana recommend which back end engine to go with
and with which configuration?

Chris: Should we change the ordering of the table insertion to do the xml
upload first?

Philippe: maybe.

Chris: Could the hibernate expert look into setting the default character set.

---++Collector/Report development

Jeff: I am finished with the report consolidation.

Chris: Can you remove the old stored procedure.

Jeff: I am now setup with a Birt 2.2 test environment and will start testing.
I did a few conversation, and ran into one puzzling problem, one of the time
based reports (the char element) was not converted properly.
Kathik is making progress (having some trouble with eclipse/cvs at the moment).

Jeff: The Birt tag library will be every helpful is redesigning the interface

Jeff: We will start meeting with OSG regurlaly starting Aug 2nd.

Chris: We send a lot of tickets to GOC about non-reporting sites.
Quite a few of the tickets are already resolved.
A couple were due to very low traffic sites, for those we need to
implement the probe/collector hand shaking.
Most of the problems were due to either the pacman update bug
(which turn off Gratia probe) or obsolete gatekeepers.

Chris: I am improving the look and ordering of the Probe administration
page.
