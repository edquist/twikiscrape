---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

Chris:

Release is held pending trace-and-fix of possible contention problem
with Origin handling. Bug is proving extremely hard to trace.

---+Services Operation

Dan:
Project plan developed, refined.

New admin (Faarooq) coming up to speed.

New machines being burned in and configured.

KVM vs Xen being discussed. Return on investment vs total headache
currently being evaluated.

Still looking at schedule of beginning to middle of November for
cutover.

---++OSG/Fermi

---++RSV

---+OSG Issues

Brian:

Unresolved collector issues (1.02).

Changing firefly over to filter out local jobs.

RSV probe is running at Nebraska.

configure-osg-rsv is going away in favor of rsv-control, modeled on
vdt-control. rsv-control is not small.


---+WLCG 

---+Fermi/CD

---+Developments

---++DN summarization (John Hover)

John Hover&#39;s work is finished and tested except for changing the WLCG
reports.

(After discussion): report changes should be simple and can be done and
tested out-of-band with collector release. Care needs to be taken with
timing of collector install relative to upgrade of reports in
production: reports cannot be upgraded before the 16th of the month
*following* the collector upgrade. Therefore the earliest date for
deployment of the new reports is 2009/11/16 *provided* the collector was
upgraded no later than 2009/10/31.
