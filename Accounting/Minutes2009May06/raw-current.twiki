---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Release Status

Release v1.04: Collector is featured complete.   (However there is no support for certificate signed by the collector under a VDT installation, the &#39;only&#39; case this affect is a site that installed a collector via VDT, requires authenticated connection and run glexec and is not able to install certificate (or proxy certificate (like fermigrid does)) on each of the nodes).   Note that connection can be &#39;refused&#39; just on the basis of host/probename).

Chris: However there is an issue on the way the servlets receiving the incoming connection handles the log4j file rotations.  It leads to a breakdown of a servlets than is then &#39;tied&#39; to the a specific site that is then no longer reporting.

Probe is not still waiting on implementing connecting to the collector via a web proxy (which is needed by BNL).

---++OSG 

Brian: After struggling with the broken VDT installation, the secondary Nebraska collector is setup and ready to receive the information.

Chris: Yes, the issue is understood.  The tar creation was inadequate for the new location of hibernate files. (and a couple of other things).  We need to make sure the 2 tar files are consistent.   The VDT package for services is not standalone (i.e. it also requires the reporting).   We should separate the gratia directory as a separate directory.

Brian: There was a problem with hibernate writing to /tmp and /tmp not been accessible.

Philippe:  This sounds like a node/os configuration issue.

Brian: Have you been given a alternative to the url you are using from OIM for reporting?

Chris: No not yet.   I am concerned about the dateline for the release of OIM v2 slipping due to my unavailability for the next 10 days.
As of the current state, the reports (which uses the contact information out of OIM) will break if OIM v2 replace the current one.

Rob: It might actually be here but there might be a problem with the/your certificate.

Brian: What is the status of the (priority of the) storage accounting work.

Ruth: Brian, Philippe and I need to discuss. 

Brian: What about the transfer reports?

Philippe:  There are at least 5 calendar weeks away.

---++WLCG 

Philippe: No clear answer.

---+++BOINC probe development.

Brian: What about the BOINC probe?

Chris: Sebastian has the list of information the probe should provide and is contacting Condor to see how to get the information out of condor.

---++Any Other Business

---++To be discussed later:

---+ Log Files and Monitoring Activity
