---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Collector/Report development

   * Jeff: I have fixed the problem with the ranked usage reports that had 9 VOs in some plots. In addition, I have added one level of drill-through to the plots.
   * Jeff: I am also working on consolidating some of the reports and stored procedures into multi-purpose routines to reduce their number.
   * Jeff: I have been talking to Chris about a problem with editing stored procedures within mysql-query-browser: it is only possible to do this (if at all) as the same user *and* location under which the procedures were uploaded originally despite having all applicable privileges on the schema.
      * Chris: I&#39;m stumped.
      * John W: I will take a look.
   * Chris: I have uploaded a test release to =gratia-vm02= for Margherite. It has been populated by replication from the production collector and has several 100K entries. I still need to provide build and install instructions for Margherite for her own testing.
      * John: Will Margherite need a OSG client or CE install?
      * Chris: I don&#39;t believe so: a couple of libraries may be needed to talk to VOMS but these should be self-contained and shipped with the release.
      * John W: It may help to have a VOMS server running for test purposes to avoid having to obtain multiple registrations, etc, for testing.

---++Probes

   * Chris: the glexec has been been subsumed into the Gratia repository and RPM set. Still needs to be tested on ITB nodes before being farmed out to production.
   * Chris: In addition, the RPM configuration has been changed to write configuration files specifying the FNAL-specific collectors =gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:888[01]= instead of the production ones.
   * Chris: We have also been requested to move from using =/etc/crontab= to =/etc/cron.d/gratia-probe= (say). This will be done, but not immediately.
   * Chris: We have been dealing with some PBS log-parsing errors which result in extremely large CPU and/or !WallTimes (of order the number of seconds since 1970) for a record. Manually expunging these records is painful and we need a new set of triggers to handle changes to the summary tables when a !JobUsageRecord is corrected or removed. I have requested PBS/LSF logs from 5 sites, of which I have received 4. Some of these sites exhibited this problem; others showed problems obtaining the number of processors for MPI jobs with certain PBS configurations. The logs should enable us to improve the EGEE probe to fix these problems.
      * Penelope: Can these corrupt records be detected before being entered in the table?
      * Chris: In some cases yes, but not necessarily in all. We need some way of automatically correcting the summary tables without blowing them away and regenerating from scratch, which is the only method currently.

---++Storage Probe

---++Test Bed

   * John W: I have been getting John U up to speed.

---++Metrics

---++Any Other Business

   * Chris (Not discussed at meeting): Gratia is being fingered as a solution for security auditing, with altered/new  probes and/or tables. Project is still in feasibility and requirements stage.
