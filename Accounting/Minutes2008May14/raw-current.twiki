---++Action items from previous meeting:

Steve: We have placed the req for extra disk and console controller for the Gratia Hardware

Steve: I still need to work-out the plan for long term storage of the historical data.

---++v0.34 release status

John W.: Release cut and sent to vdt in time for 1.10.1.  We are ready to start installing on the production server.

Chris: I was hoping to use a &#39;production&#39; version of the APR (Apache Portable Runtime) library but it is conflicting with the authentication libraries.

Philippe: Thanks to John, Chris, Jeff and Penelope for all the efforts in testing and fixing the release.

John W: I am hoping to start the installing tomorrow.

Igor: I am here to make sure that all work is being directed toward the FermiGrid supportable release of Gratia.

---++DB and Schema issues

Philippe: We need to enhance our documentation for adding new schema to the OSG Collector machine.

Steve: If we could use an extra 5K, we could replace one of the collector machines.

Diana: Who do I contact to get data back from TIBS

Steve: You need to put in an helpdesk ticket telling what to retrieve and where to retrieve it back.

---++WLCG/OSG Issues

Brian: John and I are making progress in getting the correct normalization factor for the ATLAS sites.

Steve: Fermi has the source for the SI2K test suites and we could run it ourself.

Philippe:  Well the problem is that the number obtain is not really meaningful for physics code.

John W: Currently the numbers are maintained manually, we are trying to move to an automated way via GIP
(well actually this move the manual steps towards the Site admin).

Brian: We are starting to upload VO summary data into the Gratia daily databases.  The goal is to be able to compare the data quality.  

Igor: This service is not in the requirement document, is it?

Brian: It might not be explicitly there, I shall consult OSG and check whether this is a required service and modify the OSG req doc
accordingly.

---++Report development

---++Collector

---++Probes

---++Test Bed


---++Any Other Business
Chris:

Collector tested, fixed and in VDT 1.10.1. Issues:

CommonName attribute can now be filled from new-style &quot;DN&quot; info as well as old-style KeyInfo. 

CommonName attribute can now be picked correctly from new-style KCA certificates (extra /CN=). 
Still need to get some highly desirable configuration attributes into the VDT MySQL configuration.

Local install of collector:

Fixed secure configuration, now works with basic connector. 
APR-aware connector currently does not work with glite-trustmanager -- asked for help. 

Probe improvements: 

Condor probe now gets information from wherever it can and avoids double-counting (GRAM log, history files). 

Condor probe generates per-job GRAM stubs from globus-condor.log, keeping state -- WS jobs are now accounted. 

Issues fixed in common certinfo handling. 

Still have problem whereby certinfo is missed for WS jobs with localJobId &lt; 100 -- testing fix. 

Need to improve exception handling so developers can see a meaningful stack trace when the need to -- testing.
