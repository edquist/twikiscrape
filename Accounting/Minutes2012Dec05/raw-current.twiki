1. Task #1 (Hyunwoo) - replication of production configuration
		Installed &quot;production&quot; version  of gratia-itb collector, reporter and database on separate VMs. Make sure that this is functional:
                Cloned VM gr12x4 and gr13x4  as as fermicloud318 and fermicloud319.
                Restored gratia-itb database on  fermicloud320
                Saved the images
                Modified configuration, granted appropriate permissions 
                tomcat log indicated problems with &quot;Definer&quot; set for trigger and views. Modified all encounters in /var/lib/mysql/gratia_itb/ *TRG and *.frm files - the problems seems to be fixed
                gratia-reporting  log displayed errors.  We realized that all procedures and functions are missing (/var/lib/mysql/mysql/proc....  files are empty.)
                Hyunwoo will try to understand what is the right procedure to restore this from mysql correctly so we do not loose procedures and functions.


2. Task #2 (John) - jsvc and tomcat configuration
		Downloaded jsvc src rpm from apache website, built it  on sl5, failed to run (JAVA_HOME error)
		Downloaded jsvc.tar file from production machine, built it -  some libs mismatch - can not run
		Copied jsvc executable from production machine. Was able to start tomcat and access it.
		sl6 comes with jsvc already - need to test it
               Started working on moving everything from tomcat-gratia to tomcat5.conf

3. Task #3 (Tanya) - urlrewrite (redirection to reporter running on different node)
		Was able to find the newest filters, libs for urlrewriteFilter
                Tested on the newest collector /reporter installation
                 Started working on spec file modification
                 Will need to split rpm to gratia-service and gratia-reporter.
