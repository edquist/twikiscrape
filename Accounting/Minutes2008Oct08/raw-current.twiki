---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Status of v1.0 release.

Penelope: I have consolidated the stored procedure using by the OSG reports. 
I have add the ability to select Sites in many reports.   I am working upgrading
the psacct reports to use to stored procedure (to enable see SQL query).

John: I am still running tests.

Chris: I have updated the documentation of the service properties files, still a bit more to do.

---++DB and Schema issues

---++OSG Issues

Brian: Xin&#39;s BNL request to get more precise WLCG uploads (per host SI2K)

Philippe: It is a responsibility of OSG-upload-to-WLCG project to update their query and eventually ask for upgrade in Gratia (if needed).

Brian: Need a way to monitor the Gratia Probe health via an RSV.

Chris: Depends on what part of the Probe you want to monitor.

Brian: If you could check if the ProbeConfig is valid and the Collector being pointed to is see-ing the data.

Brian: Need better advertising for Gratia in OSG.  In particular tell the site admin that there is useful information in Gratia.
I am sending links to the graphs and I am trying to get the admin to pay more attention to the data.

---++Operations

Dan: The KCA updates has forced a restart of the tomcat servers.

Chris: Tanya claims that we should not have been seeing this.

Chris: I think that the solution is to remove gridlite and to use apr instead.

Those kind of force restart should be rare (every several years).

Dan: I shall go back to the upgrade plan soon-ish.

---++CD Issues

---++Collector

---++Report development

---++Probes

So far no real discrepancy between condor and psacct found in specific checks (for a specific host).  Moving on to look at larger scale statistic.
