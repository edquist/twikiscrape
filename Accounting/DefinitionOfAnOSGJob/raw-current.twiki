This document attempts to provide the definition of what an OSG job is.
In order to reduce potential confusion this includes several proposals of definitions related to job.

---++Job Type Definitions

---+++User Submission (or Grid Job):
Set of Batch jobs and associated services executions induces
by a single user generated request (One click on a web form,
One call to grid_submit, condor_submit)

---+++Batch Job:
Single execution unit submitted to a batch system, usually
executed on a single host (unless &#39;MPI&#39; or related type of 
system is also used).

---+++Forwarding Job:
A batch job whose sole purpose is to forward the batch job
to a different gatekeeper/batch system.
The target gatekeeper/batch system might be in a different &#39;Grid&#39;.

---+++Forwarded Job:
A batch job that was forwarded for a different gatekeeper/batch system.
from a &#39;Forwarding Job&#39;.  The originating gatekeeper/batch system
might be in a different &#39;Grid&#39;.

---+++Pilot Job:
A batch job whose purpose is to execute one of more sub job
submitted directly to itself (as opposed to &#39;through the
gatekeeper of the current batch system).

---+++Sub-job (or Glexec job):
A batch job that was submitted via an auxilliary &#39;head node&#39;
who got control of the host via a pilot job.

---++OSG Job Definitions

*An OSG Job consists of zero, one or more OSG User Submissions plus zero, one or more OSG Batch Jobs.*

---+++OSG User Submission:
User Submission submitted via one of the OSG provided
&#39;portal&#39; tools or a VO-specific tool using OSG provided
&#39;portal&#39; tools or local submission in the case where the
owner of the Compute Element elected that the whole 
Compute Element is part of OSG.

---+++OSG Batch Job:
Batch job submitted to a Compute Element registered to OSG
via a &#39;grid/remote&#39; submission.
Batch job submitted to a Compute Element registered to OSG
via a local submission AND the owner of the Compute Element
elected that the whole Compute Element is part of OSG.

---++Additional Notes
Currently Gratia records all &#39;Batch Job&#39; but treat the 
Glexec jobs separately.  Aka when the glexec Gratia is
deploy the information is recorded but not display in
the default reports.

Currently Gratia &#39;double count&#39; the &quot;wall duration&quot; for
the Forwarding and the Forwarded job.  (I think this
affect only Fermigrid).  I think (but need to confirm)
that we can tell a Forwarding Job from a typical 
Batch Job by looking at the condor &#39;Universe&#39; for the
job. Is this a correct assumption?

---+++BOINC

How to account for BOINC jobs?  Especially those jobs that are not being submitted via an &#39;osg portal&#39;?

---+++Unknown VO in Gratia

A job is marked as belonging to the &quot;Unknown&quot; if:
   1. The grid vo map is not up to date and does not contain information pertaining to the user.
   2. The job is a local job.
