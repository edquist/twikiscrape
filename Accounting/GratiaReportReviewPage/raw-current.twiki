Comments:
   * For report &quot;Fraction of resource used by owner of resource&quot;: It would be useful if we had another column which listed the non-owner VOs running at each site.  It would also be useful to have the weekly and monthly averages available.
   * We need a &quot;CPU Efficiency&quot; report, or to add CPU efficiency to one of the reports.
   * Can we add a comparison in the &quot;Report from daily summary Gratia db&quot; between the VO-reported hours and the Gratia-reported hours?  Otherwise, this report is not useful.
Observations:
   * On May 21, UCSD had a 44% success rate for CMS jobs, which appears quite low.  What do we do with reports like this?  Send them to sites?  Note, but then ignore it?
   * Why does the VO &quot;germangrid&quot; run at UFlorida but nowhere else?  Who is this?
   * Most sites with low-efficiency are due to DZero, not really site problems.
   * Why does D0 only report to the summary collector for D0 sites, not all the OSG sites they use?
   * On May 22, ATLAS VO reported 12 jobs at AGLT2 for 18 hours of walltime.  Gratia shows 2000 hours of ATLAS walltime.  What gives?
   * On May 22, AGLT2 shows a large number of free CPUs.  Why no backfill?  &lt;img src=&quot;http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/gip_graphs/gip_free_cpus_history?excludefacility=USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE2|USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE3|USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE4|UCSDT2-B&amp;endtime=2008-05-23%2014:05:41&amp;span=1800&amp;starttime=2008-05-21%2014:05:41&amp;facility=AGLT2&amp;&quot;/&gt;
