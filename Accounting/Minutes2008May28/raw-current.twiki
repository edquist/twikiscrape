---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++v0.34 Release Status.

Chris:  Thanks to John I solved the problem under high load.  We are now ready to re-try on the ITB.

John W: We are re-sending yet another version to VDT, hopefully the last.

Philippe: We are about ready to install on the production server but we will need to use the &#39;big switch&#39; technique, due to the expected down-time.

Diana: I will attempt the restore from backup sometimes soonish.

---++OSG Issues

Brian: What is the down-time going to be?

Philippe: A few should be a couple of 5 minutes downtime.

Brian: Ok. 

Steve: Fermi-grid plan to close direct mysql access to the Gratia database in the medium term.

---++DB Issues.

FermiGrid:  20Gb (for 20 years) is not a problem, so one could indeed keep the daily summary for ever, we do not see a problem.

---++Any Other Business

Chris:  We needed to change the handling of the DN because of the new fermilab KCA.  The user real name used to be the last listed CN and now in the 2nd to last unless its is robot certificate, while the CERN certificate it is the last one.  So now instead of guessing which of the CN is the real name, we just record the whole list of CNs.

Philippe:  This is alright since we also need to deal with the name of the person changing from certificate to certificate (different CAs and/or different organization) so we will need a table CommonNameCorrection table similar to the VOCorrection table.

---++To be discussed later.
