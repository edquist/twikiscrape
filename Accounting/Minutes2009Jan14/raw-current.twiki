   * Stable condition.

Arvind: In the case of an expired host certificates and when going to a secure page, the output is blank.

---++OSG 

Brian: pushing the transfer probe to the &#39;expert&#39; sites.  Goal one additional site by the end of the week.

Brian: The information from Storage probe is somewhat also in GIP.    Last week we discussed who would be responsible for the re-writing of the Storage probe.   I noticed that OSG Storage has the work on their WBS (assigned probably to Andrei).

Brian: One issues is the installation instruction non targeted to the vdt download.  Several issues with the rpm being provided by dCache (they was a link between OS and ITB vs Production).   Also issue of rpm dependencies (missing dependency on gratia-common).

Brian: The Nebraska transfer probe is reporting to the local collector which is replicated to the main OSG collector. 
(should include both BestMan gridftp and dCache probe).

Brian: Should we install gridftp probe on CE to monitor the upload/download of the job log files?

Philippe: Not at the moment, we ought to first account for the SE transfers.

Brian: About the request from ATLAS/Horst to have report on the success/failure of the jobs.

Brian: OSG would look like to request Gratia team to make an estimate on how much this would be.

Philippe: Yes, we will provide this soonish.
