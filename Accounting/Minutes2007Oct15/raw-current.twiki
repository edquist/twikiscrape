RSV/Gratia Meeting
October 15

Arvind will send a new patch extending the Metric Record for new field and to adding the performance related field

RSV would like to keep track on whether the upload to WLCG have work or not.    This can be done either by 
adding a new column to the Metric_Meta column or more simply by writing a probe/connector similar to the 
Gratia probe which keep sending the record until they have been successfully uploaded.
