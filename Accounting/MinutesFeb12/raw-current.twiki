---++Collector/Report development

   * Penelope: I have some fixes to the reporting which need to be tested with Safari browser on OS/X. Please verify on the [[http://gratia-vm01.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/][test VM]]. Validator errors have been fixed, but the main problem was that Safari (and Konqueror) cannot handle iFrames with proprtional width / height specifications (eg 100%) so it is set to fixed pixel values for these browsers based on the browser string.
   * Philippe: I have added the capability to handle ResourceType to the collector. We need to put this on ITB to test it; probe versions 0.12i or better are required to send ResourceType information. Currently understood ResourceType values  are &quot;Batch&quot;, &quot;Storage&quot; and &quot;RawCPU&quot; (ps-accounting).
   * Philippe: Performance of the reporting needs to be improved -- we should look carefully into ways of improving this without overly increasing the resource load on the collector.
      * Jeff / Penelope: How does MONAlisa get present its information so quickly?
      * Philippe: MONAlisa caches previously-accessed information in the web service; MONAlisa is falling out of favor due to its resource requirements: we should not fall into that trap.
      * Penelope: We should be able to limit the cache size and still get an improvement.
      * Jeff: I am puzzled that we have EndTime index but we are apparently not taking advantage in terms of query times.
      * John: What about joins?
      * Philippe / Jeff: We do have them, but two of the three tables are very small (&lt;50 entries).
      * John: Make sure the large table is first in the query, and the joins are later.
   * Penelope: When selecting from the report menu on the left side, you get data with no identifier on which report you have just selected. I&#39;m trying to add some user-friendliness to the whole system.
   * Jeff: documented reports to understand which call reports, have drill-throughs, use summary tables, etc. Currently in an Access database.
   * Philippe: I would like to have a time estimate from Tanya on the roles work for the collector before she goes on vacation Friday.
      * Chris: I will take this up with Gabriele and Tanya.

---++Psacct reports.

   * Reminder: Chris still needs to update the reports on the psacct reporting server.

---++Probes

   * Philippe to John: obvious we need a test suite for probes. At a minimum, we need an install / record submission test for each probe.
   * John: higher priority right now is testing Condor 6.9 batch / probe interaction. A couple of discrepancies found in !ClassAd attributes between batch and managedfork jobs: I&#39;m following up with Alain.
   * Chris: Also, there is a unique !GlobalId which appears to be missing from all uploaded 6.9 records. &lt;strike&gt;Current indications are that this attribute was being obtained from the GRAM stub: investigations continue&lt;/strike&gt;. This problem turns out to have been internal to the condor_meter.pl: a code branch which constructed the global ID value was not being executed for condor 6.9; this has now been rectified.
   * Philippe/Chris: A new probe release (0.12i) was made late Friday to RPM and released to the VDT team for inclusion in VDT 1.61a. This includes the SGE probe from the NERSC team.

Jon: I&#39;ve been looking into the GLUE schema: what is available, etc. Not all things are reported by all sites, and not all accurately. Rob G. suggested listing desired attributes first, and then ascertaining from where to obtain the data. I have some GLUE data from John W. to examine.
