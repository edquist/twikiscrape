---++ The Gratia install-release script.

%VIEWTHISTOPIC%

This script is a wrapper around gratia-upgrade.sh, as an attempt to reduce the options and arguments required in the most common cases.

Usage information follows below:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
install-release [&lt;opt&gt;] &lt;release&gt;
install-release [&lt;opt&gt;] -B &lt;official-build&gt;
install-release [&lt;opt&gt;] -L &lt;full-release-path&gt;
install-release [-h]

Build Types:
   Default
      Official release (found as ~gratia/gratia-releases/gratia-&lt;release&gt;.
   -B
      Official build (found as ~gratia/gratia-builds/gratia-&lt;official-build&gt;.
   -L
      Local build (found as &lt;full-release-path&gt;).

Help:
   -h
      This help.

Options:
   -a
      Auto-start collector (default no start).

   -c &lt;config&gt;
      Instance name is tomcat-&lt;config&gt; (except see -p).

   -p
      Production: instance name is tomcat-gratia, config-name=&lt;config&gt;

   -v
      Verbose: mention a little more about what we&#39;re doing.

Default config name is current user name (XXX), unless -p is
specified (in which case there is no default and -c is required).

Examples

   Install and start a development collector tomcat-greenc as root on
   the machine in question:

      install-release -a -c greenc -L ~greenc/gratia-test

   Install and start a development collector tomcat-greenc remotely
   (assuming user is greenc):

      install-release -a -L ~greenc/gratia-test

   Install an integration collector with the latest build (manual
   start):

      install-release -c itb_gratia_itb -B latest

NOTES

   Any specified instance (either explicitly with -c or implicitly as
   &lt;user&gt;) must correspond to a configuration cluse in a collector-*.dat
   file. See gratia/common/configuration/collector*.dat for examples.

&lt;/verbatim&gt;
