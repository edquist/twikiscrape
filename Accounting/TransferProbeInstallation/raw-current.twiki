---++ Gratia dcache-transfer Probe

Extract from http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras/InstallingDcacheForOSG.README.html

_(Experimental instructions can be found at: http://t2.unl.edu/documentation/gratia/dcache-transfer-probe-installation )_

The dCache transfer Probe is installed as part of the dCache distribution and can be enable via the dCache configure script.

During the configure of dCache, after the configuration of the pool location and size, you will be asked about the gratia probes:

_Next, gratia probes are configured (gratia probes collect various statistics about file transfer, space allocation by VOs  and pool utilization). The data collected by the probes will be sent to a central collector. You will be ask to provide the following information:_
   * URL of central collector [ Use gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8886 for a production server (OSG) and gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8881 for an integration test server (ITB); or the address of your local Gratia collector if any ]
   * The username, password and port number of dCache admin interface
   * Name of your SE
   * Name of the Grid to which the SE belongs (OSG-ITB, OSG, LOCAL)  
   * Gratia can notify you if Gratia server went down so you will be asked questions related to email settings

If you are relying on /etc/init.d, also make sure to say &#39;y&#39; in the next section of the configuration for the script /etc/init.d/gratia-dcache-transfer start


---++ Gratia gridftp-transfer Probe

Extract from https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGratiaTransferProbe:

If you are using !GridFTP server that is installed during the !BeStMan installation you will need just to enable Gratia grdiftp-transfer probe:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
cd $VDT_LOCATION
vdt-control -enable  gratia-gridftp-transfer
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are running !GridFTP server on a different node, on each node you will need to install Gratia grdiftp-transfer probe. In order to do so you will need to
change directory to !GridFTP installation directory
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
cd  &amp;lt;VDT_LOCATION&amp;gt;
. setup.sh
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_XXX_cache:Gratia-GridFTP-Transfer-Probe 
&lt;/pre&gt; 

After Gratia grdiftp-transfer probe is installed or enabled you will need to configure it:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia  \
 --probe gridftp-transfer \
 --report-to &amp;lt;gratia_host:gratia_port&amp;gt; \
 --probe-cron --site-name &amp;lt;SiteName&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where _gratia_host_ is FQDN of Gratia collector, _gratia_port_ is Gratia Collector port and  _SiteName_ is your site name.

If you want to do additional changes in configuration, eg change location of gridftp logs or name of the Grid (default is OSG) you can edit _ProbConfig_file  located in
_$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer_ directory
