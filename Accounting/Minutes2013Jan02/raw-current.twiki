Notes from Meeting 1/2/2013
Present H. Kim, T. Levshina, S. Timm,
 
Previous status--Hyunwoo managed to get stuff working with upgrade
 
Tanya--different rpm for reporting vs. services
John W.--jsvc
 
 
Current--service configuration and service authorization
For url redirection--
URL redirection true or false--if true, then where to redirect
 
/etc/gratia/service
 
heartbeat resource would modify this file.
 
redirection has been updated to latest jar file for url reporting
 
2 rpms gratia-service and gratia-reporting
 
JSVC--
OSG software distributes something called jsvc, but that doesn&#39;t work
 
 
 
In old version, all java options are in jsvc startup script.
configure_tomcat script to set it all up.
 
script should make tomcat.jsvc, link tomcat5 to that in /etc/init.d
 
tomcat configure goes to gratia
 
Ready with first rpm to test.
 
Hyunwoo to try the install again with jsvc and split rpms.
Once that version installed on fermicloud318/319, FGS will edit the heartbeat scripts to reflect the new location of configuration files that we edit on the fly.
 
gratiaweb--will install a local Fermi copy as part of this.
