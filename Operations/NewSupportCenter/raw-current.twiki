---+ New Support Center

Here is documentation on how to get started as a new Support Center.

---++ OSG Operations Model

First, familiarize yourself with the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=47&quot;&gt;OSG Operations Model&lt;/a&gt;.
In short, You will be responsible for sending issues to and receiving issues from other Support Centers via Footprints, the OSG Operations Trouble Ticket System.

---++ Register as a Support Center

If you haven&#39;t already registered your support center, please go to the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=69&quot;&gt;registration page&lt;/a&gt; and
do so.  Remember that as a Support Center you have an obligation to respond to and resolve issues that get routed to you; in return, you get to send issues to other Support Centers and ask them to resolve
issues on your behalf.  You are also responsible for routing issues when possible -- you are an ad hoc
member of OSG Operations! If this is too large a commitment for your site, you may want to
consider Trash/CommunitySupport.WebHome.

---++ Footprints (OSG Trouble Ticket System)
---+++ Request a Footprints account 

Rob Quick (rquick@IUPUI.EDU) is responsible for distributing accounts.  Send him an e-mail with the proposed account name, your name, and your VO.  %RED% (This could be deprecated by more information at the time of SC registration -- could we also use certs to login?) %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Review the Footprints tutorial/FAQ/etc

%RED% This needs to be written? %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Attend Operations Meetings

You will probably find it useful to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/WebHome#Meetings&quot;&gt;Operations meetings&lt;/a&gt;.  The minutes are regularly posted to the [[Operations.WebHome][Operations twiki]] if you are unable to attend.  You&#39;ll also want to join the
&lt;a href-&quot;http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=97&amp;Itemid=102&quot;&gt;Operations mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.

---++ Congratulations

Congratulations, you&#39;re now a Support Center!  Welcome to OSG operations!
