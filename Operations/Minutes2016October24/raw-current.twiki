---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

---++ Security
   * New vulnerability has been reported regarding Linux kernel privilege escalation. We received report from EGI: https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2016-5195 It consists on a race condition found in the way the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. It is referred as DirtyCOW. By exploiting this vulnerability, an unprivileged local user could gain access to read-only memory mappings and increase her privileges on the system. RedHat has not published security updates for affected OS versions yet. The CVE report appears as ongoing work.
      * As the time of writing, RedHat has published security update only for RHEL 7: [[http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2098.html][http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2098.html]]
   * Started OSG Risk Assessment for 2016. Service owners have been contacted through email asking for filling surveys to evaluate security controls intended to guarantee Data Integrity in OSG.
