---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO Spotlight on NYSGRID

A collaboration of institutes across the state, such as, Buffalo, Cornell, ARPI and Stoneybrook. One of the purposes is to make it easy for smaller institutions to use the OSG resources and allow them to participate even if they aren&#39;t providing resources. So there is a lot of collaboration with the smaller institutions. Enagement VO utilization is being used to get some training materials up. They have twelve contributors so far. There is an upcoming workshop mostly for technical users in NYSGRID.  A goal is get everyone on 0.6.0 as well as cover the topic of how to port over apps to run on the grid and support those apps and users.

2) DZero Production Run Update

From Brad Abbott&#39;s email, D0 is essentially finished with its reprocessing of data.  We have a handful of merging to do but this is small.  Due to issues with making sure we do not duplicate jobs it may be a week or two before we are completely done, but we have less than 1% of the data to merge. *See attachment at the end of the agenda for more information.*

Some of the ATLAS sites may be upgrading to 0.6.0 this week. Horst stated that they&#39;re still awaiting new hardware and anticipate July as a possible time to upgrade.

4) OSG Site Admin Meeting July 30/31

Alain sent out an agenda to all of those individuals who have submitted a Resource registration. It is preferable that at least one administrator from each site be available to attend the meeting. The meeting is at Fermilab.

5) Condor security vulnerability

See links below for ticket 3573. Email was sent out to the security contacts and Support Centers on Friday. There is a planned technical discussion about this next week at the Operations Meeting.

6) VDT CA certificates updated with IGTF 1.14

Released today and announcements were sent to osg-general and the Support Centers.

---++ OSG RA Items

A new version of the DOEGrids software will go production in a few weeks. Scripts that interact with the site for renewals and grid admin will need to be updated because the URLs will be changing in the new version. A date has not been identified for the update, so we&#39;ll keep this as a recurring item on the agenda.

---++ Pending Registrations

None.
