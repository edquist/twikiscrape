---++ Hot Topics for the week

   * CERN VOMS Maintenance 
       Steve reports a short outage earlier this weekend. Extended attributes is 24 hours, CMS standard is 190, this may not be affecting jobs in the OSG as we don&#39;t check extended attributes, this will affect  CMS LCG jobs. Nothing the OSG GOC can do at the moment, GGUS ticket is opened. Mirrored version is not using the new 24 hour time out.
   * Resources Missing the MIS GridScan Cert Update (Kyle, Elizabeth and Rob will call each admin)
      * GLOW-ATLAS 
      * UC_Teraport
      * HEPGRID_UERJ
      * UNI-OSGEDU
      * UNM_HPC

---++ OSG RA Items
   * Jim mentions DOEGrids PMA meeting, how to address the audit of the CA. ID vetting process is fine as is... there will not need to be any changes. CP/CPS will be udpate. Renewal process will require a second vetting after 5 years. Improvement to logging and documentation process. 
   * John Hover, host cert with wildcard DN. This is not allowed by current DOE process. RR services could use this... DOEGrids is looking at possibilities. 
   * Tim Silvers needs to be unsubscribed from OSG-RA list.
