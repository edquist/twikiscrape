---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesMay14][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO Spotlight on Engage

One research group is currently active with over 150 CPU hours needed in a few weeks to process jobs. About four other projects are in the pipeline and it&#39;s difficult to say when those projects will take off, but hopefully sometime in the next six weeks, the majority being serial jobs. One is going to be a resource provider and consumer. Current application is a protein analysis app used to submit a large number of jobs and come up w/prefidications of proteins, go back into the lab to analyze the data, then run more jobs, typically a week or so at a time. Increased support is needed (around 300 jobs at once) goal is around 500. 12 sites currently successfully support Engage, which are also running 0.6.0 and not 0.4.0. No additional support is needed from the operations group at this time.

2) DZero Production Run Update

95% complete. They&#39;re doing a lot of clean-up with the errors they&#39;ve received during the run.

3) OSG Mailing Lists

What lists should we subscribe someone to when they register a new resource, VO, or SC? Marcia has added an attachment to the agenda (at the bottom) which lists the current known lists. Please review the list provided and add any lists of which you know are not included. The goal is to auto-subscribe users to the appropriate lists rather than ask them to join them, which is what the GOC has done with the welcome emails sent out when users have submitted new registrations. Marcia will work on setting up the GOC as a moderator for the appropriate lists so that the GOC can automate the subscriptions.

5) OSG Site Admin Meeting July 30/31

Alain sent out an agenda to all of those individuals who have submitted a Resource registration. It is preferable that at least one administrator from each site be available to attend the meeting. The meeting is at Fermilab.

CEMon/BDII server update. Another hardware failure last Thursday evening has caused us to move the is.grid.iu.edu service to a new server and that has gone well. The failure caused the file system to go read-only, but services were still running. We&#39;re taking steps to ensure this failure does not recur. Redundancy and fail-over is going to be implemented at the GOC very soon.

Arvind has written some site probes. Test from GRAM authentication, batch schedulers, GridFTP, etc. and the probes are perl scripts that conform to WLCG standards. They will be linked to the agenda very shortly. Each site admin would configure Condor cron to run these probes on their systems and have an infrastructure to grab that output in a central database. The purpose of the probes is to allow individual service testing, so if you aren&#39;t running a particular service and don&#39;t want to test against it like site_verify does, you can run any number of these probes you wish.
