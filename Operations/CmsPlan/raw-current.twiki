---++ Overview

A content management system (CMS) [1] is a system providing a collection of 
procedures used to manage work flow in a collaborative environment. These 
procedures are designed to:

   * Allow for a large number of people to share and contribute to stored data;
   * Control access to data based on user role;
   * Facilitate storage and retrieval of data;
   * Control data validity and compliance;
   * Reduce duplicate inputs;
   * Improve communication among users.

---++ Scale of the current problem

OSG wishes to consolidate its various web available information under a single management umbrella. The information sources being considered are

   * TWiki, several thousand pages
   * www.opensciencegrid.org, of order 100 pages
   * !DocDb, about 2000 files

At all points of the decision making process it should be remembered that the process may lead to the &quot;do nothing&quot; option. OSG may be forced into
this solution by availability of effort, cost/benefit or other considerations.

---++ Possible solutions

Reference [2] lists 1217 content management systems, as  of this writing. Clearly, a detailed evaluation of each of these is impossible. Therefore, a procedure to identify candidate systems must be developed ( _Selection of candidates_ below) . When a set of candidates is identified a set of criteria for determining their suitability for this use must be established ( _Constraints_ ). After The initial candidate list has been narrowed to suitable candidates a small number must be chosen, most likely by subjective methods, for final evaluation.
 

---++ Selection of candidates

Clearly, 1200+ candidate systems is unmanageable. A significantly smaller number (perhaps 10) must be identified for further consideration.
References [8,9] give general advice on how to choose a CMS.

---+++ User survey

User satisfaction is always a guiding principle in a service oriented effort. Requesting input from the OSG community would be a powerful technique to identify candidate CMSs.
Informal discussions have identified _Confluence_ and _Wordpress_ as candidates.

---+++ Other similar organizations

Large Universities, National Labs, XSEDE and EGI have requirements similar to OSG. Their choices should be considered candidate systems unless they can
be eliminated by identified constraints. The simple fact that XSEDE chose  _LifeRay_ indicates that system should be considered.

---+++ Technical means

Many CMS comparison sites exist, some with systems rated by preference. [3-6]. Using ratings generated by other authors exposes this process to the bias of those authors. However, surveys with a large population of respondents exist and this mitigates the exposure to bias. For example, [3] rates Drupal in the top ten overall with over 19,000 respondents providing a rating. Selection of &quot;top rated&quot; sites with the additional requirement that more than some number of responses (2,000 was used in this example) could also be a selector.

---++++ Examples

Examining a survey at [3] and sorting by number of votes received yields, for example: 
   * Drupal
   * concrete5
   * Joomla
   * PHP-Fusion
   * Redaxscript
   * CMS Made Simple
   * !NukeViet
   * MODx
   * Mambo
   * synType CMS
   * !MyBB
 
 Again, using [3] and sorting by User rating with the additional requirement a system received more than 2000 votes gives:
   * Joomla
   * Textpattern
   * Redaxscript
   * !MyBB
   * CMS Made Simple
   * MODx
   * Website Baker
   * Drupal
   * Mambo
   * !NukeViet

Reference [4] gives a &quot;Top 12&quot; list:
   * Wordpress
   * Joomla 
   * Drupal
   * Silverstripe
   * Cushy CMS
   * Frog CMS
   * MODx
   * TYPOlight
   * dotCMS
   * Expression Engine
   * Radiant CMS
   * concrete5

---++ Constraints

CMSs have widely variable sets of features. Some features are required for a system to suitable to this purpose, others are desirable but not required and some irrelevant. Any candidate CMS must have the essential features or it should not be considered further. The first step of this plan is to identify these features or constraints so as to prune the decision tree to a manageable size. Below are listed some constraints arranged by category. This list is not intended to be necessary or sufficient but serves as a starting point for discussion. The language for the features is taken from reference [2].
 
   A. Absolute, constraints which if unsatisfied, _define_ the CMS as unsuitable.
      i. Document Approval
      i. Document management (if !DocDb to be included)
      i. Extensible user profiles
      i. Granular Privileges
      i. SSL compatible
      i. Version control
      i. Wiki
      i. Others?
   A. Preferred, features that add additional desirability to the system but are not _required_
      i. Conversion tools (!TikiWiki, for example, can convert TWiki pages)
      i. Open source/Minimal cost
      i. Site Map
      i. SSL logins and pages 
      i. Others?
   A. Desired, features which add _additional capability_ to the OSG web presence or _enhance usability_.
      i. WYSIWYG editor
      i. Others?
   A. Security
      i. Any known vulnerabilities should be addressed quickly. Currently known vulnerabilities are listed in [7].

---++ Final evaluation and decision

After the initially selected candidates have been shown to satisfy the constraints a final selection must be made. 

Any system surviving the selection process to this point would be  technically capable of providing the required functionality. Subjective criteria will probably be used 
at this point to make the final decision and these criteria are most easily evaluated by testing of a prototype.

The web site associated with a CMS typically provides
a demo instance that could be used. Reference [3] provides links to over 250 demo sites. In some cases, the GOC already has test instances available in particular
for _Confluence_ and _WordPress_. Input from users of the system should be solicited at this point, particularly the Support Team, the Documentation Team and the Software Team.

This input should include an estimate of the effort required to convert the existing content (or the portion of existing content to be converted). Evaluation of effort available for the conversion can reasonably be made at this point.
