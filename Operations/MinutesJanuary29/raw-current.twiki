---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJanuary22][previous meeting]]

1) Secure TWiki status
   *  Has a date for implementation been determined? - Yes, this has been set to happen at 5pm EST on Friday, Feb 2, 2007.  This might take a while for the DNS to propogate.


---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on OSG

   * VO for participants that don&#39;t have another VO to join.  There are more single researchers that are members. This is also a place for people to be until they set up their own VOMS service.  There isn&#39;t too much participation right now, though there was before SC2006.  This is all hosted at IU


2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * *Last update*:   Three groups of jobs that refuse to &quot;go&quot;. Jobs at Purdue, UNM, and Chicago. A small number of jobs are left and the experiment is almost completed. !NanoHUB is talking with Tim at UNM and Jaime at Wisconsin concerning these issues.
   * 3 problems.  Group of jobs at purdue that have lost a saved file.  Has sent mail to Tim at New Mexico but hasn&#39;t heard back.  Purdue hasn&#39;t come up with any solutions as well.  Will send the details to the goc so that they can send details out to larger audience.

   * *This week*: 

---++ OSG RA Items

   * Doug did not attend, nothing obvious that needed to be covered.

---++ Pending Registrations

   * Iowa State - Production CE - Running ATLAS jobs now.  ~40 CPUs.  Start with 18, then bring it up to 40 eventually.  Hope to have a total of ~80 machines when finished.  DOSAR is the current support center.

   * Florida State CMS - 40 dual core nodes coming online.  Seems to be functioning online.  Small problems installing OSG, but seems to be working now.  USCMS is the support center.

   * Virginia CMS - Beginning an upgrade and migration to OSG.  Brought up one node, plan to bring 12 cores in the next two weeks.  In the end, around 60 cores and over a terabyte of storage.  CMS is the support center

---+++ Resources

1) isuhep
   * Production CE supported by DOSAR. ResURL and authentication fail.

2) FSU-HEP
   * Production CE supported by USCMS. ResURL and authentication fail.

3) UVA-HEP
   * Production CE supported by USCMS. Site_verify passes.

---+++ NWICG

   * 2685 Fermi/Remedy - 87775 - edg-mkgridmap.conf entry for NWICG
      * The latest OSG 0.5.1 edg-mkgridmap.conf file entry for NWICG for results in an internal server error when edg-mkgridmap is executed.
      * Seems to be some conflicts between different versions of the VOMS software.  The issue will be talked over with Kevin, etc.  There were problems contacting the support center.  

---++ Other issues

   * End of life for UIowa-prod.  When will this be removed from OSG?  Will pull it off of monitoring ASAP.
