---+++ Removed from OSG
   * BNL-LCG2 Deprecated Resource [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7658][7658]] 

---++ OSG RA Items &amp; CA Questions 
   * Guidelines for extensions on X509 certificate are defined in our standards document, the CP-CPS, some changes were made so that to allow for an extended key usage field which was mistakenly marked as critical. This caused authentication failures in some places. It has been fixed and DOEGrids hopes to avoid this in the future with a new testing regimen.
      * Steve Timm and Rob expressed a desire for notifications of such changes in the future.
