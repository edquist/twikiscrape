---+++ Proposed change to the morning RSV reports

   * Existing [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/2012/08/12/ATLAS_Site_Report-2012-08-12.html][&quot;site&quot; report]] _(to be discontinued 31/OCT)_
   * Existing [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/2012/08/12/Atlas_RSV_MyWLCG_Comparison-2012-08-12.html][comparison report]] _(to be discontinued 31/OCT)_
      * the &quot;site&quot; report is really a resource report.
      * a similar pair is sent to CMS (11 users)
   * The ATLAS and CMS comparisons are concatenated and re-sorted to generate a report sent to a few individuals and rsv-sam _(to be discontinued 31/OCT)_

   * An approximation to the [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/test.html][proposed replacement]] (for ATLAS T2 sites) _(ATLAS, CMS and !MoU versions to go active 31/Oct)_

   * The [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/2012/08/12/OSG_Sites_RSV_Report-2012-08-12.html][OSG site report]] sent to osg-accounting (29 users) , osg-sites (138 users) _(to be discontinued 31/OCT)_
