---++ Security
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * HIGH&#39; risk vulnerability concerning SLURM workload manager prolog script, which may allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file on the system. Sites running SLURM are recommended to update relevant components as soon as possible (CVE-2016-10030)
      * Linux kernel vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7117.
         * Ticket https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31838 was closed because we could not find any grid software using recvmsg function. However, there are updates for RedHat and Scientific Linux. Security team will discuss if an announcement with the security updates links are needed.
