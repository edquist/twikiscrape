---++ Executive Summary
This SLA is an agreement between OSG Operations and the OSG Management and Stakeholders describing details of the OASIS software distribution system.

---++ Owners
This SLA is owned by OSG Operations and Indiana University and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team and OSG Stakeholders.

---++ Service Name and Description
---+++ !!Name
OASIS (OSG Application and Software Installation Service) system
---+++ !!Description

The OASIS service provides OSG Virtual Organizations with a central location for application software. The content hosted on OASIS can be made available on OSG compute resources. The service consists of three virtual machines, a stratum 0 CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS) server, a stratum 1 replica of the stratum 0 and a node accessible for login by VO OASIS managers.
 
This SLA covers the stratum 1 replica. The stratum 0 and login SLA is available [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/OASISServiceLevelAgreement][here]]. 

---++ Security Considerations

The OASIS replica is accessible for login only by GOC and OSG technology group staff. It is publicly available as read-only.

---++ Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times

This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see [[#Requests_for_Service_Enhancement][Requests for Service Enhancement]] for information on planned maintenance outages.
