   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2013/04/goc-services-update-tuesday-april-9th.html][Release note]]

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * Processed 7 tickets for Site renaming in Gratia, to make the sites listed in Gratia report for APEL-WLCG correspond to OIM.
   * Continue to process GOC 14222 about unknown VO&#39;s in gratia. Have stopped the majority of unknown VO&#39;s being reported but still have to clean up the mess.  Lots of manual work involved.
   * Frequency of ReSS automatic restarts is increasing, have to restart ReSS twice a day just to keep up.  Problem is malformed classads from the new
     osg-info-services software under osg 3.x.  GOC ticket 14443 to red.unl.edu and SOFTWARE-997 in JIRA have thus far gone unanswered. 
   * Will be scheduling meeting on future of ReSS with Rob and Scott and possibly the remaining ReSS stakeholders, once Rob gets back, but need the above issue fixed to be able to survive in the meantime.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Made Condor 7.8.8 default for glideins to use.
   * Upgraded UCSD Factory to glideinWMS 2.7 on Wednesay 4/10
      * OSG XSEDE Frontend had problems after upgrade. It turns out there was a bug in their validation script all along, but only 2.7 caught it. Mats Rynge and Tanya Levshina fixed it.
   * Engage frontend was no longer working after switch to OSG digicert service certificate.  We helped Steven Cox debug the issue, it is resolved.
