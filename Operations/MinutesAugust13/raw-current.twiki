---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesAugust6][previous meeting]]

1. Retirement of the OSG VOMS at IU. https://iggy.uits.indiana.edu/~tsilver/data_file lists to which VOMS sites are connecting. The OSG VOMS at IU will be retired at the end of August. GOC will be notifying sites that are still using the IU VOMS soon. A recent VO package will get these sites updated to refer to the OSG VOMS at Fermilab instead of IU.

2. VORS VO Reporting Issues

1.  VO spotlight will pick up again next week.

2. Gratia reporting issues. We asked some of the sites if they&#39;ve had any progress in resolving these issues.
