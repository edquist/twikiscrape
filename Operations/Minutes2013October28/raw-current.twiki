   * Kevin is at HEPIX this week.
   * Have not found more details yet about currentl java vulnerabilities in the most recent update, but appears to affect both client and server installs, so recommend installing updates when available. Now would be a good time to look at updating Java 6 installs to Java 7.
   * Still tracking external security incident. So far no OSG certificates have been compromised.
