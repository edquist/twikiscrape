---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesApril16][previous meeting]]

A couple more sites (OSG_LIGO_PSU &amp; Vanderbilt) have announced they will support the Engage VO. If you can support them, please do so and notify the GOC so that the information can be recorded in our ticket.

Maintenance Tool - Wayne asked for a text-based tool from which to grab data with site tools. GOC will look into this. VORS provides a text-based interface, but maintenance is set manually. The Maintenance Tool currently provides an XML format as well.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO spotlight - !CompBioGrid

They have 13 sites that they can access with jobmanager Fork. 300 batch slots for peak is their goal. They will send the GOC a list of sites where they can run successfully currently. It will be two to three months time before they get up to a production level and start dealing with issues.

2) DZero Production Run Update

7.7 million events processed in one day over the weekend, their best yet! 300 of the 500 million events have been run. They consider this run to be going very well.

3) OSG sites upgraded to 0.6.0

   * AGLT2 *new*
   * ASGC_OSG
   * CIT_CMS_T2
   * FNAL_FERMIGRID
   * FNAL_GPFARM
   * GRASE-NYU-BENCH *new*
   * GROW-PROD
   * HEPGRID_UERJ
   * Lehigh_coral
   * OSG_INSTALL_TEST_2 *new*
   * OSG_LIGO_PSU
   * STAR-BNL
   * STAR-WSU
   * TTU-ANTAEUS
   * UARK_ACE *new*
   * UCR-HEP
   * UFlorida-IHEPA *new*
   * UFlorida-PG *new*
   * USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE
   * UWMilwaukee
   * Vanderbilt

A couple of sites appear to be missing from this list, but they have upgraded to 0.6.0. GOC will update this list. It appears they site_verify may be timing out on those sites, as VORS does not report their version as 0.6.0.

As for future plans to upgrade sites, Horst says they have a new ITB site that they&#39;ll install 0.6.0 on and register this week.

---++ OSG RA Items

No items.

---++ Pending Registrations

---+++ Virtual Organization (VO)

ILC (International Linear Collider)
   * Located at Fermilab. VO URL: http://ilc.fnal.gov/
   * It has been in existence for a while, but it hadn&#39;t been registered.
   * The Fermilab Support Center will be the support center.
   * Purpose: Simulation for accelerator and detector ILC and RND.
   * A new VO package with this new VO is pending.
   * EB Questions:
      * Is it operating it&#39;s own VOMS, i.e. seperate from other VOMS servers already running at fnal? *No. !FermiGrid is running the VOMS server but it is a separate VOMS instance.*
      * Is this a VO that owns its own root path or is it simply a group within the fnal VO? Can&#39;t tell from the VOMS url. *Yes, it is a root path.*

---+++ Resource(s)

NERSC-Davinci
   * Production CE for NERSC. Registration info is complete.
   * Site passes authentication but it does not pass Hello World. The local MIS directory can&#39;t be written to. Perhaps it doesn&#39;t exist?

---+++ VDT

3230 Fermi/Remedy - 94146 - Sync gums-client.properties with prima-authz.conf ?
   * Opened by Burt. No action yet on the VDT ticket.

---+++ Others

3367 was brought up by Burt which was destined for USATLAS. Fred said he would followup with the user. The ticket probably should have been routed to the GGUS system since the user is an international ATLAS user. It was not apparent to the GOC that this was an international user. Fred and Burt will work on some guidelines the GOC can leverage to make such distinctions.

3327 - CDF VOMS server still failing VOMS Monitor and the ticket is still open. John Rosheck will look at it, but if they&#39;re running a version newer than that in the VDT package, we may not be able to support it. John will get back to Steve on this ticket.

3273 Vandertilt not on the Gratia Accounting page again. It was on there and the ticket was closed, but then the issue reappeared and the ticket was not reopened since incoming email will not open close Footprints tickets at the GOC. This issue will be reopened and sent to the Gratia group.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

Agenda: http://indico.cern.ch/categoryDisplay.py?categId=258

No OSG issues.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans

Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA&#39;s deprecation is not appreciated. Gratia and the other monitoring tools don&#39;t provide a lot of useful data on a day to day basis as to what&#39;s going on. Wayne from STAR brought this issue up and he will compile the data they are looking to obtain.

---+++ WLCG interoperability

---+++ Support Center Attendance
