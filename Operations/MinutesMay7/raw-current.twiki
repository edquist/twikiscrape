---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO Spotlight on GUGrid

Not much activity yet, but plan to pick things up. Trying to get the hardware situation firmed up. Terascale a system they have now and add a couple terabyte storage node. Lining up possible users to participate in OSG at the moment. Not much of a physics lab, but a researcher has biomedical experiment simulation code that he may try out on OSG, and others may wish to participate as well. Components: 4 compute nodes. A blade system with a terabyte of storage.

2) DZero Production Run Update

3-4 million events a day. Lhe large Lani site is still down, but it should be up this week. DZero will try to get the resource selector running now that we have numerous 0.6.0 sites. Also, Parag is working with the ATLAS staff at IU on getting jobs running there.

4. Running job campaign

New users often struggle with running jobs on the osg. We want to set a good first-impression and recognizing this is a problem Ruth and Miron decided to make a campaign to fix this. There are troubleshooting guides posted and a web form for users to submit trouble tickets to the goc. There is a pointer on the OSG home page to the campaign information. Any information that is missing can be added, so please browse through this information and submit your feedback. Better wording for the button was recommended.
