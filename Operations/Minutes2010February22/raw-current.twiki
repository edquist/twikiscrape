---++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2010February15][Previous Meeting Agenda]]
   * Last week&#39;s availability metrics
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ycogjev][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]] 
      * Rob asked why the availability for the &quot;OSG high level display&quot; was only 92%.We have seen a few problems we did tweaked a few things but it is a lot more stable. We will have to investigate to find out more on why. There was a down time last week, which could be affecting the percentage. Power outage related to last week could also be part of the reason.
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yaan8zf][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/new-release-113-of-ca-certificates.html][OSG CA Distribution 1.13]] released on Feb 18th 2010
      * There was a problem with the IGTF new ca from Europe with a bad sign policy file, which caused errors. That stemmed the 1.34 release. How much trouble did it cause end users? It did not seem to cause too many problems with users.
      * Also [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/osg-ca-distribution-release-112-goc.html][OSG CA Distribution 1.12]] released on Feb 16th 2010
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/osg-ticket-exchange-11-bug-patched.html][GOC-TX 1.1 - Bug Fix release]] - Fixed bug that was causing initial assignment update by GOC staff on a ticket assigned to GGUS to not show up. ([[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8114#1265985224][An example of the problem]] - this update did not make it to [[https://gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55511][GGUS ticket]])
   * Only effected the opening of a GOC ticket to GGUS, which only effected the GOC/Rob at the time but could have been worse.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/upcoming-gratia-maintenance.html][Gratia Maintenance - Part 1]]
      * Not related to RSV collector hosted by the GOC, which remains unaffected!
      *  IT took longer than thought because of power outage. Other than that they didn&#39;t have any issues.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/fnal-power-outage.html][FNAL Power outage]] - and follow up notifications: [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/fnal-power-outage-update.html][Update 1]], [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/osg-docdb-access-problem.html][Update 2]]
