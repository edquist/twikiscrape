---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

   * CERN CVMFS
      * During the weekend the CVMFS stratum 1 service at CERN suffered from a full partition.
      * cvmfs repositories only mirrored at CERN became totally unavailable , i.e the non-production /cvmfs/lhcb-conddb.cern.ch
      * For other repositories e.g /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch , /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch all clients including those at CERN will have now all switched away from CERN to use alternate other stratum ones.
   * Current situation at 13:00 on Monday:
      * All cvmfs repositories except for /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch are again served correctly from cvmfs-stratum-one.cern.ch.
      * /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch is currently not available from CERN.
   * With the exception of /cvmfs/lhcb-conddb.cern.ch everything is transparent to all users including both readers and writers of CVMFS.
