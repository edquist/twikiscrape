-- Main.ScottTeige - 21 Sep 2010

---++ Announcements
   * Indianapolis machine room move Oct. 12
   * Rob Quick on vacation to 26/Sep (Currently available for emergencies)
      * Contact Kyle (kagross at indiana dot edu) for Support Issues and Scott (steige at indiana dot edu) for Infrastructure.
   * Scott to take vacation upon Rob&#39;s return.

---++ Network outage
   * On 16/Sep between 9:10 and 9:45 EDT network traffic between the machine room in Indianapolis and Bloomington was blocked due to a mis-configured firewall. GOC services were apparently uneffected for outside users.

---++ BDII stress test
   * At the suggestion of Burt H., Brian B., Igor S. in coordination with the GOC are proposing to stress test the BDII-itb. A script has been written that approximates a real use case request. It is proposed that this script will be run against the BDII-itb from many geographically distributed sites.
      * BDII-itb currently running a recent version
      * BDII-itb was restarted with flags that allow detailed logging
      * munin tests installed to monitor/plot machine status
      * Small scale test is next (1 iteration, ~5 sites)
      * Then scale up until capacity to test is reached or machine cannot keep up. (Current rate is 1800 requests per minute, unfortunately, not evenly distributed between the two production instances)

_It was generally agreed that this is an acceptable plan. Initial testing at low rate will begin upon availability of Brian B. and Igor S.. Steve T. will be consulted for ideas/requirements. Testing at scale will begin after announcement to ITB team_
 
---++ GOC internal audit program
   * 3 ITB VMs have been rebuilt. All will have been rebuild by 26/Oct
      * data-itb.grid.iu.edu

---++ Security exploit
