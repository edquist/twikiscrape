---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly16][previous meeting]]

Retirement of the OSG VOMS at IU. https://iggy.uits.indiana.edu/~tsilver/data_file lists to which VOMS sites are connecting. The OSG VOMS at IU will be retired at the end of August. GOC will be notifying sites that are still using the IU VOMS soon. A recent VO package will get these sites updated to refer to the OSG VOMS at Fermilab instead of IU.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO spotlight on DOSAR

Originally stood for DZero Southern Analysis Region, involved in DZero, ATLAS, and CMS. The list of active institutions and their role includes:

   * Iowa State - production and cluster development.

   * Louisiana - Louisiana State University using Louisiana optical network resources. They have one million CPU hours available for the next year which have been alloted for DZero and USATLAS.

   * Louisiana Tech ramping up for D0 and ATLAS production

   * Univ. of Oklahoma - very active in osg integration and production.

   * SPRACE (Sao Paulo, Brazil): Tier 2 Production and D0 Reprocessing

   * UT-Arlington :2 Production and Monitoring Software Development

   * University of Mississippi: Ramping up for D0 MC Production

OSCER - weather, bio-applications, material science applications are all very active.

2) VDT 1.6.1k update

An update to the Gratia probes which was release a little more than a week ago. But there is a problem with the instructions as they were sent out. The initial configuration of Gratia is done with the configure_osg, so the fix after running the pacman -update is to run congure_osg. Emails were sent to the GOC concerning those sites which are failing (55 sites). The site administrators were not notified via those emails, so GOC will send these tickets to the responsible Support Centers.

For pacman update commands see http://www.grid.iu.edu/news/news.php?id=323

3) OSG Site Administrators Technical Meeting at Fermilab next week

---++ OSG RA Items

GridAdmin interface access is via the specific certificate that is given to you. So you need to renew this access annually with your new certificate.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

1) Reporting through OSG to the SAM (Service Availability Monitoring for LCG) environment will probably be around September, although things may be in place before then. This is not the SAM related to DZero. More about SAM is available at http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/

2) We are going to advertise all OSG ITB nodes to the WLCG/BDII.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans

---+++ WLCG interoperability
