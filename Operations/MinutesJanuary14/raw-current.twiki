---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesDecember17][previous meeting]]

1. DOSAR VOMS update (_Horst_)
   * Horst did followup on the ticket but we&#39;re still experiencing problems, but Steve Timm is now able to contact their VOMS as of meeting time, but earlier this morning there were failures.

2. GIP data filter on BDII ITB Interoperability. Fermilab has been testing with FERMIGRID_ITB. The filter has taken out unwanted Glue attributes as expected.
   * This is working, but we still would like to have more testers. Additionally we need to verify that this will not affect interoperability. Anand &amp; Tim will followup with Burt and Tony.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. The GOC encourages all 0.8.0 sites to configure RSV

2. DOEGrids Old CA Expiration -- GOC VOMS/VORS outage Thursday, January 10th

The old VOMS version at the GOC did not pull the new certificate, so that lead to a VOMS server failure.

3. New VOMS template released last week includes updates to fmri, iVDGL, !GridEx, OSGEDU and MIS VOs.

All VO&#39;s should pull this package to grab these latest updates. We&#39;re anticipating removing the old VOMS in a couple of months.

---++ OSG RA Items

A reminder that the DOEGrids CA certificate expired last week, January 10. 

---++ Pending Registrations

None.
