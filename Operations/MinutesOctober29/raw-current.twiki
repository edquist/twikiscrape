No evidence has been seen that anyone tried to use the certificates that were on the machine, plus those certificates have now expired.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. VO spotlight on GROW

Anand will work on locating who is the manager of GROW VO. We&#39;ll reschedule for a future VO spotlight.

2. OSG version 0.8.0 release and upgrade plans

Release planned for next Thursday, November 1. FNAL plans to install the release on five gatekeepers with the other machines following within a week.

---+++ Other issues

1. Fermilab/USCMS &lt;-&gt; GOC ticket exchange

Tony at Fermilab has been working on Remedy (Fermilab/USCMS) &lt;-&gt; Footprints (GOC) ticket exchange. One scenario where a ticket in Remedy could be orphaned from a Footprints ticket. If &quot;Is this ticket ready to be closed?&quot; is not set to &quot;Yes&quot; the FP ticket is resolved, but the Remedy ticket is not. A future meeting will be scheduled so that the ticket exchange can be configured for greater efficiency.

- *Nothing new. A meeting is pending, but likely not until after the 0.8.0 release.*

2. Syslog project underway at the GOC.

3. Glue Schema update last week was completed and Burt and Rob have seen no issues.
