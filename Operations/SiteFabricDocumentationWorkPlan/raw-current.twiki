This is a work plan for how to expand and improve the documentation for Site and Fabric
Installation. This plan is being developed from the discussion which occurred OSG Site and Fabric Installation
parallel session at the consortium meeting.  See the SiteFabricDocumentationTable
for examples of documents that could be added.  Also add any ideas where existing documentation on the OSG CE 
could be improved.

---++Ideas that were raised in the session on 8/21
   * There are still lots of google-able documents from OSG 0.4.0 on the Mambo-based site that are outdated now, should get rid of them
   *  Need was expressed for a better indexing system besides Google.
   *  DOCDB documents are only useful if they&#39;re linked to the production documentation and people know where they are, else they don&#39;t get looked at.  Most people hadn&#39;t seen the two UCSD documents.
   *  We did not get time to discuss the scope of Trash/Trash/Integration activity documentation.  All should look at the stub documents that have been added to SiteFabricDocumentationTable and see which are candidates for joining the existing OSG Trash/Trash/Integration documentation set and which would be best put elsewhere.
