-- Main.ScottTeige - 17 Aug 2011

---+++ Announcements
   * Network outage rendered all services unavailable between 16:15 and 18:35 EDT, 16/Aug.


---+++ Accounting issues associated with the outage
   * All services, including monitoring continued to run through the network outage
   * Reported availability/reliability numbers do not reflect the actual availability/reliability of the services
      * We can add status change records to appropriate DBs
      * We can add a footnote to the monthly report

---+++ Glidein factory SLA
   * Changes are of 3 types:
      * Changes to non-data.These include condor code, glideinWMS code and validation scripts used by the glideins at various sites. These are subject to the usual change management processes.
      * Changes to data and meta-data that reflect the state of the grid and have no side effects.  Examples of these include disabling a decommissioned or misbehaving CE, adding a new CE on a already supported site, changing the max_walltime of the glideins, removing a VO from the site whitelist. These changes allow efficient scheduling of jobs and should never result in problems for the VOs. They are thus not subject to change management of any kind.
      *  Changes to data and meta-data that reflect the state of the grid that may have side effects. Examples of these include adding a new site, adding a VO to a site whitelist, re-enabling a site that was misbehaving in the past and enabling glexec at a site. It is of the nature of the service that these changes must be made as needed and the risk associated with each change will be left to the best judgment of the service administrators. Only if a change is deemed higher than normal risk, it will follow standard change management policies.
   * The glidein ITB instance will point to production resources. Minimally invasive test jobs (&quot;Hello World&quot;) will be executed via the MIS front-end to insure the functionality of the factory. After any changes to the ITB instance, stakeholders will be invited to test using the instance.
   * The UCSD instance will serve as the development instance of the service. If an &quot;experimental&quot; resource implemented there is shown to be workable, it will be implemented on the ITB instance and tested before moving to the production level.
   * Operations Lead, currently Scott Teige, will serve as primary point of contact. Changes not clearly of a routine nature or clearly covered by change management will be made in consultation with the Operations Lead. Problems effecting the status of the service will be communicated here.  Operations lead will provide communication to the community and escalate notification as appropriate.

---+++ CERN Glidein Factory
   * IU ITB Glidin Factory being installed today by Jeff. 
   * CERN Based - No news recently, I talked to Igor at the retreat, but have not heard anything since. 


---+++ BDII v5
   * Load still creeping up on is-itb1. Seems to have stablized on is-itb2 at ~4.
