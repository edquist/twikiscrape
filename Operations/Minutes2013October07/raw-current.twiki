---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Upgraded SDSC Factory to glideinWMS v3_2 (pre-release) and HTCondor to 8.0.2.
   * Discovered HTCondor-G bug that affects submission to cream and nordugrid sites if using OSG rpms for globus libraries.
      * nordugrid_gahp processes were stuck in busy loops, hogging cpu
      * Jaime Frey provided a patch and it will get into HTCondor 8.0.4
   * Discovered glideinWMS 3_2 bug where NordurgridRSL was not properly being passed on glidein submission.
      * glideinWMS developers provided a patch and it will be put into official v3_2 release.
   * SDSC disk became over 80% full. This was due to starting the new v3_2 instance. We cleared out all the logs from the old v2 instance freeing 100G.
      * Cleanup took ~7 hours. SDSC was in effective downtime on Friday during this time but the GOC and CERN factories continued to serve the frontends while SDSC was down.
