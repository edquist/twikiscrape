---+++ Tomorrow&#39;s Production Update
   * !MyOSG
      * Added GOC glidein service to the Operations Status Overview page. 
         * Still need to add UCSD Glidein Service. 
   * !InCommon HTTP/SSL certificates
      * We will be replacing various DOEGrids-issued HTTP/SSL certificates with our new !UserTrust/InCommon-issued certificates. This change was postponed from the previous update cycle due to OS updates. Affected services are myosg, oim, software, ticket, and twiki. !InCommon certificates are trusted on all major browsers by default and do not require users to manually trust our certificates anymore. In order to ensure a smooth transition, please start testing them on our ITB instances.

---+++ IUPUI Network Outage
   * Several network outages in IUPUI machine room 30/Jul
      * Loop condition in routers
      * Stable operation since late afternoon Saturday
      * Broadcast Message to IUPUI Machine Room users on August 2nd
&lt;pre&gt;
Greetings,

I wanted to send a note to customers served by the IUPUI Data Center who may have experienced brief service interruptions this past weekend. 
At this time, we are working with the vendor to determine the root cause. Meanwhile, we have taken interim measures to maintain stability.

Starting Saturday morning around 6:30am, we began experiencing intermittent issues with the router serving the IUPUI Data Center, requiring 
us to manually intervene to resolve the interruption. We immediately engaged our vendor, working with them throughout the weekend to identify 
and attempt to resolve the issue. Sunday morning around 10am, with assistance from the vendor, we identified a type of network traffic that instigated 
the events. We then took measures to limit those traffic sources. Since that time the network has been stable.  

It is important to note that this was normal network monitoring traffic used across campuses and not malicious in origin. The vendor is now working to 
determine the correlation between that traffic and the events that ensued.

We will continue to work with the vendor, providing them necessary data to assist in identifying the root cause and help them come to a long term solution.

I thank you for your patience in this matter,


David B. Hunter
