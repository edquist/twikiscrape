   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2009August17][Previous Meeting Minutes]]
   * Another notification went out to update OIM contact information. If you have not yet done this, please do so. Security contacts that have not responded will be targeted by the Operations and Security Team.

---++ Operations This Week
   * pyOpenSSL issue causes problems with RSV records on resources that do not have pyOpenSSL on system by default. This causes the Gratia transfer mechanism used by RSV to fail. This was put into the production cache on Friday evening and announced this afternoon.
   * VORS was removed from the network this morning and GridScan site verify tests were stopped. Please let us know if you are experiencing any issues so we can help you gather information from !MyOSG
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled release August 28th. We&#39;ve talked with Metrics and Gratia, we targeted several VOs last week, including STAR, Fermilab, NYSGrid, and SBGrid.

---++ Future Events
   * September Machine Room Move in Bloomington September 19 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG. This could be delayed until October 17th if it benefits anyone in the collaboration, the original date was picked with the idea of a October LHC turn up. 
      * ATLAS has confirmed this date is OK
      * Waiting for word from CMS
      * High probability that this will happen on October 17th and not September 19th
