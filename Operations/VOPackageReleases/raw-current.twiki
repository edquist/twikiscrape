The VO Package consist of two packages the OSG CE/SE/GUMS package and the OSG Client Package. The packages configure the resource to connect to authorization and authentication services.

   * edg-mkgridmap.osg (Used for resources using a Grid Map File)
   * gums-fqan.txt (Used by RSV Probes)
   * gums.template (Used by GUMS Servers)

   * vomses (Used buy voms-proxy-init)

And the VO Client consists of:
   * install-vo.sh (Installation Script)
   * vomses (Used buy voms-proxy-init)

---++ Release Workflow

The VO-Package is updated manually by the GOC as needed (requests for changes, additions and deletions are tracked via the ticket system) and sent to the ITB for testing before deployment. When ITB approves the package contents the GOC will release the packages into production.
