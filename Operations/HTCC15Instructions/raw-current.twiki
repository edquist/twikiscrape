---++ Introduction

This year&#39;s challenge is more of a breadcrumb trail than the standard research workflow done last year.  We will be using [[http://www.blender.org/][Blender]] to render various &quot;clues&quot; on OSG.  Those clues will eventually lead you to the finish line.

---++ Preliminary Steps

1) To enter the challenge, you must have an osg connect account. If you do not have one register at http://osgconnect.net/

2) You may work with a partner if you wish, but teams may not have more than 2 members. 

3) Email the following to kagross@iu.edu

   * Subject: HTCC Entry
   * Your name and and your partner&#39;s name, if applicable
   * Your osg connect username(s)

4) Go to the [[https://portal.osgconnect.net/Groups#id=0ee30ef6-ba96-11e3-849f-1231391ccf32][HTCC Group Page]] and join the HTCC group there.

---++ Challenge Instructions

1) Log in to OSG Connect (login.osgconnect.net) and use it as a submission mechanism for these jobs. 

2) DO NOT do any of the following:
   * download the program to your laptop and manipulate these files in the GUI. That is not the challenge.
   * run the jobs locally on the login node of OSG-Connect. You must have a full, working job submission workflow. 
   * target a specific resource. We don&#39;t want anyone to be able to manipulate the priority of their jobs.

3) When you create your submission file, do not target one specific resource to run your jobs. 

4) Submission file must contain the Challenge Project Name (+projectName = &quot;HTCC&quot;)

5) The application you are using for this challenge is a graphics program Blender and information on how to use it can be found at http://www.blender.org.

6) For your convenience, Blender can be setup using *modules*, or directly from OASIS: Blender is located at =/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/5.6.2/init/bash=.

7) None of the pictures or animations you&#39;re being asked to render contain audio.

8) We suggest the parameters: &lt;pre&gt;Requirements = (OpSysMajorVer =?= 6) &amp;&amp; (HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= TRUE)&lt;/pre&gt; in order to find a favorable execution environment on OSG.

---++ Using Blender/OSG, render the following files into pictures

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/htcc1.blend][htcc1.blend]]: the first file for this portion of the challenge

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/htcc2.blend][htcc2.blend]]: the second file for this portion of the demonstration

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/htcc3.blend][htcc3.blend]]: the third file for this portion of the demonstration

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/htcc4.blend][htcc4.blend]]: the fourth file for this portion of the demonstration


---++ Next steps

   * The four finished files, in order, will spell out your next destination =https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/_ _ _ _=
