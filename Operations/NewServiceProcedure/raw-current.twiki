---+++ Procedure for creating a new service

   * Request an IP address for the machine to host the service
      * send e-mail with request to dns-admin@indiana.edu
   * Obtain a machine
      * If physical machine is required, it will have to be acquired through purchasing
      * If a VM will suffice locate a suitable VM host, build the VM
   * Install and test the service on the machine
   * Create an install script and add it to the GOC SVN repository.
   * Write and test any required RSV metrics specific to the new service
      * Often, existing probes are sufficient.
      * Register any new metrics in OIM [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/metric][here]]
      * Add any new metrics to the GOC SVN repository
   * Create a new service type [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/serviceedit][here]] unless an existing service type is applicable
      * During creation of a service type critical metrics are specified
   * Register a new resource group [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/resourcegroup][here]] unless it is appropriate to add the new service to an existing resource group
   * Register a new resource [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/resource][here]] and configure it to have the service you&#39;ve registered
   * Enable all registered critical metrics on an RSV client.
   * Negotiate an appropriate Service Level Agreement, as required.
