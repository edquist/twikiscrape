| Name | Support Center | !ResURL | Site_Verify Status | Other Info |
| UColorado_HEP | CSC | | | &lt;p&gt; CMS Tier 3 resource. Currently the site has almost no resources, it will start with 7TB dCache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They run SGE on the other clusters and are trying to find a good way to reconcile that with the vast condor/globus usage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administrators plan to open this resource to non CMS resources.&lt;/p&gt; |
