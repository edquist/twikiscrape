---+++ Other issues

1. VOMS server status
   * Georgetown is upgrading their data center so their VOMS is down at the moment. They hope to be back up in the next day or so.
   * Horst will followup on the Dosar VOMS status, as it is also down at the moment.

2. GIP data filter on BDII ITB Interoperability. Fermilab will be testing with FERMIGRID_ITB. This filters out unwanted Glue attributes that are sent to the GOC&#39;s aggregator.
