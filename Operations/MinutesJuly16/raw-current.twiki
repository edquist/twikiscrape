---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly9][previous meeting]]

Reminder to register for the upcoming OSG Site Administrators Technical Meeting at Fermilab (July 30, 31). The hope is to have at least one admin from each site. Information and registration is available at https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=866

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) Retirement of the OSG VOMS at IU

Prior to two months ago, the OSG VOMS was hosted at IU. It is now hosted at Fermilab. At the end of this month we are turning off the OSG VOMS. By the end of the month sites that haven&#39;t pulled a new VO package since about April (or perhaps June because of VOMS configuration issues at Fermilab) will need to update their site(s). GOC will review the server logs to see what sites are still contacting the VOMS at IU.

There are still some links out there directing users to join the OSG VOMS at IU, whereas they should be going to Fermilab. GOC will work on correcting these links.

2) VO spotlight on DZero

They have been using Monte Carlo resources for quite a while and would like to maximize efficiency, plus add more applications to OSG in the future. Also they plan to use Fermilab resources for data processing. Resource control and prioritizing are large issues with primary processing, which they are hoping the troubleshooting team will assist with. They also want to get better monitoring of jobs and not just accounting information, which is what seems to be available now. Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA was close to providing the type of data they are looking to gain, but it is deprecated and they haven&#39;t found a tool that serves as a replacement for gathering those statistics. Is there a tool in the works to replace it? OSG is building tools with the site availability project to provide similar data, but that is still in development. Also a lot of the data ML is pulling is included in the Glue information in the GIP.

One of the most important requests that DZero can make is having the renewed support of the troubleshooting team for our future activities on the OSG. We plan to include more and more applications to run on the OSG. The troubleshooting team was instrumental to making the operational load for the data reprocessing manageable.

1) Reporting through OSG to the SAM (Service Availability Monitoring for LCG) environment will probably be around September, although things may be in place before then. This is not the SAM related to DZero. More about SAM is available at http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/
