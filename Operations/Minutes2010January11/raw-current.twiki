   * Last week&#39;s status history 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yejwd2j][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector]] - NOTE: After delays due to holidays, etc. GOC has fixed minor bug that was causing service availability to be miscalculated in isolated cases.
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ybo4sjd][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/01/osg-125-release-notice.html][OSG 1.2.5 was released last week]]
   * Relevant to only WLCG Interop sites: SAM team has indicated there was a broker problem between Jan 8th 11:00 and Jan 9th 13:00 (UTC) that may be causing bad LCG availability numbers; GOC will resend RSV records, and SAM team will recompute numbers.
   * On continued examination of the case where sites stopped reporting properly to one of the collectors we&#39;ve decided to wait to hear more from the gratia developers before pinging the 40-some affected sites with tickets.
