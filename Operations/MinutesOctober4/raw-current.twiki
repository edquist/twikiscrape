---++  Joint OSG-EGEE Operations Workshop (27-29 Sept 2005)

Final agenda (http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a054670) with links to presentations.

---+++ Topics
   * Metrics - how to measure quality, progess, performance (work can be done in this area)
      * metrics for services and not just resource usage
      * baseline performance, are the functional tests measuring end user performance
      * (seems like a TG-MIG topic)
   * Process for new service integration
      * OSG has a process, how to find the effort?
      * EGEE looking into it (a ticklist), how to prioritize things
         * OSG could/should have such a ticklist for service rediness plan &amp; provisioning (a topic for general interoperability for now)
      * opportunity for cooperation
   * Ticket exchange - user support workflow
      * Agreed that OSG is not a ROC (EGEE Regional Ops Center)
      * GGUS ticket system &amp; OSG Footprints should exchange tickets
         * technical interface issues can proceed in parallel with how support models map at a higher level
         * GGUS email notifications will be one of the related issues
         * RAL is using Footprints and some cooperation with them is sensible
   * VO Boxes, edge services
      * EGEE working process of getting feedback from sites (by this Friday)
      * Does OSG have or need a process for this? Should OSG assist in VO-resource provider relations?
   * Interoperability of info service/resource monitoring
      * Leigh &amp; Oliver have success in integrating testbeds &amp; cross grid resource access
         * mostly for LCG use of OSG resources
         * application test phase of ITB should validate the inter-grid functionality
         * job monitoring interoperability is down the road (perhaps June)
         * don&#39;t yet have worked out how top-level grid monitoring tools interface or interact
      * GLUE V2
      * Are the goals clear?  Do VOs know how they intend to spread workload across grids?
         * service readiness plan for GIP (not clear how interoperability fits in)
         * operations implementation goals are not yet clear
   * Cookbook - EGEE grid cookbook fits in with OSG knowledgebase - Lisa
      * how to coordinate this type of activity across two grids?
      * Lisa has written a table of contents
      * - put on tg-sc meeting for next week

   * Monitoring - OSG did not have good representation for monitoring


---+++ Planning for a next meeting/workshop

My view (D.O.) - understand workgroups &amp; goals, then plan meetings as face-to-face working
meetings of these workgroups, perhaps with summary reports in plenary session.

Question of &quot;January joint workshop&quot; is open &amp; there are some date conflicts not yet resolved.

---++ Operations Activity Issues

---+++ bug fix SOP

Looks like Critical SOP with some mods could be made to work for rapid deployment bug fixes

---++ Community Support Activity Issues

Meeting tomorrow.

Fred had got some volunteers for the top questions for the KB test.
