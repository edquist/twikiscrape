-- Main.ScottTeige - 02 Nov 2010

---++ Announcements
   * BDII instability event on 26/Oct. The problem was traced back to a IP renumbering project which had unforeseen effects on our internal DNS and LDAP. As soon as the issue was identified, the maintenance was stopped and service was rolled back to the pre-maintenance configuration. This was complicated by the need to roll back several RPM packages. 
      * A munin plug-in with an alarm has been created to enhance detection of similar events.
   * OIM outage 14:30-18:36 29/Oct. Tomcat failed without generating a log entry. Tomcat restarted, service is running.
      * Some local use only probes will be updated to address this issue
   * Top level BDII had stale data from ~2:00 to 9:00 on 2/Nov. Tomcat restart at BNL resolved the problem.
