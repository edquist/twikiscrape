   * 2269 Fermi/Remedy - 82585 - goc@opensciencegrid.org forwarding
      * The GOC is moving to a new mail server. We are testing now by forwarding email from the existing server to the new mail server. All aliases at Fermilab will need to be directed to the new mail server. So at this time we&#39;re working on defining those aliases. What progress is being made at Fermilab to identify the aliases?

   * 2305 NWICG-NotreDame Resource/Service Registration
      * Reviewed. Approved. Will be added to monitoring tools such as GridCat.

   * GridCat - sites are on it that should be removed. If they send email to the GOC we will open a ticket(s).
