---++Operations Activity Issues

0.2 had an operations plan, we should revisit that for 0.4 and refine it for 0.4
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=72][Operations Plan for 2005]]
Leith will take a pass at it, and compare to model doc.

May need to update the model document as well.

0.4 release date is Dec. 31, see provisioning [[Provisioning.ProvisioningDocs0dot4][timeline]]

---++ Other topics

---+++ Policy URLs
For sites &amp; VOs, how to get them into use?

Examples:
   * [[http://www.ivdgl.org/~ivdgl/ivdgl-vo-privilege.html][iVDGL]]
   * [[http://online.star.bnl.gov/STAR/comp/grid/infrastructure/star-vo-privilege-configuration/][STAR]]
   * [[PolicyPublicationTrust.WebHome][Policy Publication &amp; Trust Twiki]]

Necessary client side package is included in 0.4.  I could be done as an update over 0.2.1 but that would need some testing/checking. This update will be left for after the 0.4 release.

Stu Fess is working on PPT and will put together a site policy template.  Burt will check with Stu.

Page should describe the common elements and ncessary content rather than overall page format.

---+++ Blank registration fields

Some registrations are entered with blank fields.  For resources we need some information for running the gridcat tests, but we don&#39;t validate every field.  Security group is going to verify existing info. We should define a validation process &amp; completion status. An indication of registration completeness can be put in http://osg-vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi.
Doug&#39;s homework to update the workflow diagram, need to think about how to actually display completion.
