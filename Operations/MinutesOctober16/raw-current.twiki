---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesOctober9][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:
Vanderbilt problems with getting jobs into the queue continue. Jobs not getting into the queue. Brazil sites failing authentication.

   * *This week*: UERJ network problems resolved. Steve has jobs running at UNM, but Tim at UNM doesn&#39;t see any jobs running. The last production job finished two days ago (Oct 14). LIGO is seeing Steve&#39;s jobs in the queue. Steve started another group of jobs Friday after the others completed. These issues will be taken offline, with the GOC being included on updates.

2) OSG scheduled maintenance tool
   * Doug suggested that anyone with a DN be allowed to submit maintenance. We support the idea of multiple DN&#39;s per site, but supporting any valid DN for any VO is something we need to discuss further.

3) GROW VO support
   * Sites are advertising support of the GROW VO, but GROW jobs fail at those sites.
   * The GOC sent out a general announcement last week asking VOs to support GROW.
   * Eric reports that Ransom submitted some trouble requests to the GOC.
   * He also wanted to know if walltimes or cpu times could be increased at site and if so, how do we ask sites to do so? The GOC can create tickets for the Support Centers (site admins in the case of Community Suppport).

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG usage spotlight on GADU (not in attendance)

2) Super Computing Planning
   * We would like to pull together a schedule of presentations that will be given at SC06. Contact Rob Quick.
      * UNM (Tim Thomas)
      * Iowa (Eric and Shaowen)

---++ OSG RA Items

---++ [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/tickets][Tickets]]

   * 2577 - Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID _nanoHUB_
      * Plans to update your scripts to utilize voms-proxy-init so that your jobs will not continue to fail at the two Fermilab sites which are now using SAZ?
      * Someone made an adjustment that has allowed a job to run on FNAL_FERMIGRID, but Steve at nanoHUB checked Friday and nanoHUB is still working on resolving the problem.

   * 2112 - Fermi/Remedy - 80086 - [vdt-support #1750] Some CRLs returning HTTP error 302 _VDT and/or USCMS_
      * USCMS and VDT not in attendance.
