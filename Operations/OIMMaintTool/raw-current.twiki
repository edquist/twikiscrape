%ICON{hand}% This document is a brief discussion of the Resource Maintenance Tool in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryO#DefsOpenScienceGridInformationManagement][OIM]]

---++ Introduction to the OIM Scheduled Maintenance Tool

The [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OSG Information Management (OIM)]] project has implemented a scheduled maintenance tool. It is important for OSG Users and Operations to have accurate records for scheduled resource maintenance times. This will help users schedule jobs and operations to accurately calculate reports and not penalize resources for routine scheduled maintenance.

You will only be able to schedule maintenance for registered resources if you are listed as an administrator of that resource in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryO#DefsOpenScienceGridInformationManagement][OIM]].

NOTE: To access the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryO#DefsOpenScienceGridInformationManagement][OIM]] system you will need to have a valid OSG approved  certificate loaded into your browser.

---++ Adding a New Maintenance Window

To access the maintenance records for your resource follow the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryO#DefsOpenScienceGridInformationManagement][OIM]] menu. *Registrations -&gt; Resources -&gt; Your Resources -&gt; _Resource Name_ -&gt; Maintenance*. This will show you all current maintenance records for the _Resource Name_ you have selected. 

To add a new maintenance window click on the *Add Maintenance* link. 

From the page you will choose the service that will be out (ie. Compute Element, SRM V1 Storage Element...), the Severity based on the outage time you expect (Outage, Intermittent Outage, No Outage Expected), the Start and End time of the maintenance in UTC/GMT, and a description of the maintenance. 

When this information is entered click the *Add Maintenance* link to submit the window. 

Your maintenance record should now show in the *Registrations -&gt; Resources -&gt; Your Resources -&gt; _Resource Name_ -&gt; Maintenance* menu.

---++ Deleting a Maintenance Window

Click *Cancel Maintenance* on the maintenance window you would like to delete from the *Registrations -&gt; Resources -&gt; Your Resources -&gt; _Resource Name_ -&gt; Maintenance* menu.

Confirm you would like to cancel this maintenance by clicking *Yes*.

---++ Modifying a Maintenance Window

Click the *Edit* link on the maintenance window you would like to modify from the *Registrations -&gt; Resources -&gt; Your Resources -&gt; _Resource Name_ -&gt; Maintenance* menu.

Update any fields you would like to modify and click *Update Maintenance* when you have made modifications.
