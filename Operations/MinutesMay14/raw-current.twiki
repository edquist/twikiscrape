---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesMay7][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO Spotlight on CDF - one of two big experiments at tevatron. transitioning from private to grid computing. Two submission points one outward from FNAL and one inward toward FNAL resources. using glexec would like to be able to use roles. MC jobs with a glide-in mechanism. Agreements with sites that involved with the experiment, mostly CMS and ATLAS. No effective way to move files back. Looking at a couple of ideas to fix issue with stalling sites. Reconstruction is done on private farms currently, going to be migrated out to Fermigrid. 

2) DZero Production Run Update - Getting close to completion. About 3 million events, LONI is still down, SPRASE is still down. 85% done, almost all datasets have crashed at some level. This is a effort issue, not a resource issue. Still hoping to finish by the end of the month.  

3) OSG sites upgraded to 0.6.0

4) OSG Site Admin Meeting July 30/31

---++ OSG RA Items

None this week.

---++ Pending Registrations

---+++ VOs

NYSGRID
   * EB approved. Supported by GRASE. Info is complete.
   * Steve represented and said this is a different user group than GRASE, but same VOMS and support center. 

---+++ Resources

1) Purdue-Caesar
   * Production CE supported by NWICG. Info is complete.
   * Fails authentication. Kevin will make sure the site admin has enabled the MIS VO and then get with us if it still does not authenticate.

2) cinvestav
   * Production CE supported by DOSAR. 
   * Resource URL goes to an Apache test page. Info complete otherwise. 
   * Authenticating correctly. Mexico. 3 Machines, installed CE, adding SE soon. A couple more compute elements added soon. New 25 node cluster around end of year. Mexican institutions involved with CMS. 

3) BNL_ATLAS_SE
   * Production SE supported by USATLAS. Info is complete.
   * OSG VOs have 5 Terabytes, dcache.

---+++ USCMS

3167 Fermi/Remedy - 93365 - Authentication failure at Nebraska
   * User still cannot get authentication with a voms-proxy with plain CMS membership and no roles. No update from CMS since 5/2.
   * Nebraska has recently updated to 0.6.0 and is authenticating OK now. 

---+++ NanoHUB/Fermilab

2577 Fermi/Remedy 91402 - Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID
   * Updates consist of nothing more than &quot;Work Log.&quot;  No real update since 4/03
   * This is still in progress, and may take several months to fix. Valarie working the issue. 

3502 GUGrid is now passing and this ticket can be closed. 

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

Agenda: http://indico.cern.ch/categoryDisplay.py?categId=258

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans

---+++ WLCG interoperability

Probes are being written that will enable site level testing that can be gathered by the WLCG SAM interface. More to come next week.
