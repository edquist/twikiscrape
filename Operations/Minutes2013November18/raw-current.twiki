---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Upgraded GOC Production factory to glideinWMS 3.2.2 on November 12th
      * Munin shows a slight increase in total CPU and memory usage in v3 vs v2, but we still have a good amount of %idle CPU and free memory available.
      * We still have no explanation for why swap space slowly fills up but overall the rate of swapping looks much lower in v3.
      * Now all production factories are running v3, so frontends can start upgrading to glideinWMS v3 as well.
   * Made HTCondor 8.0.x the default for glideins to use in all factories.
