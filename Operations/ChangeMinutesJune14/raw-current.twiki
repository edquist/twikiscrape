-- Main.ScottTeige - 14 Jun 2011

---+++ New Meeting Time
   * Meetings to be moved to Monday 2:30 eastern time effective Monday 20/Jun 

---+++ !MyOSG Outage
   * One instance ran out of memory, removed from DNS RR. People may have observed long response times. VM restarted with twice the memory.
   * When the second instance was to be removed from RR, IU DNS administrators erroneously removed _both_ instances from RR. !MyOSG became invisible sometime after 3:00 eastern Friday. The problem was corrected at 4:00.
   * The second instance had its memory doubled this morning.

---+++ Bug fix policy
   * Defining bug as &quot;Any behavior of the applications which deviates from the common expectation of users.&quot;
   * Is goc allowed to implement the patch at any time, particularly, as soon as it is detected?
