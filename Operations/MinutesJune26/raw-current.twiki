---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJune19][previous meeting]]

---+++ Large OSG resource request for nanoHUB update (Steven Clark)

Steve, would you like to give us an update? How many jobs have been submitted/completed and what sites were they submitted to? Also, how many jobs are you still planning to run at each site? I know you&#39;re working with LIGO now on running the jobs; you will need to checkpoint jobs because walltime is limited to 12-24 hours, depending on queue.

   * !NanoHUB jobs running at UWM, PU Physics, PSU, Vanderbilt
   * 200 jobs currently running, 10 have completed of the 1800 scheduled
   * OSG GOC and Steve Clark with TACC, !CalTech and now GRASE about access to those systems
   * Some modifications to job lenght were made to match PBS queue Wall Clock time
   * Fermilab systems advertising support (via gums generated grid3-vo-user-map.txt) 
     Steve indicated that the lqcd.fnal.gov site does not support NanoHUB even though 
     it is advertising support. The FNAL gums service is not host specific causing the
     mis-information to be published.


---+++ GRASE upgrade to 0.4.1.

   * GRASE systems currently available:
      * GRASE-BINGHAMTON
      * GRASE-CCR-U2
   * GRASE systems to be online soon:
      * GRASE-ALBANY
