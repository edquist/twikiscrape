   * Dan, Rob Q, Fred, Chander, Scott, Kyle

---++ 3rd BDII v4
   * Machine should be ready on Thursday and BDII v4 shortly afterward. 
      * We want to be careful the previous BDII v5 running on this machine does not conflict with the new BDII v4 so we are reinstalling from scratch. 
      * Ready for deployment on February 22nd or afterward. 

---++ TWiki authentication
   * Will install overhauled authentication module in TWiki to implement FNAL certs fix on February 22nd.
   * Fix is available for testing [[https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/TwikiAuthenticationTest][here]]
      * Steve T, Keith C have both tested successfully.

---+++ TWiki Side Note
   * Docs group is examining  [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiReleaseNotes05x00#New_Features_Highlights][TWiki V5]] to form an opinion as to how to proceed.

---++ Operations this week
   * ITB Operations Services release this week
      * GOC Ticket 1.33
      * OIM 2.31
      * MyOSG 1.31
   * OS patches on ITB instances, a reboot is required.
   * Problems with RSV in 1.2.17, some sites incorrectly reported as unknown.
      * Working to correct the RSV reports

---++ Top Level BDII at the GOC
   * Flavia reports a &quot;semi-static&quot; version of BDII will be developed to be deployed for testing. 
   * This makes me think the top-level BDII plan is not ready for deployment.
