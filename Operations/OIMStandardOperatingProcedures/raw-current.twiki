%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators and grid users. It explains how to use the %LINK_OIM% to register users, resources, virtual organizations and vital contacts with the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryG#DefsGridOperationsCenter][Grid Operations Center (GOC)]].

---+ Requirements

   1. All procedures require a personal [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCertificate][PKI/X509 security certificate]] that has been issued for you to use for personal identification by one of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authorities (CAs)]] trusted by the %LINK_OSG%. There is information about which [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CAs]] we accept on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/CaDistribution][this page]] and how to get a new certificate on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateUserGet][this page]].
   1. You must additionally have some way of managing your certificate, such as a browser that will import it directly, a mac keychain and keychain-compatible browser, or some other kind of certificate manager and its appropriate browser.

| 2. Is there an OSG [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] issued Cert in the browser? | If a certificate is present, OIM will examine the certificate and compare it to the current registration data. If not, the user will be prompted to return to the site with an OSG [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] issued certificate loaded in the browser. |
| 3. Is [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryD#DefsDistinguishedName][DN]] already in OIM? | If the user&amp;rsquo;s [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryD#DefsDistinguishedName][Distinguished Name (DN)]] that appears on his or her certificate is already entered in OIM, then the user has already been approved by the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryG#DefsGridOperationsCenter][GOC]].

If not, the user is prompted to enter personal information. |

---+ How to register a Resource with the OIM?

The process begins at the OIM portal. OIM uses the OSG [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] issued certificate in a browser or keychain to establish the identity of the user. OIM then compares the information in the certificate against the registered users database to determine whether the visitor is a registered user or not. 

| Step in Process | Explanation | 
| 1. Is the user registered? | If the user is registered, she or he will be able to authenticate and proceed into the registered user area of OIM. If not, the user will be prompted to complete the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMStandardOperatingProcedures#Personal_Registration_in_OIM][personal registration process.]] |
| 2. Is the resource located at a registered facility? | If the facility is registered, the user may select or register a site. If not, the user must first register a facility by going to the &quot;Facilities&quot; section of OIM, choosing to &quot;Add a New Facility&quot; and entering a name and description for their institution. |
| 3. Does the resource use a registered, active site? | If the site is ready, the user may select or register a resource group. If it is not registered, the user must first register a new site by going to the &quot;Sites&quot; section of OIM, choosing to &quot;Add a New Administrative Site&quot; and entering a facility, short name, site description, support center and street address for their site (choose CSC for support center if no support center currently exists). If it the site is registered but deactivated, the user must contact goc@opensciencegrid.org to request to have a deactivated site reactivated, as applicable |
| 4. Does the resource use a registered, active resource group? | If the resource group is ready, the user may register a new resource. If it it not registered, the user must first register a new resource group by going to the &quot;Resource Groups&quot; section of OIM, choosing to &quot;Add a New Resource Group&quot; and entering a name for the resource group, selecting a site, choosing production or ITB status, and adding a description. If the resource group is registered, but deactivated. The user must contact goc@opensciencegrid.org to request to have a deactivated site reactivated, as applicable |
| 5. Enter Resource information | After clicking the &quot;Resources&quot; heading and choosing to add a new resource, the user will be prompted to enter resource information. See the detailed information here for help with the fields [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMRegistrationInstructions#Resource_or_Service_Registration][here.]] A ticket is created and the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryG#DefsGridOperationsCenter][GOC]] must review this information.  |
| 6. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryG#DefsGridOperationsCenter][GOC]] Review and Confirm Relationship to OSG | The [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryG#DefsGridOperationsCenter][GOC]] will respond to any incomplete or inaccurate resource registrations with a request to update the registration information. The [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryG#DefsGridOperationsCenter][GOC]] will filter out any inappropriate or spam registrations, accept complete and accurate registration information and the resource will be activated and included in the next Operations meeting agenda. At this time the Operational Contacts are subscribed to the osg-general, osg-sites, and osg-ops-status mailing lists. |
| 7. Representation at Ops meeting? | Generally, the registration ticket will remain open until a representative attends the weekly Operations meeting to answer any questions and give a brief introduction of the resource. The submitter is notified of status. However, this requirement is sometimes deemed unnecessary when the resource provider is familiar with OSG practices and operations and has already announced the resource to his or her user community. |

The OSG Users Group is tasked with understanding the context and expectation of the new VO. They recommend to the EB when/whether the registration be accepted. Once approval is granted, the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryV#DefsVirtualOrganization][VO]] is activated and the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryV#DefsVirtualOrganization][VO]] continues to the next step. |
| 6. Test [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryV#DefsVirtualOrganization][VO]] Infrastructure, Representation at Ops Meeting and Trash/Integration into OSG software | When the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/GlossaryV#DefsVirtualOrganizationManagementSystem][Virtual Organization Membership System (VOMS)]] is working and any problems have been resolved through the Operations meeting, the community will be notified and the VO package will be updated.  If this process is incomplete, the user will be notified.
