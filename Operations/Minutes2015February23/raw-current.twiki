---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

---++ Security
   * Lenovo Superfish vulnerability/explot is pretty scary. Doesn&#39;t affect OSG directly though,
   * Digicert sha2 intermediate testing ongoing. Successfully tested with SL6/OSG3.1 CE. Issues with SL5/OSG3.1 related to java/SSL version. Don&#39;t believe this has anything to do with the cert, but will continue to try to get a positive confirmation.
   * New IGTF release this week with HIAST CA temporarily removed. should make it into the March OSG release.
