---++Grid Monitoring &amp; Performance

Determine what aspects of displays to include in weekly review.

Ruth suggested we review the monitoring. 

---+++ Gridcat status
http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/

Site verify script for SE. Do we have a common understanding of what an SE is... Some values are defined. SRM or GSI in and out, LDAP. Bockjoo listed 11-12 fields that GridCat queries. Personal cert in MIS VO. How can we facilitate troubleshooting of production services. Monitoring system development issue with GridCat. Should these issues be worked out on the ITB? Can we put people in the MIS VO to do debugging? UCSD is doing something that will have an ITB node connected to their SE. Bockjoo should be given access by the local site not through the MIS VO.

Link that explains why a site is green or red. 

Is there a place that explains which sites need special access. Policy URL is coming from Grid3 information provider. This is a script change we could do a patch if we needed too. Can be done with a package update. Policy publication and trust on Twiki. This should be discussed in the Trash/Deployment meeting.
