---+++OSG Role 

---+++Operations Activity&#39;s Role

Sidebar: OSG Model is build to work for everyone, while there are exceptions such as USCMS and ATLAS. Facility, fabric level where do you report the problem? How will the ROCs know where to open ticket. VO level support is modeled by each individual VO. Details should be hammered out before the OSG/EGEE meeting.

Lower level cutoff for support centers. There are users that will not be supported under VO SC structure. Calls will possibly take the Wednesday time slot vacated by operations.

---++Registration DB Update

http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/othertools/registration/pull/pull.php

Doug will do some initial modification and Rob will follow up.

---++Knowledge Base Update

   * Anne has looked at Remedy system nice in that it is simple and configurable, files can be added. No cost other than floating license and yearly fee. Authentication might be necessary.

   * Knowledge Book has multimedia capabilities. Developed at Fermi. Anne is trying to get an instance running to evaluate.

   * Flat pages with Google search, would take more upfront time. 

   * Plone might be made to function as a knowledge base. Possibly with the proper plugin. Has basic infastructure.

We do not have a list of requirements for the KB. Not terribly well defined. Question/Answer type interface.

All of these options are dependant on the amount of funding. There needs to be some level of pledged/paid support.


---++Other Topics

---+++Using Grid Certs for Trouble Ticket Authentication

Rob will talk with Kyle and Marc about authentication to the registration DB. Contact pages by DOE cert CA, and editing by individual DN.
