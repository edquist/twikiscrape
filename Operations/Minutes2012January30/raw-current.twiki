---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Discovered unexpected behavior where condor-g does not forward updated proxy to CE unless there is &lt; 6h left on it even if it was updated on submit node.
      * This creates a window where glideins fail because gwms internally sets a 12h lower limit for minimum time left on a proxy a glidein is allowed to start with.
      * Jaime Frey gave us a gridmanager to test that allows us to change the 6h condor limit.  We will test it this week.
      * We notified gwms developers as well.

   * Fifth Tuesday, no release.
   * opensciencegrid.org Domain transfer to IU postponed to February 28th maintenance window. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OpenScienceGridWeb][Planning Document]]
   * Meeting to design new www.opesciencegrid.org webpage scheduled next week.
   * Meeting to discuss Condor usage Gratia probes scheduled for Wednesday morning [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-34][Ticket]].

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
