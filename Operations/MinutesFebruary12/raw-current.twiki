---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesFebruary5][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on mariachi

2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus

   * *Last week*: Still having issues at UNM because of the time discrepancy between Condor (minutes) and PBS (a different format). Requested time is 880 minutes, but was being treated as something like 880 hours. Two jobs have given an error of not having enough disk space, but that shouldn&#39;t be the actual issue. Seven jobs at Purdue, four having problems. And a few jobs at Venderbilt with trouble running internal script argument files, which he has contacted them about.

   * Issues have been resolved at UNM, so the ticket can be closed.  Also Vanderbilt&#39;s problem was figured out.  Purdue&#39;s problem has not been figured out.  One file will not transfer, haven&#39;t figure out why.  Looks to perhaps be a Globus issue, but haven&#39;t heard back.  UNM&#39;s problem was in PBS.pm.  Local customization was incorrect.  Vanderbilt&#39;s problem was a similar issue.  The log files were filling up ...a patch messed up the files, so the jobs couldn&#39;t run because the log files couldn&#39;t be found.

3) DZero Production Run Update

   * RobQ will get Parag a list of sites with posted policies so that he can see how many jobs can be run per day.  They are running


4) Request for increased support of Engage and GROW

   * Burt did not get request at support center.  GROW should support across CMS.  Burt will look at  VORS and see if info is up to date for supporting engage.  Engage wants to be out ASAP. 
   * Eric has seen some increased support for GROW.  Purdue supports them now.  Ransom is trying to do a run today/tomorrow to see what additional sites are up and supporting GROW.
   * USATLAS - the ATLAS support list did see this request
   * STAR - talked about supporting GROW, but not many site admins were there.  STAR-BNL will not support them., other sites can, but must be individual users.

   * *This week*:
