---++ Requirements for Operational Status Display

During the Operational Review Conducted at FNAL on May 26th and 27th a request was made for OSG Operations to provide a high level status display of Operational Services. Below are the requirements. 

   * This display should be able to provide the user an quick, high level view of the Health of Operational Services in OSG.
      * The display should fit within one browser page (no vertical or horizontal scrolling) and be compatible with IE, Safari, and Firefox
         * If this requirement proves to be too stringent for the allotted time budget, it can be relaxed to fit within a 1440x900 display and Firefox.
      * Each service should be in one of the stated already defined by OIM (OK, CRITICAL, WARNING, MAINTENANCE)
      * Service status should be represented by a single icon and color.  Icon/color combination should be colorblind-friendly.
   * Information should eventually include all Operational Services, though an initial version may start as a subset. These services may include, but are not limited to:
      * OSG Operational Services at the IU GOC
      * OSG Security Operations Services
      * OSG Accounting and Information Services at FNAL
      * OSG IT Administrative Services at the GOC and FNAL
      * The OSG WMS Glide In Factory at UCSD
      * Engage Services that are used by multiple VOs
    All services on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]] not listed as &quot;Services Used by Specific VOs&quot; will be covered.
   * All information should be concise and categorized by it&#39;s criticality (as determined in the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]])
   * Historical details should be reachable via drill down.
   * Service state is defined by the SLAs for the service (if it exists; otherwise, it is up to the GOC team to decide).  Typically, this is an AND of all the critical (RSV) metrics.
   * If service status information does not go through the existing OSG Opsinfrastructure (i.e. RSV), this must be approved by OSG management.
