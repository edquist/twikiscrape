   * *Ticket Exchange*
      * GOC-TX server outage on Saturday - GOC investigating -- *no GGUS tickets were impacted*
      * GGUS - no updates, working properly
      * BNL - no updates, working properly - some more discussion between GOC Infrastructure and Jason
      * FNAL - Further tests using FNAL provided script, still no success to report yet

---++++ Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by FermiGrid Ops)
   * Slowdown of half of !ReSS service over the weekend between 6/11 and 6/14,  !ReSS service remained available due
       to high availability features.  We have updated auto-correction script which should prevent slowdowns like this in future.
   * !ReSS machines will have kernel update on 6/17/10, HA features will keep !ReSS up.
   * Gratia machines will delay kernel update pending new Gratia release forthcoming in a couple of weeks, which will partially
       address issues of the reporting database being behind the collector database during housekeeping.
      * Fermilab anticipates an 5-10 minute outage, but everything should recover itself, we will send an announcement
