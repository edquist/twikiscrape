---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesOctober23][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  UNM issues resolved. Jobs weren&#39;t actually running, but now they are. Similar issue with Vanderbilt and some jobs ran, but more jobs should be running and nothing has since Thursday (10/19; GOC will create a ticket. Still having issues at Buffallo and he is waiting to hear back from Steve. Brookhaven is accepting jobs. Jaime is still working with nanoHUB on some unresolved Globus errors.
   * NanoHUB would like to run on sites providing Condor as the batch system in the condor standard Universe.
     Is this supported via the OSG software as deployed?

   * *This week*: Vanderbilt is running jobs again; the site was down. Overall things are improving. Buffalo (GRASE) is trying to figure out why jobs aren&#39;t running there, but they&#39;re looking into it.
   
2) A reminder regarding Super Computing planning
   *  Rob is putting together a [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/meetings/sc06.php][schedule]] of presentations.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG usage spotlight on USCMS
   * Big physics experiments starting at the LHC at CERN. International resources: 7 tier 2s, 2 tier 1 at Fermilab. Rio and Brazil tier 2s in S. America. Simulation effort has only been running at CMS-branded sites. Simulated and real data coming next year.

2) Discuss the technical aspects relating to the RSS Feeds.
   * Some readers don&#39;t like the feed link. Various RSS readers handle the feeds differently. Safari, Firefox 2.0, Thunderbird and other software the GOC has tested read the link, but some readers may not work.

3) PBS security concern and available updates.
   * PBS Pro and Open PBS had the same problem. A fix has been released in the newer versions/releases. If sites are running PBS, they should patch these installations by getting a newer, patched version. Support Centers should be contacting sites and asking them to patch their systems.

---++ OSG RA Items

No items.

---++ Pending Registrations

   * VO *Engage* and its SC: *Engagement*
      * EB approved both.
      * No representation. Table this for next week.
   * Resource: HWI _approved_
      * GRASE supported.
      * Production CE.
      * Cluster installed. Part of the NY state grid. They&#39;re going to submit a host cert request. GOC will add to monitoring once they pass tests.

---++ [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/tickets][Tickets]]

   * 2666 - VORS inconsistency re FNAL_FERMIGRID and FNAL_GPFARM
      * Support not listed when selecting DZero VO view.

---++ Other issues

1) New VORS is in development at http://vors-dev2.grid.iu.edu  
   * Send comments or bugs to the GOC.

2) Disk clean-up. 
   * What do VOs do to deal with the issue of jobs not cleaning up after themselves? Some sites use the find command to cleanup jobs after a specified period in which the jobs aren&#39;t retrieved. This could be added to the site policy URL. No data should be in $home. OSG_DATA and OSG_APP are places for storing such data. The overall issue is a Globus issue.

3) Do worker nodes need or require network access? 
   * Several VOs do expect outgoing network access from worker nodes. GRASE doesn&#39;t allow network access from their worker nodes, it&#39;s all done via the gatekeeper.
