There is an ACDC tutorial online. We should review without experts and see what comments we have. Rob will add this to the regular agenda.

---++Further discussion on GridCat SE update

*Should testing be done on Production or ITB?* It is currently being run on the ITB, but consensus is that it should be done on the production OSG to confirm all services work before a switch. John R is setting up an instance that will be reviewed tomorrow on the Support Centers Call, and then replace the old version soon afterward.

*There should also be another track for issues that are not critical (security or crash issue) and service change (minor fix or feature upgrade).* This should be addressed along with a time period for this intermediate state (24 hours and 48 hours and 1 week were possibilities with one week being too long). The current SOP for critical upgrades should probably have a non-critical branch. The operation call should discuss which branch (normal service change or high priority service change) is chosen.
