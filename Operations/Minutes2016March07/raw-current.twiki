---++++ Grid Operations Center
   *  ITB release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2016/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-march-8-2016.html][Release note]], to production this week.

   * A disk usage spike on =backup.grid.iu.edu= was caused on Saturday by a problem with OSG Software&#39;s backup script:
      * A deduplication script runs as part of the process, linking files from one week&#39;s backup to the previous week&#39;s backup.
        Due to failures at UW, the previous week&#39;s backup did not run, and the script did not find the files to link to.
      * Main.MatyasSelmeci resolved the issue manually, and will update the script to avoid this behavior next time.
        See [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2235][SOFTWARE-2235]].
