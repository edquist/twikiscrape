---++ OSG New PKI Planning Phase Punch List

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZJMyEfdS5Ye7lLyaJxWpr-MV-PpX-LsVRUQRTfSC-A/edit][Command Line Client]]
   * Address comments from Von
   * packaging guidelines/spec
      * Must have RPMs
      * Older OSG 1.2 software are not installing RPMs - using old PACMan install - will phase out by end of the year
      * tarball requested by ESG, plan on doing this as well.
         * Deal with dependencies by including them in a README.

Following are my current punch items for [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit][OIM certificate management design doc]]:

   * How do we synchronize list of FQDNs registered in OIM for each GridAdmins with list of FQDNs that DigiCert allows us to issue certificates?
      * My current understanding is that, when GOC receives a request from someone to become a GridAdmin, GOC will interact with DigiCert manually, then once the request is approved by DigiCert, GOC will update the information in OIM and inform our user that he/she can now approve host certificates. There may or may not be an automated process to make sure OIM and DigiCert are synchronized later.
      * DigiCert exposed the domain list through MPKI: https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php
      * With API can run daily remote to check for mismatches and alert GOC.
   * Can we request DN-override when we send CSR to DigiCert? (Jeremy is currently waiting to hear back from DigiCert on this).
   * Host certificate signing process seems to take very long time on DigiCert (5-10 minutes). This means that we will not be able to provide &quot;bulk host certificate requests script&quot; that works like the DOEGrid version. User will need to request &amp; approve, then wait for a notification that all certificates are signed, the proceed to download the certificates at later time. 
     * Jeremy saw 15-30 s delay during his testing. Soichi says it has changed in the last week.
     * DOE Grids had a one delay
     * One step for bulk requests is a requirement - Tony.
     * Greg has forwarded this on and is waiting for response. Is this delay expected?
   * Needs feedback on auditing - will get that from Acceptance Criteria document.
   * Need to have code review.

         * Goal is not to have all DOE Grids certificates replaced by Operations
         * Goal is to have system tested and accepted.
         * Is there a goal for % of certificates replaced or some other objective metric?

      * Done. This is part of the above Transition plan.

      * 5/14 Revision sent from IU back to DigiCert.
      * Von will present this to OSG ET.
      * Shooting for 6/1 execution if no objections.
