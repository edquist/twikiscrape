Two impacts

  1. Operational stability
  2. Security
The threat:

  1. Attacker obtains credential.
  2. Attack is detected, certificate is revoked and CRL is issued.
  3. RP fails to obtain CRL
    1. By accident
    2. By DOS
  4. Attacker can access RP maliciously until new CRL is obtained.
Key points:

   * CRLs are normally issued on a regular schedule, but can be issued on demand - e.g., when a certificate is revoked.
   * Clients normally download CRLs on a regular schedule, but can download them ad hoc, the challenge is they have no way of knowing when they should - an OOB channel is required.
   * CRL lifetime only comes into play if a client fails to obtain a new CRL as expected, indicating a fault or a DOS attack.

Assume size of CRLs is not an issue. Delta CRLs could help here.

Times:
t(exp) - CRL expiration lifetime (not really expiration - nextUpdate)
t(issue) - normal time between issuance
t(pull) - normal time between RP pulls

t(compromise) - time a cert is compromised
t(discover) - time a cert is discovered compromised
t(revoked) - time a new CRL is issues with revoked certificate
t(rp-revoked) - time a TP pulls new CRL with revoked certificate

Two cases:

  1. RP is allowed to pull new CRL on normal schedule
  2. OOB communication to RP causes RP to pull out of schedule
OCSP:
t(exp) = small window, not quite zero
t(issue) = N/A
t(pull) = on demand

Effect is any unavailability of CA leads to operational issues

t(revoked) = t(rp-revoked)
