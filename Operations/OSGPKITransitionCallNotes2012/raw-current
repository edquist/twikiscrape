---++ Post-2012 Notes

   * OSGPKITransitionCallNotes

---++ 11 Dec 2012

Attending: Von, Mine, Kevin, Anthony, Alain D., Soichi, Chander, Rob, Ruth

Topics:
   * Panda/ATLAS issue (Von)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249
      * https://ggus.eu/tech/ticket_show.php?ticket=87573
     * There is a fix in gridsite CVS. Not sure what the release cycle is, and then when CERN PANDA would pick it up.
      * AI: Rob to follow up on tomorrow&#39;s OPs call.
      * AI: Von to ping John Hoover.
   * ITB Test coverage (Mine?)
      * Oscar&#39;s comment: &quot;When OSG moves to DigiCert Grid CA1 as the new issuing CA for Host certificates there might be an issue in the SAZ and GUMS client plug-ins. It deserves testing before deployment just to be sure we don&#39;t have the problem there too. I need go through your deployment details and I would like to encourage you to run a test with gLExec and a CE deployment against SAZ and GUMS using DigiCert certificates everywhere.&quot;
      * DigiCert was tested with GUMS and glexec
      * Steve Timm: &quot;we did test SAZ with digicert certificates at the same time we tested GUMS in the testing last fall.  But Mine Altunay has also asked us to do a couple new tests with different proxy configurations that we didn&#39;t consider at that time, and that testing is in progress.  We will also test with our own gridsite installation which is part of FermiCloud to see if we see any problems with that.&quot;
   * Plan for stress-test of system (OIM-ITB) with DigiCert on Dec 19?
   * Update on FNAL service desk issues?


Updates:
   * DigiCert has fixed MPKI Domain Manager access issue
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-171
      * Alain and Mine, as registered admins, should be able to access the domain manager in production OSG account.
      * Alain has verified.
      * There is a document on how to do this.
   * DigiCert has implemented two APIs, documentation pending
      * API to access list of registered domains
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-9
      * API for status on multiple certificate requests
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-272

Notes:
   * Panda/ATLAS issue (Von)
      *https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249
      * https://ggus.eu/tech/ticket_show.php?ticket=87573
      * There is a fix in gridsite CVS. Not sure what the release cycle is for making an RPM, and then when CERN PANDA would pick it up.
      * This is now an ATLAS issue.
   * Plan for stress-test of system (OIM-ITB) with DigiCert on Dec 19?
      * Will go ahead, pending scheduling with DIgiCert.
   * Update on FNAL service desk issues (Kevin)
      * A couple success stories without re-load (and using IE).
      * ITB was fixed a couple days ago. Production was fixed today.
      * Only issue: did not see any instructions on installing DigiCert root certificate (for Windows).
         * Soichi: happened automatically for him. Kevin: will try third system today and will let Von know if he sees it again.
      * Ruth: Reports of some people getting certificates from OSG PKI, but FNAL policy says they should be waiting for documentation to be in order. This is an issue between FNAL and its RAs.

AI: Von review hisotry on Grid Admin/domain/VO logic
AI: Von to open JIRAs: (1) Grid Admin request should include VO, (2) Route request to GA based on VO of requestor and GA.

---++ 4 Dec 2012

Attending: Von, Mine, Kevin Hill, Alain D., Rob Q., Soichi, Chander, Christiane F. 

Topics:
   * Panda/ATLAS issue (Von)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249
      * https://ggus.eu/tech/ticket_show.php?ticket=87573
      * There is a fix in gridsite CVS. Not sure what the release cycle is, and then when CERN PANDA would pick it up.
      * AI: Rob to follow up on tomorrow&#39;s OPs call.
      * AI: Von to ping John Hoover.
   * Some host certificate requested being denied: &quot;You are unable to approve this request, as all the domains have not been validated yet.&quot; (Von/Mine)
       * Apparently a configuration problem at DigiCert - domains not validated for &quot;Grid&quot;
       * All domains now validated. Need to test fix.
       * AI: Mine will ask Yujun Wu to re-request certificate. (DONE)
       * We believe this has been resolved. Von has added a note to the Domain page.
   * Seeing strange errors: &quot;null&quot; message in PKCS7 parsing failure (Soichi)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-258
      * Seems to mostly be happening to FusionGrid folks. About half the time. Not clear yet what the issue us. Real diagnosis will need to wait until next week when Soichi is back from Vacation.
      * Please let Von and Soichi know if you see this error.
      * Always starting as guest.
      * Soichi identified likely issue and released patch last week. Haven&#39;t heard anything since then.
      * Christiane did a fair amount of testing and has not seen the issue. Von has not seen any issues in issuance logs.
      * Optimistically calling this resolved.
      * Bug in TomCat 5, but we were using old version. Causes odd failures that weren&#39;t caught by code at expected location, so it resulted in strange error. Will have a much better error message in the future. 

Other business?
   * Kevin: Having issues with a couple people on FNAL service desk with IE only being offered PKCS7 instead of PKCS12.
      * Alain has been working on this: in bringing on Yolanda, ran into a bit of problem, she and someone else were running into a problem with the page &quot;hanging up&quot; then after refresh they only see PKCS7 (w/o private key) and not PKCS12
      * We are aware of one issue with IE. Have a work-around with refreshing the page. Not sure if this is the same issue.
      * Issue is how do they get the private key in PKCS7 file.
      * We think these issues (refesh and lack of PKCS12) are related.
      * What version of IE in use by FNAL? v8.0.17xxx on Windows 7 (v9 is not supported).
      * Folks at FNAL: try renewal at this point.
      * There is already a JIRA about this: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-221
   * Mine: Other problems with FNAL service desk. Are resolved now. Lesson&#39;s learned?
      * Problems with registering Yolanda. Had contact-only account. Couldn&#39;t associate DN. Alain removed existing account? Tried changing email. Then Alain disabled, then she was able to register. We learned how to disable/enable to clear this issue. Is this an issue with contact-only accounts? Those folks when they register will take over that account. Not sure how we got into a bad state here.
      * Once we finished registering and registered as RA, couldn&#39;t see Approve button. Is resolved now... how did this get fixed? This was related. Take-away is we don&#39;t know how we got into bad state. If this happens again we need to debug. Alain now understands how to fix.
   * Christiane: If certificate isn&#39;t issued, what should user do? If user tries to request a new one, they get an error that the email is already in use. Christiane did the &quot;email+something@domain&quot; trick (this is a hack, not something we want to recommend).
      * Revocation didn&#39;t work.
      * We need to debug this. If it happens again, we should try to catch it.
   * Christiane: If they forget the password before issuance, what should they do? They should cancel the request.
      * How about after issuance? They should revoke and re-request.
      * There is a JIRA for a command-line renewal client. Christiane really like this as it avoids users having to put them into their browser. https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-202





---++ 27 Nov 2012

Call canceled due to travel.

---++ 20 Nov 2012

Informal call due to many folks being gone.

Attending: Von, Rohan, Scott, Anthony, Alain, Chander, Christiane, Mine, John Volmer

Updates from Von:
   * Panda/ATLAS issue
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249
      * https://ggus.eu/tech/ticket_show.php?ticket=87573
      * Fix in GridSite CVS, push still uncertain.
   * Some host certificate requested being denied: &quot;You are unable to approve this request, as all the domains have not been validated yet.&quot;
       * Apparently a configuration problem at DigiCert - domains not validated for &quot;Grid&quot;
       * All domains now validated. Need to test fix.
       * AI: Mine will ask Yujun Wu to re-request certificate.
   * Seeing strange errors: &quot;null&quot; message in PKCS7 parsing failure
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-258
      * Seems to mostly be happening to FusionGrid folks. About half the time. Not clear yet what the issue us. Real diagnosis will need to wait until next week when Soichi is back from Vacation.
      * Please let Von and Soichi know if you see this error.
      * Always starting as guest.
   * Documentation now available: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/PKIDocumentationIndex
      * Report any gaps or errors please.
   * DigiCert audit test
      * Von met with DigiCert last week. Laid foundation for test audit. Expect guidance from DigiCert in early December.

Other topics?
   * Host request process (Anthony)
      * Re Yujun requested host certificate for LQCD, at FNAL but Anthony not authoritative (he is CMS). He is seeing host requests for every experiment at FNAL since we email by domain and not VO. 
      * AI: Von: OIM knows VO of requestor and GA, can it only notify GAs for VO in question?
   * Christiane: Users cannot reapply is request fails because email is already in use.
   * When we will request RAs be signing up for VOs?
      * FNAL RAs have not signed up yet. We don&#39;t know why?
      * AI: Von to check with John Benson as to why.
      * People requesting user certs from OSG VO because they don&#39;t know where else to go - their VO was not available. If they can provide with Sponsor, Alain will go ahead and process it. Some can provide and some cannot.
      * Our correct response is: If they can provide a sponsor we will issue them a cert, otherwise their VO is not registered and we cannot serve them and they should go talk to their VO about this.
   * Christiane: User&#39;s need to import into browsers. This will be a problem if they get a new computer.

---++ 13 Nov 2012

Canceled due to SC12 and meeting in Santa Cruz.

---++ 6 Nov 2012

Canceled due to travel.

---++ 30 Oct 2012

Attending: Jim, Von, Ruth, Rob

*Action Items:*
   * AI: Von to capture - need to educate VOs that when they change their VOMS DN (DONE)
   * AI: Alain to update RA processes to capture: We want to encourage Sponsors to have an OIM account, if they don&#39;t the onus is on the RA to capture the sponsor&#39;s contact information.
   * AI: Rob is writing a twiki document on vomses file change: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/VomsesFilewithNewPKI (Want review of VOMS certificate expiring by Tim)

New Action Items:
   * AI: Von to raise Brian&#39;s fix with Maarten, include Rob to raise at WLCG Operations meeting.
   * AI: Jim to open ticket - Identify what in ATLAS workflow is adding certificates to proxies (email GOC)
   * AI: Ruth will open request regarding Panda server for testing.[DONE]
   * AI: Rob to raise this issue with WLG Ops call.
   * AI: Rob to open OIM ticket to add checkbox to registration form that indicates intention to use PKI at present. This removes need for support center and presentation to Ops WG.
   * AI: Von to update https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/OSGCATransition2012

*Agenda:*

Report out on RA and Grid Admin training from prior week
   * Went well. Everyone was able to do everything, no problems with command-line tools. Very few had to use test domain.
   * Next steps on training
      * Von and Ruth will iterate once on list of those missing and Ruth will email, pointing them at recorded.

Current command-line client RPM (1.0.4) OK for next OSG software release?
   * Any issues from GA training on Friday?
   * No, let&#39;s ship 1.0.4 RPM in next software release.

Update on ATLAS/Panda issue:
   * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249
   * We think Brian has a fix for GridSite, has pushed into OSG RPM repository, so it will accept CA certificates in proxy file.
   * We really need this pushed to the Panda server at CERN, John H. is the only one able to update GGUS certificate.
   * OpenSSL has different logic paths if CA certs come from client as opposed to trust root.
   * It seems to be a combination of CA certificates in proxy file and pathlen=0.
   * Next steps?
   * Either push fixes to CERN or try and replicate ourselves. Brian has put up gridsite server and tested his fix.
   * AI: Von to raise Brian&#39;s fix with Martin, include Rob to raise at WLCG Operations meeting.
   * AI: Jim to open ticket - Identify what in ATLAS workflow is adding certificates to proxies (email GOC)
   * AI: Ruth will open request regarding Panda server for testing.
   * AI: Rob to raise this issue with WLG Ops call.

Documentation assignments
   * https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/PKIDocumentationIndex
   * Mainly to Mine, Von, Alain - Von will email them to make sure they are aware.
   * Goal is completion by Nov 9.

Discussion on registration of &quot;PKI-only&quot; VOs and enrollment process
   * Need special case in OIM that are joining to use certificates. PNNL and Argonne just went through current process
   * DayaBay may be a similar case.
   * AI: Rob to open OIM ticket to add checkbox to registration form that indicates intention to use PKI at present. This removes need for support center and presentation to Ops WG.

Discussion about what happens with this call after Feb 1, 2013
   * Continue holding this call, or roll it into existing Monday Operations call.

Other:
   * Jim&#39;s last day with OSG is tomorrow Oct 31.
   * Jim main role has been training, other issue he is involved is the Panda issue.   

---++ 23 Oct 2012

Attending: Jim B., Mine, Chander, Rob Q., Von, John H., Anthony, Soichi, Suchandra

Action Items:
   * AI: Von to capture - need to educate VOs that when they change their VOMS DN. (Captured in Documentation twiki page)
   * AI: Alain to update RA processes to capture: We want to encourage Sponsors to have an OIM account, if they don&#39;t the onus is on the RA to capture the sponsor&#39;s contact information.
   * AI: Rob is writing a twiki document on vomses file change: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/VomsesFilewithNewPKI
   * AI: Jim to see where John H. is on DN transition testing. Can Transition testing be closed out. (DONE - see PANDA issue)
   * AI: Chander to review operations impact document. If he is happy, this is done. (DONE by end of call)

Ongoing tasks:
   * Project Management (Von)
      * New document: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/PKIDocumentationIndex
         * Mine suggests this as top priority.
      * New document: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKITransitionPlan
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * 60-seconds is a ceiling.
      * Can we start implementing a performance tracking?
      * Skipped OIM release this week - next release is Nov 13. (This is SC but I think that is OK.)
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Tim C./Mat S.): https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-758
      * Von is working on plan for 1.1 release and transition to OSG SW team.
   * Training (Mine/Jim): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
      * Report out on 10/22 RA Training - fine, only real issue was Indigo outage. 15 RAs training. No showstoppers. DN mapping to pool accounts for CMS, everyone agreed CMS seems to have a good handle. Couple of FNAL service desk managers had to take it later in the afternoon (Jim gave it twice).
      * Status on GA enrollment? Have 30 people registered. (Alain is out ill.)
      * AI: Jim will provide diff - what RAAs are not trained.

   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony/John)
      * PANDA/ATLAS issue: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249
      * John Hoover - a curl command is failing from ATLAS pilot; but when manually run from a BNL worker node; very strange as we think environment is the same.
      * Problem: executing from pilot, connecting to PANDA server, Apache + mod_gridsite; job dispatch step - pilot asks server for job payload; over https, called from pilot using curl; appears to be failing when run from Pilot using DigiCert proxy in batch mode
      * Seems to work OK with DOE Grids-derived proxy but error seems to occur with DigiCert-derived proxy 
      * This is w/o glexec, pilot is running as John
      * Theory: DigiCert proxy with additional layer of delegation from Condor-G is rejected by gridsite?
      * PANDA does a curl callback? No, always from WN to PANDA @ CERN.
      * Mine: We have a test PANDA server in ITB, why didn&#39;t we see the problem there? John doesn&#39;t think so. There is only one PANDA server in the world.
      * AI: Mine to check with Suchandra on how much ITB tested DigiCert with PANDA. DONE: Suchandra says we was using ATLAS PANDA system, but we didn&#39;t do DigiCert testing.
      * PANDA at CERN presumably uses a CERN CA-issued host certificate.
      * Suchandra: Does not have APS pilot set up. That means no ATLAS pilots were submitted with DigiCert certificate in ITB.
      * ITB doesn&#39;t have a service up and running to test DigiCert certificates with PANDA. 
      * AI: Suchandra will try ....something details of which I missed... to compare DOE Grids PKI and DigiCert.
      * GridSite has a history of sensitivity to parameters in certificate chains.

 

---++ 16 Oct 2012

Ongoing tasks:
   * Project Management (Von)
   * !DigiCert Update (Greg) 
      * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=11351][Open Issues]]
      * Von had call with Greg earlier today, got them moving on Medium item today.

      * Everything scheduled to go in production window last week got in.
      * Fixed a number of DB fixes that were fixed last week.
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Tim C./Mat S.): https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-758
      * RPM still frozen. 
   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony/John)
      * Jim takes an action item to find out where John is out.
   * Operations Impact (Rob): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
      * Chander to review
   * RA Enrollment and Updated RA Processes (Alain D.) - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/NewOSGPKI
      * Addressed concerns from training sessions and JIRA tickets.
      * Added GA process to request additions to domains.
      * Are there outstanding tasks? Nothing major.
      * Expect this to be living document for a while. 
   * Training (Mine/Jim): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
     * GA training was well-attending session, took close to 4 hours.
     * Had issues with confused RPM repo, confusion with right python libraries.
     * Have removed old RPM from test repo so this cannot repeat.
     * Should have participants 
     * Von to review with Soichi timeout issues
     * Need to handle the &#39;catch-all case&#39;
     * Questions about email on tickets.
     * RA training Monday afternoon and GA training Friday afternoon. Von will be around Friday.
   * Contingency Plan - was presented at WLCG Management Board today.
      * No major criticisms or tough questions. Got 3 questions, mainly clarifying.
      * One interesting question - DOE Grids is acting as WLCG catch all CA. Question arose if they is still needed and if so, should this be OSG PKI? Seems like they were leaning towards it not being needed, betters options (National CAs) have emerged, and then there is the CERN CA. This was anyone who didn&#39;t have certificates in WLCG. We think this was mainly for user certificates?
   * Question from Chander: When will renewal notices change to point users to OSG PKI? Von: shooting for mid-December.

   * !DigiCert Update (Greg) 
      * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=11351][Open Issues]]
      * No real updates. Did forward on Von&#39;s question about domain validation.
      * Did move forward with IGTF subscriber agreement.
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * Bunch of minor bug fixes. Freezing OIM-ITB release notes tomorrow. May need to delay by two weeks? Multiple GA per domain seems to me the major issue. Today we&#39;re supposed to finalize the realize note. This is already in ITB.
      * Anthony: FNAL needs this for the training on 8th.
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-172
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Tim C./Mat S.): https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-758
      * Mine: Requesting a certificate creates a ticket in production system.
      * Mine: Adding herself as GridAdmin in OIM-ITB
      * Looking at JSON/SimpleJSON issue.
      * Anthony: Does the GridAdmin scripts open a ticket? Yes, but just for auditing.
      * Mine: What is in the RPM? cert-request, cert-retrieve, and gridadmin scripts.
   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony/John)
   * Operations Impact (Rob): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
      * Fail-over of OIM is 8 minutes if install script doesn&#39;t need to be fixed; took about 20 minutes with fixes. This is onto new VM. Have two racks, plus IUPUI rack (would require couple hour DNS update).
      * Seems like a hot spare wouldn&#39;t buy us much. Need to make sure OIM fail-over scripts are up-to-date.
      * AI: Rob to update Operations Impact with OIM fail-over test results.
      * Hardware has not been purchased.
      * Rob and Chander will discuss offline.
   * RA Enrollment and Updated RA Processes (Alain D.) - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/NewOSGPKI
      * Sponsors not in OIM. Do we allow this?
      * Concept in OIM for contact-only account; RA (any OIM user) can register a non-OIM user; then PKI staff can edit sponsor field to add that person as a Sponsor.
      * Rob: We should have sponsor&#39;s information for audit information.
      * Mine: This also applies to some OSG VOs - not all sponsors have OIM accounts.
      * Non-OIM Sponsors make our life difficult, RAs must capture this.
      * We want to encourage Sponsors to have an OIM account, if they don&#39;t the onus is on the RA to capture the sponsor&#39;s contact information. 
      * AI: Alain to update RA processes to capture: We want to encourage Sponsors to have an OIM account, if they don&#39;t the onus is on the RA to capture the sponsor&#39;s contact information.
      * Do RAs need to the ability to add Sponsors to VO? This is a OIM JIRA issue. Sounds useful.
   * Training (Mine/Jim): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
      * Need client packages by Thursday. Should use current RPM. Only known issue is Soichi&#39;s json issue and we will develop a work-around.
      * Rohan and Von are contacts.
      * AI: Von to make sure he or Rohan is available on Oct 8th for training.

Other business:
   * vomses file update
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-170
      * AI: Rob is writing a twiki document on vomses file change.
      * Technical solutions are difficult without cronjob in local nodes in user space.
      * Multiple lines in vomses file, but when VOMS server DN changes, it&#39;s going to break.
      * Notify community up front with good documentation with fix - wget configuration file or get new VO package. 
      * AI: Von to capture - need to educate VOs that when they change their VOMS DN.
      * This only effects voms-proxy-init users. FNAL users use this.

---++ 25 Sep 2012

Attending: Von, Mine, Alain D., Greg, Jim, Soichi, John V.

Action Items:
   * Rob to check with VOMS developers on whether vomses file supports multiple DNs
   * DONE: Von to update RA enrollment plan with training schedule

New Action Items:
   * Von to create JIRA on &quot;root&quot; RA/GA user in OIM. Is this the PKI staff role? These folks would get every single request.
   * Mine to back up Rob and ping VOMS developers on whether vomses file supports multiple DNs
   * Von to create ticket re: Today, OIM denies the submission of a host cert for a unregistered domain. We tell them to open a ticket for the domain. We did this to catch typos. Do we want to change this behavior?

Ongoing tasks:
   * Project Management (Von)
   * !DigiCert Update (Greg) 
      * Subscriber agreement, bounced between Von and DigiCert.
      * Approval of domains in Domain Manager. JIRA has been submitted. No ETA at this time. Marked has high Priority.
      * Oct 3 is firm for go-line on email addresses not being required to be registered in DigiCert.
      * SubjectAltName has been fixed and pushed live end of last week.
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * Production release today of OIM today. And testing next version of trunk is now on ITB. Domains can now have multiple Grid Admins. We already had multiple domains per Grid Admin.
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Tim C./Mat S.): https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-758
      * RPM available. No one has had a chance to test it yet.
   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony/John)
      * Got updates from John Hover. Hasn&#39;t found any DN transition issues. Found one CERN server not up to date with IGTF distribute and DigiCert certificiates.
   * Operations Impact (Rob): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
   * RA Enrollment and Updated RA Processes (Alain D.) - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/NewOSGPKI
      * All GOC staff have been enrolled as RAs. Staff will be distributed across training sessions.
   * Training (Mine/Jim): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
      * Steve Timm asked to re-schedule one of the training schedules to not conflict with Ops calls (Mondays noon-1pm CT). We could move training to start at 1pm CT? If 3 hours seems sufficient for the first pair of sessions, then we&#39;ll start the second pair (or just RA session) an hour later. Expect we&#39;ll need more time for Grid Admin sessions. We note second Grid Admin session is a Friday so is not a conflict.
      * Had one participant who needed help getting registered with OIM. Would be useful to have directions on Indigo page. Mine will do this, asked Soichi to check what she does.
      * &quot;PKI Staff&quot; vs &quot;PKI Super Staff&quot;: Only Alain gets notification on requests, we can create email lists. For training, trainers need &quot;Super Privileges&quot; for VOs and Domains to fix mistakes, etc. There is not a &quot;root&quot; account today. Trainers should email Soichi with list of VOs/domains they need to be RAs/GAs for training.
     * On Monday, who would be useful to have &quot;on call&quot; in case of problems? Soichi and Alain D.
     * Are we planning on recording on the training sessions? Yes, we are planning on doing this.
     * Working on Soichi to check registrant list. Mine will contact people who are not registered.
     * Jim working on getting existing OSG RA Agents to enroll.
     * When are planning on closing registration? Right now closing on Thursday for Oct 1.
  
Other business:
   * Next Monday is start of transition, when some subset of our community can expect to use the OSG PKI in production. What is needed for that to happen?
      * Need for a user to tell if they can use OSG PKI. Need a list of VOs and domains that are ready.
      * Expectation is folks will request privileges in production system at end of training.
      * Follow up with Agents at the end of training to add them to list.
      * OSG, MIS, OSGEDU are ready today.
   * Grid admin and small sites
      * Today, OIM denies the submission of a host cert for a unregistered domain. We tell them to open a ticket for the domain. We did this to catch typos. Do we want to change this behavior?
   * vomses file distribution plan
      * We need an answer to the question if a vomses file can support multiple DNs. Mine to send email.

Action Items:
   * Rob to check with VOMS developers on whether vomses file supports multiple DNs
   * Soichi to try syncing RSV-SAM portion of ITB, and if that fails will sync all of ITB with production OIM, meaning ITB will lose state.
   * Soichi to try ITB fail-over process and report back to the group (related to Operations Impact)
   * Von to ask Alain to send Training invitation to osg-sites, osg-operations, osg-general, vo-forum, each support center individually, security contacts and osg-vo-admins, plus PKI-transition (Alain to report back to Von which of these lists he cannot send to).

      * Working on a bug fix for overriding SubjectAltName.
      * Oct 3, for domains in email issue (OSGPKI-7).
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * ITB release happened this morning - relatively small list of changes, nothing major wrt PKI.
      * re OIM-ITB: normally sync ITB  with production OIM on every ITB release. Have been postponing. But really need to sync.
      * This seems to create complications with regards to training.
      * Plan B: Try to sync only specific parts (RSV-SAN)
      * Soichi will try plan B, do full sync if this fails.
      * Possible we can postpone Syncs in October, will try.
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Alain R.)
   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony/John)
      * Have not heard from John.

      * Kyle has been enrolled, others in progress. Minor issues.
      * Next is CMS and ATLAS folks - let&#39;s hold off on these folks to align with training schedule. But we should reach out to these folks to encourage. Let&#39;s re-write schedule to align with training.
   * RA Enrollment/Maintainence Process (Von) - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OSGPKITrustedAgent
      * Need to update this with OIM changes.
   * Training (Mine): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan

Other business:
   * Training
      * Training will be on ITB. Jim and Mine will need ability to grant RA authority in ITB. This means they need to be PKI Staff in OIM.
      * Von will arrange for announcement to go out. Will go to: osg-sites, osg-operations, osg-general, vo-forum, each support center individually, security contacts and osg-vo-admins, plus PKI-transition. Jim will send Von DOE Grids PMA list. (Note: Ops cannot send to some of these lists.)
      * Plus follow up with subset of RA agents individually.
      * Need command-line tools by next week, early hopefully. AI: Von will check with Mat S.
      * Need to meet with Alain and Soichi this week.
   * Grid admin and small sites
      * Small sites select their VO RA for host certificates.

---++ 11 Sep 2012

Attending: Chander, Anthony, Jim, Alain D., Rob Q., Soichi, Greg, Rohan

New Action Items:
   * Rob to ping VOMS developers on potential to have multiple DNs per VOMS instance.

Ongoing issues:
   * Project Management (Von)
      * We are now in Deployment Phase. Von has draft Development Phase report, Ruth has reviewed and Von will publish this week.
      * Communications went out to OSG community early this week: http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/doe-grids-service-transition.html
   * !DigiCert Update (Greg)
      * Nothing to report. Still working on email and domain.
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * Sep 11 production release today. Went well. Bugs opened in last couple weeks should have been fixed today. Search went live today, would like people to try.
      * ITB release will be 18th, this must have new features for next production release for 9/25 release. Bugs fixes can be made up until the 25th.
      * Should we make the certificate menu available to the public on the 25th? Should we be changing links to OIM Certificates? Yes and Yes.
      * Alain will get requests without a configured VO. He will be effectively a catch-all RA Agent. Need to be careful about the load here.
      * We can send just new users for OSG VO (2-4 users) per month to OIM.
      * Will leave default links for now, and re-visit this in mid-October when we have more VO RAs on board.
   * Software Acceptance (Alain R./Tim C./Von/Rob Q.)
      * I am rolling this into CLI tools development and packaging
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Alain R.)
      * Targeting upcoming (3.1.9) OSG release for command-line tools. Will have 1.0 version tagged for Mat by end of week.
         * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/UpcomingReleases
   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony)
      * Anthony: tested registering DC in VOMRS with no problems, gave same privs as DOE Grids, was able to approve other certificates. Just touched based with Rob S., encountered no issues with certificates. All CMS sites will be requesting host certificates from OSG/Digicert.
      * What is the workload? A few clicks on VOMS admin end. CMS users may get CERN certificate instead, they are in HR data base so it&#39;s just easy for them, so not expecting much workload.
      * Jim: last exchange with John, had problems with email address domain. Jim will reconnect.
   * Communications (Ruth)
      * Ruth not on call.
      * Dhiva, ESNet, going to reach out to all current PMA members.
      * FNAL has many sub-VOs, service desk acts as RA for these sub-VOs. Mine is talking to the appropriate people.
   * Contingency plan (Mine): http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1115
      * Will be presented to WLCG in October.
   * Operations Impact (Rob): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
      * Pending decision on replication. Going to do a ITB drill on 9/18 on how long it takes to restore. 
   * Updated RA/GA Processes (Alain D.)
      * https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/NewOSGPKI
      * https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/OSGPKIRegisteredDomains
      * Alain will be maintainer of the domain list.
      * Will agents still updates tickets and send email to ra-log, or will they work through OIM action items? Soichi: They can do everything through OIM. Alain: Would like to continue using ra-log until comfortable tickets are being populated.
      * Can we consistently say they are entering &quot;Action Notes&quot; into OIM? Alain: Yes, can re-word.
   * Training (Mine and Jim): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
      * See other business.

Other business:
   * DOE Labs RAs - own relationships with DOE Grids PKI
      * Dhiva will be contacting these folks.
   * When we do the PKI transition the vomses file (http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-package/vomses) will need to updated and distributed with new VOMS DNs as the VOMS admins update their certificates. Without this update voms-proxy-inits could fail causing production issues. (Rob)
      * vomses file distributed to all OSG installations - has address, DN, port # for all VOMS install.
      * voms-proxy-init uses these files. Distributed rarely because VOMS DN don&#39;t typically change.
      * Problem: distribution can take months for everyone to adopt.
      * Should we seek a technical solution? Push file more often?
      * Can we put multiple DNs in for each VOMS to anticipate change? AI: Rob will do this. Not sure if this solves the problem.
      * How many people use voms-proxy-init? FNAL services require it. We don&#39;t know how often it is used beyond that.
      * Rob will bring up at production call.
      * We will take this up next week.
   * Training Plan (Jim and Mine)
      * https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
      * Goals are to bring RAA and GA up to speed on OIM and Policies.
      * Big policy change is how RAA/GA responsibilities are divided.
      * Will also have new agents.
      * Will use ITB instance; that way they don&#39;t have to be fully approved, but in ITB. Will need registration process (with domains). Will go through process of requesting, approving, revoking.
      * GA includes commandline tools as well.
      * Should we cover osg-gridadmin-manage? No.
      * Use Indico for training registration? OIM has no such option.
      * Use AdobeConnect. Anthony: Does this work under Linux? We think it&#39;s Java-based. If AdobeConnect doesn&#39;t work, what will? Webex? (What does InCommon IAM use?)
      * Do we need training for Sponsors? Have we done this before? No
      * How much lead time do we need for registration in OIM-ITB? It&#39;s quick in OIM. Get a week lead time for domain registration.
      * Who will lead and participate in each training session? It would be helpful for Soichi, Alain D. and Von involved. Reasonable for Von and Alain.
   * Decision: Whenever we can, we will encourage people to use the OSG PKI when technically feasible.

DigiCert Update (Greg)
   * All is well with revocation API? Was able to call API, but haven&#39;t confirmed certificate appears in CRL. What is the delay? And the right place?
   * Von sent revised IGTF agreement to DigiCert to eliminate references to Sponsor agreement in Section 6: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-141

Ongoing tasks:
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * Today&#39;s production release(8/28) was postponed until 9/11. This will delay search and some renewal-related bug fixes (we should avoid renewal).
      * User cert revocation can now be tested on OIM-itb (among other recent changes)
         * AI: Alain D. to evaluate revocation interface and give feedback to Soichi

      * Try to map each phase to roughly a week.
      * Should we add an OIM form for opening a ticket to request becoming an TA? If we want to make a workflow out of it, then this is just a first step. Soichi suggest a middle ground as a start to a TA workflow management system - couple days to a week.
      * We should do this.
      * AI: Soichi should open JIRA ticket to track OIM interface to request RA/TA.
      * Will need multiple RAs for VOs (e.g. CMS VO). Allow for multiple secondaries.
      * Soichi will target having ticket opening part available by Sep 11. Will then use Phase 1. 
  * Validation of Subject Alternative Names
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-145
      * DigiCert is taking SubjectAltName from CSR, what vetting should we be doing?
      * What does DOE Grids PKI does? We don&#39;t know. Do we use them?
      * AI: Von to send email to Mike H. and Diva and ask about SubjectAltName policy.
      * Seems like we haven&#39;t using SubjectAltNames in DOE Grids PKI today.
      * User certificate should have RFC 822 for email address.
      * Host certificate should have DNS name and email address.

      * Resolved, yes this will be required unless we hear it is onerous. We expect it will be uncommon.

Ongoing tasks:
   * !DigiCert Update (Greg)
      * Dev team looking at code push for 13 mo validity on production CA. Should have gone to both CAs. Asking us to double check. 
      * AI: Soichi to double check. Jim B. got a 12 mo certificate today.

      * Another release next week; just release itb release - adding interface for searching certificates.
      * oim is working with production CA (12 mo due to other issue).
      * Should discuss certificate renewal process at a future time. What should happen to user/host certificate when renewal is requested? !DigiCert does not revoke old certificate. We should not revoke a renewed certificate. Soichi will send specific questions to the list and Von will add to agenda next week if needed. 
   * Software Acceptance (Alain R./Von/Rob Q.)
      * No major updates.

   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony)
      * Walking through the process of registering DigiCert DN in VOMS and making sure that propagates to sites.
      * John Hover has agreed to go through this process for ATLAS. Anthony is doing for VMS. (Reached out to LIGO, but they are not planning on using DigiCert CA.)

---++ 14 Aug 2012

Attending: Anthony, Soichi, Chander, Rohan, Mine, Alain R., Rob Q.

New Action Items:
   * AI: Von to talk to Suchander about ITB being earlier tester of production certificates.
   * AI: We need to either change this behavior (reported by John Volmer) or provide guidance to user how to deal with this.

Agenda:
   * DigiCert update/issues (Greg)
      * Major issues:
         * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-128][Domains have expired at DigiCert]]
            * Resolved. Scheduling post-mortem on this with Greg and Rob
         * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-111][Certificate lifetime is not 13 months]]
            * Still open. Have pinged Greg for status.
   * Ongoing tasks
      * Update on Web UI (Soichi)
         * Today was release date, when well. Tested user certificate request with OIM and production API. Failed, has sent request to Greg to start troubleshooting process.
      * Software Acceptance (Alain/Von)
         * Had call on Aug 9 with Alain, Rohan, Soichi, Von -  focused on finishing up OIM and turning to command-line clients.
         * Went well, OIM needs documentation, otherwise looks good.
         * CLI identified needed documentaiton. Planning for more formal hand-off to software team.
      * Update on CLI tool packaging (Alain R./Rohan)
         * Rohan has ball to merge in to trunk.
      * Update on Python 2.4/2.6 testing (Von/Rohan): https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-41
         * Have access to FermiCloud.
         * osg-cert-request seems good on 2.4.
         * Hit an issue with osg-cert-retrieve: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-126 
         * osg-gridadmin-cert-request pending.
      * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony)
         * Anthony has been out the last week.
      * Communications (Ruth)
         * On vacation.
      * ITB testing - should we repeat the ITB testing from the planning phase?
         * Should ITB be a early adopter of the OSG PKI?
         * In planning phase we worked with Suchander - he seems to be point.
         * AI: Von to talk to Suchander about ITB being earlier tester of production certificates.
      * Update on Contingency analysis and plan (Mine): http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1115
         * Sent to ET last Friday, have heard no feedback yet.
         * Chander has read - 2 Qs: Do you know of any other major team that has put a contingency plan for a PKI in place? How much resortation can we accomplish by restoring a fraction of the users certificates - is that a reasonable strategy? Fill follow up with Mine on Thursday.
         * Mine contacted CERN CA (back in June) - they don&#39;t have a contingency plan, as they think they have enough redundancy place to recovery quickly (in 1-2 weeks). FNAL KCA has similar thoughts.
      * Operations Impact (Rob): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
         * Added information requested by Ruth - added estimated FTE. Is available.

      * Training (Mine): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
         * This is activity ramping up now contingency plan is done drafting.
   * Other business?
      * John Volmer: Requesting multiple personal certificates onto desktop. Interface seems require a unique email address for each certificate request.
         * Approaching OIM anonymous, always requires unique email address. So one is required to authenticate with cert in browser to obtain multiple certificates?
         * Is this what we want? This is not the way things have worked before.
         * Users may not load certificates into browsers otherwise.
         * What should a user do if they run into this?
         * AI: We need to either change this behavior or provide guidance to user how to deal with this.
         * E.g., user requesting certificate before certificates expired.
         * We are expecting users to authenticate with certificate in browser if they have it.

---++ 31 July 2012

Attending: Tony, Chander, Greg, Alan D., Von, Mine, Rohan, Alain R.

Agenda:
   * Command-line tool updates (Rohan)
      * Tony confused by purpose of command-line tools. Expecting ability to request a single hostname without separate approval step. Found names confusing, suggests dropping &#39;multi&#39;
      * Asked about how to issue service certificates - should be able to specify &lt;svc&gt;/&lt;fqdn&gt;, but it seems to be broken at the moment: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-93
   * Action Item round up:
      * Von to send out email to next rounds of testers.
         * DONE
      * Von to review https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
         * PENDING
   * Greg update on Roadmap - August 22nd at latest, client revocation code will be live.
      * Can we get documentation head of time? Yes, Greg.
   * Contingency Analysis (Mine)
   * Deadline for revocation API (Soichi not on call, discussion off-line)
   * What is motivation for python 2.4 support? RHEL5 which common, also Scientific Linux 5
      * Rohan and Von both using macs which doesn&#39;t play well with Python 2.4 - can we get access to a RHEL5 machine
      * FermiCloud is one option, or Alain has some old hosts, or use a VM. FermiCloud would allow direct testing of RPMs. Alain would supply link for Fermi account, then talk to Steve T.
   * Packing of CLI tools
      * Goals: RPMs - RHEL5 &amp; variants, RHEL6 &amp; varients, Scientific Linux is the most common variant. OSG SW3 is all RPM-based.
      * What else do we want to support? Older release is OSG 1.2. That version is not RPM - it is all PacMan. Have told people we are not doing updates, ship updates rarely. Do we want to provide a 1.2 release as well? For PacMan need a usable tarball - what is a usable tarball? M2Crypto is already an RPM, but is extra effort for PacMan.
      * Would need tarball for CLI clients, and then tarball for M2Crypto. Also SWIG is needed.
      * Nothing we described doesn&#39;t sound like something Alain
      * Can we decide not do do 1.2 packaging? Anthony says CMS would be fine without 1.2 packages.
      * There may also be other machines  - non-RPM, non-PacMan. Could just point them at source repository? RPM gets us 90%.
      * There is also always the Web Interface, between it and the source repo, it seems to be covered.
      * DECISION: We will be doing RPM only until someone complaints.
      * Two possible issues for packaging - configuration file shared and one python file imported by all scripts. Both are static. Configuration file should be looked for in standard places and same with python files.
      * We do not need to patch m2crypto any more.
      * Alain will drive packaging.
      * ACTION ITEM: Would like &#39;make dist&#39; that creates versioned tarball.
      * Does RPM contain both new and DOE Grids scripts? Yes is the decision.
      * ACTION ITEM: We should settle names before packaging.
      * ACTION ITEM: Script should look in /etc/ and ./ for configuration file (maybe /etc/osg/)
      * What should script find module? we will use PYTHONPATH

      * Status update with Soichi, in next sprint.
      * Gathering information
      * Will use cert revocation be included? Greg will double check.
   * Status of Web UI (Soichi)
      * Going well, Alex S. helping test, small changes. Getting close to releasing OIM with production version of certificate interface with hidden menu, but able to issue real certificates. Will be able to serve production CLI.
   * Status of command line UI (Von/Rohan)
     * Major block was API for multi-cert script. Have minor things left. Bulk cert request ready soon.
     * How close are we to packaging these? Let us try to start this after next week&#39;s call.
   * DN Change testing (Jim/Anthony)
      * Anthony got a certificate yesterday, didn&#39;t have O=OSG, waiting to hear timeline before deciding to proceed or wait. Would like to have final DN before proceeding.
      * Could we start issuing real certificates to friendly users in August? Von doesn&#39;t see why not, as long as RA load isn&#39;t too high. Soichi: should set up proper RA structure when we do this.

         * Von has proposal for MPKI interface. Mine: Can security team have back up? Yes, all can have delegations.
      * Contingency Plan (Mine)
         * Goal of document is &quot;how does OSG survive 3 months until a permanent replacement CA is set up?&quot;
         * Looking at options for restoring all certificates versus a subset of certificates; IGTF and non-IGTF options; meeting with external CAs (NCSA and NERSC) who could support us during a contingency period - both would involve us creating accounts for OSG users manually and then they could get short-lived certificates from their respective MyProxy CAs.

---++ 23 July 2012 (SW acceptance call)

Attending: Alain, Soichi, Von

Action Items resulting:
   * Soichi: For Section 2, item 5: Finish documentation such that a second developer could maintain OIM
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-70
   * Von: For Section 2, item 7: If possible,  investigate automated webapp security tests for OIM.
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-71
   * Soichi: Soichi will send Von URL and screen shots of logs for approval (4.2)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-72
   * Soichi: We should check DNs and lifetimes, and alert GOC staff if we see something unexpected (but not error out) (4.4 and 4.5)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-73
   * Von: Is there off-site (non-Bton data center) backup? (5.1.1)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-74
   * Von: Do we need to limit Trusted Agents to use of DigiCert certificates? (6.2)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-75
   * Von: Under the old system, reach TA/GA had to renew their rights each year with certificate renewal. Was this purposeful? (no specific section)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-76
   * Von: Define process by which someone becomes a RA/GA (7)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-77

      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-79 (9)
   *  Soichi: Private key deletion should be implicitly or explicitly logged? Can we overwrite private key with noise? Or are we at mercy of GC?
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-80

Notes:
   * Working through this https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-PKI-Acceptance-Criteria-2.docx
   * Just focusing OIM, will do with client tools later
   * Section 2, MUSTS:
      1 All GOC software is Apache v2
         * Should make sure this is stated somewhere in the source code.
         * Goal here is that OSG has access to software if IU leaves consortium
      2 Version scheme: protocol has a version
      3 Test suite: Have a few unit tests, not comprehensive. Access control requirements makes testing hard. Most testing is &#39;friendly user&#39; testing.
         * Have a testing period on ITB is acceptable.
      4 End-user documentation: in the case of OIM this is the web pages itself
      5 Internal developer documentation:
         * This is a bigger concern, how would a second developer come up to speed? How is it build and deployed?
         * Alex D. has been added to OIM development
         * We have: https://docs.google.com/a/vonwelch.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit#
         * Result: some work need to be done here to document built processes.
      6 Source code repository with versioning scheme: use subversion, branch every release
      7 External code review:
         * This is more applicable to CLI, since SW team will be taking this over.
         * We don&#39;t have expertise to do this for OIM (javascript, other web technologies) on OSG SW team.
         * Should we do webapp testing for OIM? We should at least do low-hanging fruit. OWASP.
         * MIST is an option, but would need to be resourced.
         * What about GUMS, VOMRS developers? Doesn&#39;t seem likely they have spare cycles.
         * Alain is fine with state of affairs here for OIM.
      * With exception of completing documentation for item 5, Alain is happy with section 2.
   * Section 2, SHOULDS:
      1 Use community software: Not applicable.
      2 Widely-known technologies: Acceptable
      3 See 5 above.
      4 See 7 above.
   * Section 3:
      * These items are pending, have ITB testing coming up.
   *  Section 4:
      * 4.1: Approval: DONE
      * 4.2: Auditing: This is all in OIM logs, via OIM-log interface. 
         * AI: Soichi will send Von URL and screen shots of logs for approval.
      * 4.3: General format: DigiCert is generating certificates.
      * 4.4: DN form: DigiCert is responsible for forming the DN
         * AI: We should check DNs and alert GOC staff if we see something unexpected (but not error out).
      * 4.5: Certificate Lifetime: DigiCert sets this
         * AI: Augment above AI, we should check lifetime
   * Section 5:
      * 5.1.1: Integrity of Auditing: All OIM DB content is backed up to back up server, daily snaps shots for 60 days, backup server is backed up to tape.
         * AI: Is there off-site (non-Bton data center) backup?
      * 5.1.2: Protection from modification: is protected by usual mysql access controls and unix file system permissions. Access limited to GOC staff and limited by bastion host. Back ups provide extra protection.
      * 5.1.3: Any changes to auditing will be logged: no applicable, all database changes are logged.
      * 5.1.4: Any attempt to modify logs will be logged:  all database changes are logged.
      * 5.1.5: Time sycnhronizing: Run NTP, and monitor against 2nd second system to sanity check.
      * 5.2.1: Unexpected errors will be logged: Yes, are are forward to GOC service alert.
      * 5.2.2: Any violation of policy: We don&#39;t allow violations of policy, see PKI System Design Doc.
   * Section 6: Authentication
      * 6.1: Failed authentication attempts will be logged: We do certificate-based authentication, handled by Apache. Apache logs failures. We don&#39;t currently monitor.
      * 6.2: Trusted Agents shall be authenticated with valid DigiCert certificate: TA must authenticate. We currently accept any IGTF certificate for OIM. We don&#39;t currently enforce the use of a specific CA for TA.
         * TA role is bound to contact Id, one can map multiple certificates contact ID. We could implement TA as an authorization and force binding to a DN.
         * AI: Do we need to limit Trusted Agents to use of DigiCert certificates?
         * AI: Under the old system, reach TA/GA had to renew their rights each year with certificate renewal. Was this purposeful?
   * Section 7:
      * We don&#39;t currently have a defined process for this for the OSG CA. Should define a process where all of this is logged as a ticket, which becomes the audit record.
      * AI: Define this process.
   * Section 8:
      * 8.1.1: We have 3 limits - global for the entire OSG for year, user has an annual limit (3 user certificates, 1000 host certificates) , user has a daily limit for host certificates (50); these are administratively adjustable.
      * 8.1.2: Track and notify when certain levels are reached:
         * Have Munin plug-in to monitor number of requests: https://internal.grid.iu.edu/munin/ITB_VMs/oim-itb/cert_quota.html URL here.
         * 75% of threshold, 85% is critical and sends warnings on these levels.
         * Multiple thresholds are problematic.
         * AI: Change warning to 50%, critical to 75%.
      * 8.1.3: No longer a requirement. See https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-69
      * 8.1.4: See 8.1.1
      * 8.1.5: See 8.1.1
      * 8.2.1: Host Certificate Approvers of host certificates shall be Grid Admins: Implemented
      * 8.2.2: GA shall be restricted to a domain: Confirmed
      * 8.3.1: User email addresses must be in DigiCert.
         * AI: Need to add checking of user&#39;s email domain.
      * 9.1: Private key generation logging: Von will verify this when he verifies logging for item 5.
         * This is not explicit, private key is created when certificate generated, and when session expires.
         * Want to be able to answer question: what keys were on the system during a given time frame?
         * Private key deletion is tied to session expiration - is this logged? Not currently, but can be turned on.
         * AI: Private key deletion should be implicitly or explicitly logged? Can we overwrite private key with noise? Or are we at mercy of GC?
      * 9.2: Private keys encrypted with strength-tested pass phrase: Done.
      * Section 10: Host certificate revocation works today, user certificate revocation is pending support from DigiCert.
      * Section 11: Training and Testing:
         * We have this with OIM ITB.

New Action Items:
   * Jim to talk to Anthony re DN change testing
   * Von to check out new registration process from Soichi
   * Soichi create document with bulk host use case, what he is doing today, and what is.

Agenda/notes:
   * Introduction of Rohan Mathure who is coming on board at IU to take over for Jeremy.
   * Quick update from Von on Interactions Document.
   * Quick update from Jim on VO Transition
      * AI: Jim will follow up with Tony offline.
   * Quick update from Mine on contingency plans
      * Von and Mine met this morning, covering compromise or loss of OSG PKI.
   * Greg on any updates from DigiCert
      * Waiting on results from bulk-host testing. Requests have been put into dev-team.
      * We can get peek at their roadmap when it is sorted out.
   * Update from Jeremy on command-line scripts.
      * Sent out invitation to list to test CLI scripts. They are not packaged currently. Just check it out of subversion. There is a README and each script has &#39;-h&#39; option.
      * Packaging might be a day&#39;s work, Rohan will contact Alain when ready.
      * Please send issues to list or start a JIRA issue.
   * Update from Soichi on front-end and testing, bulk-host certificate request.
      * Updated registration process email - turning into a complicated process - dealing with a lot of corner cases (e.g. expired certificate, so unauthenticated, but has DN)
      * AI: Von to look at updated chart.
      * Have something slow for bulk-host, expect to improve it with better API.
      * Digicert doesn&#39;t have a clean way to get status on a requested certificate. We wait for 60 seconds, then every 5 seconds ask for a host certificate.
      * AI: Soichi create document with use case, what he is doing today, and what is.
      * Will be gone next week.
   * Discussion of duplicate host certificate issuance (email exchange with Anthony)
      * Von describes his proposal that host certificates have to be expiring or revoked to be reissued.
      * Anthony needs a grace period for changing over expired certificates. One month sounds reasonable. T1 is very concerned about downtime because they are contractually obligated.
      * Jim &amp; Mine: concerned about disaster planning - need to encourage some overlap of certificates.
      * Soichi: Already have three limits (day, user, total) - do we need another limit?
      * Alain: Should we handle these a exceptions rather than policy.
      * Von agrees not to bake this into policy.
   * Other business?

---++ 12 June 2012

Agenda:
   * Action items
   * Tasks on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase

Action Items:
   * Soichi to send out email when OIM-ITB ready for testing
      * Done: https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificate
   * Jeremy to send out email when CLI tools ready for testing
      * Pending on issue regarding delays in host certificate issuance

New Action Items:
   * Sort out renewal (???)

Notes:
   * Host certificate signing delays - Greg - had some configuration issues, has been fixed to threshold of a minute. Also discovered that our setting for batch certificates is hitting them every 5 seconds, which is putting a strain on their servers. Can we make requests about a particular certificate every ~30 seconds.
      * We need get Soichi to make changes on our side and then Jeremy. 
      * Soichi: We send up 50 cert requests, then start pinging. We are talking here the querying about certificates once requested.
      * Can we have a API call to request all the status at once?
      * What is the paradigm that DC would like it to use?
      * Can we wait 60 second before we make the first request? Then they should all be issued.
      * Is this a server dedicated to OSG? No. What will be the impact of other customers on our requests?
   * No other updates on other items, first one consumed all the time.
   * OIM-ITB is available for testing, Alex Sim has been testing and Soichi has been fixing a bunch of issues that he released just before the call.
      * Any unresolved complaints at this point? Certificate renewal is unclear.
   * Jim has looked at Transition testing, will be blocked until a production OIM certificate front end is available.
   * Draft Planning phase report is available: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-Planning-Phase-Report-3.pdf

---++ 5 June 2012

Agenda:
   * Action items
   * Tasks on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase

Action Items:
   * Von to develop what it means for development to be complete and deployment to begin given our &quot;devops&quot; approach.
      * Done, on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase
   * Rob to complete Op Changes document.
      * In progress, Action Item changed to task on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase
   *  Soichi to consider implications of possible delay in host certificate issuance and implications to design.
      * Added new API call &quot;issue()&quot;  - should be called until it returns success.
      * For Web UI, requestor precess &quot;Issue&quot; which then waits certificate issuance and then user can &quot;download.&quot;
      * Could we just make request when GA approves and then notify user when it is ready to retrieve?
      * Von: OK to try this, but let&#39;s keep an eye on how this works in practice.
      * DONE.
   * Jeremy to send email to Greg on user certificate revocation to sort on confusion on API support for this.
      * PENDING: Jeremy just sent script, script was mean for host certificates, but also works for users, Greg is looking into it.
   * Soichi to send out email when OIM-ITB ready for testing
      * The interface is ready, haven&#39;t sent out the email - will sent accounts for them - what roles do they want - renewal and revocation not done.
      * Von and Soichi to work on this off list.
   * Jeremy to send out email when CLI tools ready for testing
      * All the individual action scripts are done, bulk done shortly.

Notes:
   * John Volmer - what does the RA interface look like - best to ask Soichi to test as RA.

---++ 29 May 2012

Agenda:
   * Action Item check in
   * Summary of last week&#39;s discussion on iterative development plan.
   * Updates from Jeremey and Soichi on development activities.
   * Training plan for end users? Questions from email thread with Mine.
   * Other business.

New Action Items:
   *  Soichi to consider implications of possible delay in host certificate issuance and implications to design.
   * Jeremy to send email to Greg on user certificate revocation to sort on confusion on API support for this.
   * Soichi to send out email when OIM-ITB ready for testing
   * Jeremy to send out email when CLI tools ready for testing

Closed Action Items:
  * Von to ask Alain D. if he would be willing to serve as RA/GA during development testing.
      * Done all call... Alain agrees.
      * Level of formalism for testing - go ahead and do production like vetting.
   * Chander to add action item to do test Audits with DigiCert in early Transition Phase.
      * DONE - item #36 https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OSGPKIProjectWBS
   * Mine to finish training document
      * Use OIM-ITB for triaining
      * Add reference to 5.3.3 of the OSG/DigiCert RPS
      * DONE

Notes:
   * Greg on DigiCerts issues:
      * Latency issues - normally only 1-2 minutes - anything above that is a technical glitch or trigger of a risk score, e.g. &quot;microsoft.iu.edu&quot;, manual approval - human time 5-15 minute approval. Let him know if we see further issues.
         * Will need to redesign workflow for host certificate requests - need to request from DigiCert ahead of user request to retrieve for OSG.
         * AI: Soichi to think about.
     * Revocation for user certificates - API doesn&#39;t support client cert through API? Jeremy says it worked. We&#39;re confused here.
         * AI: Jeremy to send what he thinks does this to Greg to close the loop.
   * Alain: Would it help to start packaging things as RPM quickly?
      * Would be good to do sometime in June before Jeremy takes off. Jeremy will touch base with Alain when ready.
   *  Soichi update:
      * Wrapping up prototype for testing by others. Most of design doc items prototyped. Expect email middle of this week pointing folks to OIM-ITB with list of features that are expected to work.
   * Jeremy update:
     * Generating requests with user-ready code in Subversion in sandbox. Hope to have the rest of it up and running in the next couple of days. Will send out email later this week when it&#39;s ready for more eyes.
   * Von: Contract with DigiCert agreed to by all, expect execution this week.

---++ 22 May 2012

Agenda:
   * Focused development discussion

Notes:
   * Soichi has prototype already at OIM-ITB
   * We will plan on doing a iterative testing model with OIM-ITB and code that is available frequently to members of OSG-PKI email list (and others who are interested).
   * What is the relationship between software team and new PKI software?
      * OIM is not packaged or distributed - is available under Apache license from IU SVN - not public, but that&#39;s historical not by policy
      * There is precent for other services like this in OSG - e.g. RSL
      * General decision regarding OIM is that it stays where it is at, but SW Team has a role in ensuring it&#39;s quality.
      * Client tools are more clear - will be owned by SW team and replace DOE Grids tools in VDT.
         * There is an issue here of long-term support to work out.
   * During testing we will be using DigiCert Pilot CA, don&#39;t need to use full set of policies - do need someone to act as RA/GA - Von will as Alain D. to do so.
      * At some point we need to shift to full policies - at Deployment?
   * Soichi and Jeremy will announce on OSG-PKI list where software/services are available for testining.
      * Software for testing may be very raw - e.g. not have packaging for client software, testers expected to do &#39;svn co&#39;
      * Soichi and Jeremy should make it clear what is expected to work.
      * Feedback may not be addressed immediately depending on prioritization - developing other features may be first.
   * Next major milestone is July 20th, Acceptance testining
      * Expectation is software is functionally complete per Acceptance Plan
      * May not have all the polish and user friendliness at that point
      * We will arrange meeting with Von, Alain R. and developers to review software per plan

New Action Items:
   * Von to ask Alain D. if he would be willing to serve as RA/GA during development testing.
   * Von to develop what it means for development to be complete and deployment to begin given our &quot;devops&quot; approach.

Notes:
   * Project Planning
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OSGPKIProjectWBS
      * Folks should go look at plan and review ownership items and let Chander know of any problems.
   * New version of RA/GA DigiCert agreement - folks should review for show stoppers.
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertAgreements/DigiCert-OSG_Agent_Agreement_-_May_7_2012.docx

      * Comments from Jim to be addressed in document:
         * Goal is not to have all DOE Grids certificates replaced by Operations
         * Goal is to have system tested and accepted.
         * Is there a goal for % of certificates replaced or some other objective metric?

   * Jim to write up DN Migration Plan with manual authorization at VOMS
      * DONE; this document may be done - could dig more into implementation details and survey VOs on practices.

Agenda:
   * Review use cases: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit
      * Why not register user in OIM as soon we get the user&#39;s contact information? Do we need to make sure the user gets their certificate first?
      * Renewal - don&#39;t revoke old certificate on renewal.
      * Renewal - should just re-key; getting new certificate into browser is part of it. Requires new use case for user-supplied CSR.
      * New ticket for each renewal instead of opening new ticket? Some VOs are interested in renewals.
      * Tag tickets differently for requests and renewals for each searching.

---++ 17 April 2012

Decisions:
   * Carry the 50 cert/day limit forward for bulk certificate requests.
   * We will do manual re-authorization at VOMS (no automated population of new DNs)

Action Items:
   * Von to take first pass at assigning personnel to Project Plan
   * Jim to write up DN Migration Plan with manual authorization at VOMS
   * Von to ping Keith C. as we haven&#39;t heard from him re Contingency Plan in a couple of weeks.
   * Von to write up policy and reasons on in-server key generation.
   * Von to review RA Training Plan

Agenda:
   * Report on action items:
      * Von and Chander to group tasks to match project plan (pending Von)
         * Tasks now grouped into the following to match Chander&#39;s plan: Deployment and Development Plan, Training Plan, Communications Plan, Transition Plan, Contingency Plan, DigiCert Agreements
         * Next step: We need to assign a primary owner for each task and then work with that owner to get intervals for each task.
      * Jim and Von to talk to WLCG VOMS admins to determine policies on pre-loading (in progress)
      * Von to ping Keith C. as we haven&#39;t heard from him re Contingency Plan in a couple of weeks.
      * Von, Jeremy and Soichi to address use case of  Grid Admin making authenticated CLI host request.

         * Good Use Cases and Feature Matrix
         * Von went through and commented on, topics to discuss:
            * Sponsors
               * Alain D: VO-manager will provide list of Sponsors for VO, most of the time. Sponsors not formally agreeing to something. They preferably have a DOE Grids Cert. An non-user can act as a sponsor, if need be.   
               * Sponsors do not have authority to issue certificates. 
            * Un-checked Grid Admin requests - concerns Von re typo on CLI app
               * Tony: GA must create a file with N hostnames.
               *  Alain R: Has made a mistake with N wrong hostnames.
               * Tony: This is part of what the 50 cert/day limit enforced - would spread requests out over multiple days. 
               * Decision: Carry the 50 cert/day limit forward.
         * Notes:
            * In-browser vs In-server key generation.
            * Jim: has had an extensive discussion with TAGPMA in CILogon, they were OK with it, so far users seem to like it. No bad experiences so far.
            * In-browser was number 1 complaint at March&#39;12 AHM.
            * *Action Item*: Von to write up a page on this. Need to consider sustainability to make sure future maintenance doesn&#39;t break things.
      * [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZJMyEfdS5Ye7lLyaJxWpr-MV-PpX-LsVRUQRTfSC-A/edit][PKI Project Architecture Outline]]

   * DN change plans (Jim B.)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/DOEGrids2DigiCertDNTransition
      * Users must sign AUP in VOMRS every year, so pre-populating won&#39;t save users from visiting VOMRS; will save VOMS admin from approving new DN.
      * Anthony: pre-populating doesn&#39;t buy him anything.
      * Pre-population not a clear win over manual approval, especially given re-vetting is required.
      * Any VOs besides ATLAS and CMS we need to consider? GLOW has 12-20 users, would be more work, Engage has 70 users.
      * Housecleaning is benefit of manually.
      * Decision: We will do manual revetting at VOMS.
      * *Action Item*: Jim will write up pan for manual method (add DN to existing VOMS account).
      * Still see much value in GUMS supporting multiple users - expect both DNs to be in system for jobs in flight, and data access (CMS T1 do DN-&gt;userid mapping).
   * Report on OSG Certificate needs (Von)
      * Based on analysis of queries to http://pki1.doegrids.org/ca/srchCert.html
      * 3,800 People certificate and 11,500 Host certificates (up from 2,500 and 6,000)
      * Seems to be increasing 10% per year
      * About 10-20% of certificates seem to be duplicate by DN - assuming re-issuances.

Agenda:
   * Report on action items:
      * Jim and Von to talk to WLCG VOMS admins to determine policies on pre-loading.
         * Conversation initiated.
      * Von and Chander to group tasks to match project plan
   * First stab at training plans: https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan (Mine)
   * Design discussion report out (Von)
      * Soichi, Jeremy, Von
      * Users may legitimately have multiple certificates(?) - impacts duplicate detection.
        * Rob Q. confirms - users in multiple VOs.
      * Change: RA agents will not be able to approve Host/Svc certificates
         * Alex: Not going to be easy to have representatives from each domain, allow for delegation from authority.
      * Client-side authn for host scripts? No - Do we want CLI for anything besides host certificates - No.
         * Scripts currently ask for a personal certificate before generating CSR
         * cert-grid-admin - from OSG distribution, does authentication
         * then is another set of scripts that doesn&#39;t do authentication - cert-request.
         * Jeremy&#39;s script is called - will report.
         * Site admin may submit requests - and then Grid Admin must approve
         * Most of the time Site Admins are also Grid Admins, in that case an authenticated request from a Grid Admin does not need subsequent approval.
      * Matrix of supported features
         * This is in the system design doc: OIM Certificate Management System Design
      * Every request has to be approved by an RA Agent or Grid Admin
         * And not automated.
     * If we&#39;re going to have a CLI to generate a CSR, why not just have it do submission, why bring a web browser into it at all?
     * What are the packaging assumptions on what users have installed?
        * Table this for when Alain R.
   * New versions of architecture documents (Jeremy/Soichi)

         * Current host certificate quota per day is 50/day
            * Tier One - glexec could require more host certificates - not in the near future.
         * OIM will have regex
   * Contingency plans (Keith C.)
      * Keith not on call.
      * Is this a separate task now under the security team? No.

---++ 3 April 2012

AI: Jim and Von to talk to WLCG VOMS admins to determine policies on pre-loading.

AI: Von and Chander to group tasks to match project plan
   * Spend a few minutes on the technical plan - figure out what is high priority (needed by other parts)
   * Can we knock of the REST API design, as that seems simpler.

Agenda:
   * Contingency plans (Keith C.)
      * Latest draft on March 14th, Von comments on March 28th
   * DN change plans (Jim B.)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/DOEGrids2DigiCertDNTransition
      * Von asks: I suspect we&#39;ll be in a world with inconsistent GUMS deployment, can we handle that?
      * Alain: OSG 1.0 hasn&#39;t been supported in over a year and there are still a handful of sites running this.
      * It takes a long time to get everyone to upgrade.
      * Suspects a lot of sites will be willing to upgrade, still it will take months. LHC sites in production will be reluctant. Will need to think about how to make it as easy as possible.
      * Not sure there has been a non-security issue where software was pushed hard.
      * Believe we&#39;ve done that with Gratia?
      * Will using the old GUMS with multiple DNs break things? We don&#39;t know. This will probably cause problems.
      * Can we have multiple VOMS accounts? One per DN
      * They are not equivalent.
      * Downside to &quot;manual changeover&quot; - GUMS queries VOMS 4x/day - so there is a lag
      * Tony: if you talk to CMS and ATLAS, they use VOMS in WLCG; not a big issue for CMS, they can update GUMS responsively.
      * Unit of transition is individual.
      * Having jobs in flight using proxies requires multiple DNs in VOMs.
      * Tony: suspect we need a 1-2 month window to get sites to upgrade. We think this is relatively easy for the 80% of LHC.
      * Option (A): everyone updates GUMS, add new DNs to existing VOMS accounts, nice and smooth
      * Option (B): add new VOMS accounts with new DNs in advance, existing account mappings could be broken - would need to explore specific account mappings
      * Option (C): once user gets their DigiCert certificate, they need to go to VOMS-Admin, VOMRS and register their new DN. May also require manual operation by VOMS administration, will require approval (Tony: yes, it will require approval).
      * Tony: Don&#39;t know we can get WLCG to pre-populate pre-existing DNs
      * Have VOs pick the option they desire? Can this be per-VOs choice?
      * Who is WLCG POC? Marty Pena (Tony will send me contact information) for CMS VOMS server.
      * Could put a temporary OSG VOMS server?
   * DigiCert contracts and agreements (Von)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/DigiCertAgreements
      * Von has reviewed, call with DigiCert postponed until tomorrow (Apr 4)
      * Question about Sponsor registration - required?
      * Can we make the RA agreements less legalese
      * Master Agreement looks OK
      * RPS needs some tweaks to remove old cyrptographic module language
      * Does it require collection of PII to add Agent? FNAL has a problem with that.

Attending: Jeremy, Von, Jim, Alex, Chander, Alain D., Anthony, 

Action items:
   * Von to review latest version of Keith&#39;s contingency plan
   * Jeremy to post initial version of design document to email list later this week.
   * Von and Soichi to review Jeremy&#39;s document and comment

Agenda:
      * Contingency plans (Keith C.)
         * New version sent out March 14 - anyone had a chance to reivew?
         * AI: Von to review
      * DigiCert RAA vetting process (Jim B.)
         * Standards DigiCert process - Scott checked Jim&#39;s photo ID and then Jim digitially signed agreement. Then Jim was able to do Von and Mine.
         * How will this relate to our DigiCert?
         * Would prefer signed email and shorter agreement.
      * DN change plans (Jim B.)
         * Take advantage of new feature in GUMS where we can associate multiple DNs with users
         * If we can predict DigiCert DNs, then we can load those into GUMS ahead of time
         * Puts a strong dependency for us on new GUMS work - John Hoover is spreadheading this.
         * AI: Jim to ping John (and Alain R.) let them know about our dependency, ask for updates, and ask for current timeline.
      * DigiCert contracts and agreements (Von)
         * New versions of all agreements received from DigiCert, haven&#39;t had a chance to review: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/DigiCertAgreements
         * Goal is to turn them around these around in the next week.
         * DigiCert Grid CA is now issuing 30-day CRLs
      * New JIRA Issue: We handle click-through or delegate to DigiCert? (Von)
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-5
         * In general seems like we should just undertake doing these things.
      * Design updates (Jeremy)
         * High-level design - initial version by 3/23, final version by 3/30: This is a short 2-3 document giving the high-level components of the front end, and also discussing any other components we will be producing (e.g., a new bulk host request script). The major thing this document will do is lay out the big decisions in terms of what software we&#39;ll leverage, e.g., OIM, or what is undecided, e.g. we&#39;ll need some library here to do REST calls. The initial version gets circulate for comment and then finalized by 3/30.
         * Components designs - initial versions by 4/17, finalized by 5/1. For each component, a ~4 page document describing what it will do, what it&#39;s requirements are, what it will interact with, and how we&#39;ll go about about developing it. Initial versions by 4/17 gives two weeks for comments and discussions and finalized by the 5/1 end of the planning phase. My expectation is we&#39;d follow a MVC approach, so would have documents for the GUI, the database, and the controller logic (which would perhaps include interacting with DC or perhaps that would be another component), plus a document on the client script changes.
         * Almost got basic design document done, included Soichi work, plans to send to list tomorrow or Thursday. 40k ft view.
         * AI: Von and Soichi to review when it comes out.
      * Discussion of key generation options - user vs OSG (Soichi)
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-3
         * DOE Grids site used browser generation of key pair, this create some support problems
         * Three ways to generate keys: (1) in browser (via Javascript or HTML5); (2) command line and paste CSR; (3) in the server
         * IE not going to support HTML5
         * Proposal is to support server-side generation.
         * Bulk-host certificate request: limits on request and per-day
         * Von&#39;s proposal is we support sever-side key generation for user certificates, with CSR-pasting as a secondary option.
         * Soichi says adding CSR-form isn&#39;t much work
         * Host certs are done primarily from the command-line today.
         * Do we need a web interface at all for host certificates? Sites with small number of hosts.
      * OSG RA/Grid Admin training plan (Mine/Von)
         * Mine not on call, Von to follow up off-list
