---++ Proposal to add x509 authentication to TWiki
   * A change that would allow users to authenticate with their existing certs.

---++ Proposal to truncate database
   * The database behind  the MyOSG &quot;RSV Status History&quot; display is getting very large (58 GB). Extrapolation indicates we will run out of disk space in ~1 year. It is proposed that entries older than one year be removed from the working copy. A full backup will be maintained. Queries needing data older than one year could be handled on a case by case basis.
   * Questions/Issues from discussion:
      * _It should be demonstrated that the backup is usable_
      * _How important is older data?_
      * _Does it get used, if so, how?_
      * _What is a reasonable period? One year? Two years?_
      * _What is the rebuild time with the full DB?_
      * _Does the SLA impose constraints? SLA for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RSVServiceLevelAgreement][RSV]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/MyOSGServiceLevelAgreement][MyOSG]]_
