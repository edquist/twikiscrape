---+ Security Announcements

The OSG Security Team makes announcements conveying sensitive information to
OSG security contacts according to the procedure defined below.
The goal of this procedure is to communicate sensitive security information to
security contacts in a timely manner without disclosing that information inappropriately.
The team may make announcements as part of 
the [[IncidentResponseProcess][incident response process]],
the [[SoftwareVulnerabilityHandling][software vulnerability handling process]],
or for other reasons.

---++ Procedure

The procedure below sends an email message to the OSG security contacts,
from the OSG security team &lt;security@opensciencegrid.org&gt;.
The email message does not contain sensitive information.
Rather, the email message contains the URL to a GOC Security Ticket,
which contains the sensitive information.
All OSG contacts registered in OIM can view GOC Security Tickets
by authenticating via their web browser using the certificate registered in OIM.

   1 *Assign Responsibility*
      1 The security team must first determine who will make the announcement. Typically someone will volunteer. Otherwise the Security Officer, Deputy Security Officer, or lead responder for a  [[IncidentResponseProcess][security incident]] will assign someone.
      1 The responsible person sends notification that he or she is preparing an announcement. For an incident-related announcement, the person should notify incident-discuss-l@opensciencegrid.org. For other announcements, the person should instead notify osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org.
   1 *Draft Announcement*
      1 The responsible person drafts the text for the announcement: both the email message and the ticket. Email templates are provided below. Drafts may be discussed on incident-discuss-l@opensciencegrid.org or osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org as appropriate.
         * The email message should indicate the type of announcement (informational versus action required), the urgency of the announcement (action required within one business day? within one week?), and the target recipients of the message (site admins, VO admins, only T3s). While the security contacts are expected to keep the email message private, it should not include sensitive information that we wouldn&#39;t want disclosed, because mistakes happen. Sensitive information goes in the ticket.
         * The text for the ticket should not use any fancy formatting. The ticketing system will remove leading whitespaces and HTML formatting. Formatting changes of the ticket text will often break PGP or S/MIME signatures, so it&#39;s best not to include them in the ticket.
         * The ticket text should contain information appropriate for disclosure to all OSG security contacts. It should provide contacts the information they need to take action, but specific details such as the identity of compromised sites or other sensitive information that the security contacts do not need to know should not be included. Obviously this is a judgment call depending on the specifics of the current issue. Always ask the provider of the sensitive information if it&#39;s OK to disclose it to the OSG security contacts.
      1 When an announcement draft is ready, the responsible person forwards the draft to osg-et@opensciencegrid.org for approval. Do not proceed without ET approval unless the Security Officer makes an exception.
   1 *Create Security Ticket*
      1 Open https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open and authenticate with your registered certificate.
      1 Under the &quot;OSG security staff&quot; section, select the link to Create Security Notification Ticket.
      1 For the *Title*, enter *OSG-SEC-YYYY-MM-DD*, this may be automatically filled in (replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the date of the announcement).
      1 For the *Detail*, enter the ticket contents. Note that tickets are append-only. Once you submit information, it can&#39;t be modified.
      1 Do *not* mark the ticket as critical priority.
      1 Submit the ticket.
      1 Do NOT close the ticket. 
      1 Update your email draft with the URL of the ticket you just created.
   1 *Send the Email*
      1 Sign the email content with the security@opensciencegrid.org PGP key according to [[SecurityTeam.SecureEmailKeyManagement#PGP_message_signing][these instructions]].
      1 Open https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open and authenticate with your registered certificate.
      1 Under the &quot;OSG security staff&quot; section, select the link to &quot;Send Notification Email&quot;.
      1 For the *Subject*, enter *OSG-SEC-YYYY-MM-DD* (replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the date of the announcement).
      1 For the *Content*, paste in your PGP-signed message (that was approved by the ET).
      1 Select all three checkboxes for *Security Contacts*. That indicates the message will be privately send to the security contacts registered in OIM.
      1 Do *not* select any *Mailing Lists*. That option is for public announcements.
      1 After a final review of the message, click the *Submit* button.
      1 Verify that the message was sent. All Security Team members should receive the announcement, since the Security Team is registered as a security contact in OIM. In case of problems, contact the [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/][GOC]].
   1 *Update the Ticket (If Required)*
      * In case the information in the ticket requires updating or correction, edit the ticket, add a new *Description*, and click *Update*. This will append a new description at the top of the ticket display. There is no mechanism for editing existing descriptions. Tickets are append-only.
      * For significant updates, it may be necessary to start over and send a new email message.
