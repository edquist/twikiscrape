---+ OSG Software: An Introduction


Welcome to Open Science Grid! We&amp;rsquo;re glad to have you here. 

Everyone wants to just quickly download the OSG software and get on with their lives. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not so simple, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to do some planning and configuration to make a good OSG site. 

By the way, this guide is intended for system administrators who are running OSG services (a computing element, a storage element, a virtual organization, etc). While there is included information about installing and using OSG client software, the documentation does not cover general OSG user support issues.

There is a five step process to installing the OSG software:

   1. [[ReleaseDocumentation/SitePlanning][Plan your site]] If you are doing anything larger than a small test site, you need to plan what you are doing before you install anything. This step is critical!
   2. *Install the software you need* There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single set of software. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to select the bits that are appropriate for your site. You are likely to be installing software on more than one computer. Many people expect to install software with RPM or a similar tool. We do not use RPM right now, but use a tool called [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationPacmanInstall][Pacman]]. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice tool, but it might take a few minutes to get used to if you are familiar with RPM.
   3. *Configure the software* As much as possible, we pre-configure the software, but we cannot do that completely because your site has individual characteristics under your control. Much of the configuration will be done by running a small program (=configure-osg=), and you might need to do some by hand. 
   4. *Validate your installation* Once you&#39;ve installed everything, you should test your installation. We provide some tools for testing the installation.
   5. *Have fun!* You&#39;re ready to go! 

There are many details in each of these steps. Please look through the rest of our documentation to understand the process.
