---++ About This Document

%ICON{&quot;hand&quot;}% The OSG generally accepts X509 certificates issued by Certification Authorities accredited by the [[http://www.igtf.net/][IGTF]] from many different locations around the world.  Most people working with OSG may obtain certificates from the DOEGrids CA and these instructions apply only to DOEGrids.  For information on others, contact your [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?datasource=summary&amp;all_vos=on&amp;active_value=1][VO&#39;s Support Center]]. 
Certificates and their uses, particularly user certificates (also called personal certificates) are described in [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][Documentation.CertificateWhatIs]].  

---++ Obtaining a Personal Grid Certificate

There are a set of scripts distributed in VDT which provide the most convenient
method of obtaining a certificate but one can also use a web browser to request and download certificates.  The web browser is convenient for web and email uses while the scripts are most convenient for shell command grid activities. 
This is described in [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateUserGet][How do I get a DOEGrids Digital PKI/X509 Personal Certificate?]].
