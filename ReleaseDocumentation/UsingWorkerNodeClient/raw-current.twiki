---++ Introduction

The Worker Node Client is a collection of useful software components that is guaranteed to be on every OSG worker node. In addition, a job running on a worker node can access a handful of environment variables that your job can use to locate the Worker Node Client software and other handy resources.

This page describes how to initialize the environment of your job to correctly access the execution and data areas from the worker node.

The OSG provides no scientific software dependencies or software build tools on the worker node; you are expected to bring along all application-level dependencies yourself. Sites are not required to provide any specific tools (gcc, svn, lapack, blas, etc.) beyond the ones in the OSG worker node client. 


---++ Setting Up Environment

All OSG sites should be configured so that the =$OSG_GRID= environment variable is already defined when your job starts running. The first command that a job should execute after it is started in a batch slot at an OSG site is:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;userinput&gt;. $OSG_GRID/setup.sh&lt;/userinput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=setup.sh= sets several environment variables and configures the worker node client tools.
The following is output from a test run of a job with the scripts configured correctly:

%TWISTY{

---++ Directories in the Worker Node Environment

The following table outlines the various important directories for the worker node environment. A job running on an OSG worker node can refer to each directory using the corresponding environment variable.

%EDITTABLE{ header=&quot;| *Environment Variable* | *Purpose of a directory* | *Notes* |&quot; format=&quot;| text | textarea, 2x30 | textarea, 2x30 |&quot; changerows=&quot;on&quot; }%
| *Environment Variable* | *Purpose of a directory* | *Notes* |
| =$OSG_APP= | Location for users to install software. | This directory is used by VO&#39;s to install software that will be used when running on the cluster.  For example, a VO may install the BLAST executable here.  The VO would submit jobs that executed the blast executable.  Access to this area varies from site-to-site.  Most sites allow software installation only from the head node (jobmanager-fork), while others require you to access it via a special job description of VOMS role. |
| =$OSG_DATA= | Data files that are accessible via NFS from all batch slots, read-write. | %RED% Not all OSG sites have deployed this area %ENDCOLOR%  You can test for existance by comparing the environment variable =$OSG_DATA= to =UNAVAILABLE=.  If true, then the directory is not available. |
| =$OSG_GRID= | Contains the Worker Node Client software tools |  |
| =$OSG_WN_TMP= | Temporary storage area in which your job(s) run | Local to each batch slot.  Create a directory under this as your work area.  See NOTE below. |

%NOTE% Be careful with using =$OSG_WN_TMP=, this  directory might be shared with other VOs.  We recommend the following code (suppose =gpn= is your VO&#39;s name):

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
mkdir -p $OSG_WN_TMP/gpn
export mydir=`mktemp -d -t gpn`
cd $mydir
# Run the rest of your application
rm -rf $mydir
&lt;/pre&gt;

A significant number of sites use the batch system to make an independent directory for each user job, and change =$OSG_WN_TMP= on the fly to point to this directory.

There is no way to know in advance how much scratch disk space any given worker node has available, as OSG information systems don&#39;t advertise this.  Most of the times, it is shared among a number of job slots.

---++ Input and Output Files Specified Via Condor-G

Condor-G has the following attributes related to file transfers and your jobs:

| =executable= | one file |
| =output= | one file - stdout | 
| =error= | one file - stderr |
| =transfer_input_files= | comma separated list of files |
| =transfer_output_files= | comma separated list of files |

Do not use =transfer_input_files= or =transfer_output_files= to transfer more than a few megabytes: These files are transfered via the CE headnode and can cause serious loads, which can bring down the cluster.  Space on the headnode also tends to be limited, especially because some sites place a very small quota on your home directory. To transfer large files, we recommend pre-staging as covered by [[Storage/WebHome#Storage_for_the_End_User][the OSG-Storage documentation]].

--&gt;

&lt;!--
---++ Finding your way around

%NOTE% A definition of the concepts used in this document can be found in [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]], including a section describing minimal requirements and some sample configurations.

Here we describe how to find the various storage locations. We start by describing how to find things after your job starts, and then complete the discussion by describing what you can determine from the outside, before you submit a job to the site. We deliberately do not describe what these various storage implementations are. That is done in the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] document.




&lt;br/&gt;

See the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationComputeElementInstall][CE Install Guide]] and [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] for more information. 

---+++ !!Getting information about CE storage before you submit a job

You can retrieve the storage information for some sites by querying the OSG information services. We do not recommend using this method — instead, have the job discover the correct directory through its environment. This will not work reliably at all sites.

We will illustrate this below using !ReSS.

%TWISTY{
mode=&quot;div&quot;
showlink=&quot;Show unrecommended query method...&quot;
hidelink=&quot;Hide queries&quot;
showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
}%
The following query looks for storage directories for sites that support CMS (change &quot;VO:cms&quot; with the name of your VO):
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
&lt;userinput&gt;condor_status -pool osg-ress-1.fnal.gov -const &#39;stringListIMember(&quot;VO:cms&quot;, GlueCEAccessControlBaseRule)&#39; -format &#39;CE: %s &#39; GlueCEUniqueID -format &#39;OSG_WN_SCRATCH: %s &#39; GlueSubClusterWNTmpDir -format &#39;OSG_DATA: %s &#39; GlueCEInfoDataDir -format &#39;OSG_APP: %s\n&#39; GlueCEInfoApplicationDir | sort | uniq&lt;/userinput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The reason the query is so long is due to the extensive format strings.  The above query shows the scratch, app, and data directories - one line per CE.  Here&#39;s a few lines of output:
