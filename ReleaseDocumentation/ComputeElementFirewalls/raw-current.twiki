%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. A brief description of services provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% will be given, followed by recommendations how to adjust the firewall for their correct operation. [[ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client]] installations only have to worry about the =GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE= and =GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=.

---+ Introduction

Network traffic may be blocked by a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28networking%29][firewall]] for inbound and outbound traffic in dependence on host- and domain names, IP addresses, port numbers and protocols. In this document we distinguish between two types of firewalls:

   1 network firewalls administrated centrally and typically outside of your administrative domain
   1 host-based firewalls within your administrative domain

The protocol and port requirements for a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% are listed below. Please provide them to the administrator of a _network firewall_ potentially blocking network traffic to your host. Next, follow the instructions to adjust the firewall settings on your host-based firewall.

---+ Requirements

   1 be familiar with your institute&#39;s network policy and firewall configuration
   1 _root_ access is required to configure a host-based firewall using =iptables=

---+ Host-based Firewall Configuration

The default firewall configuration for !RedHat&#39;s iptables defines a stateful packet filter; no ports that are not explicitly opened by =iptables= will be open. This includes high numbered ports that are often used by grid services. 

If your preference is to leave as much of the stateful packet filtering in place but enable just those grid services you want to deploy, then you can use the following instructions. On RHEL or similar systems the firewall is configured using the =/etc/sysconfig/iptables= file:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport %RED%&amp;lt;begin port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%:%RED%&amp;lt;end port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR% -j ACCEPT
# Monalisa, grabs 3 ports from the following range
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9000:9010 -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p udp -m udp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT
# GRAM
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2119 -j ACCEPT
# Gridftp
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2811 -j ACCEPT
# Optional Services
# RLS Server
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 39281 -j ACCEPT
# MyProxy
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 7512 -j ACCEPT
# GSISSH/SSH
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# MDS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2135 -j ACCEPT
# GIIS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2136 -j ACCEPT
# GUMS/VOMS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
# WebServices
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9443 -j ACCEPT
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% Please open the range of [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Define_Globus_Port_Ranges][Globus Ports]] according to your Compute Element configuration. Also, if you are using a *Scientific Linux* variant (*SL*, *SLF*, or *SLC*), then you may have to change =RH-Firewall-1-INPUT= above to =INPUT=. Just model the rules after the ones already existing in your =iptables= file.

Finally restart the firewall as the _root_ user for changes to take effect:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables restart
  Flushing firewall rules:                                   [  OK  ]
  Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter                    [  OK  ]
  Unloading iptables modules:                                [  OK  ]
  Applying iptables firewall rules:                          [  OK  ]

%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload
  Reloading configuration:                                   [  OK  ] 
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+ Stateful Firewalls

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful_firewall][Stateful Firewall]] keeps track of the state of network connections. If a TCP connection is closed unexpectedly a stateful firewall will not know that it has been closed. In this case the operating system may allow programs to reuse the port number, but the firewall will not.

To avoid using the same ports too quickly, and hopefully avoid the situation where a stateful firewall will not allow a port to be reused. The %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% keeps a record of TCP ports using two files which are defined by two environment variables.

%STARTSECTION{&quot;VDT_CONFIG&quot;}%
The two variables are defined in =%UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh= for the Bourne Shell:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# This file is sourced by setup.sh.  Use it for any custom setup for this site.
# This file will be preserved across VDT installations if OLD_VDT_LOCATION is set.

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE to define communication ports for inbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%&amp;lt;begin port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&amp;lt;end port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE to define communication ports for outbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%&amp;lt;begin port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&amp;lt;end port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for outbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE=%RED%&amp;lt;location on file system&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for inbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE=%RED%&amp;lt;location on file system&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

and for the TC Shell in =%UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.csh= :

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# This file is sourced by setup.sh.  Use it for any custom setup for this site.
# This file will be preserved across VDT installations if OLD_VDT_LOCATION is set.

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE to define communication ports for inbound connections.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE %RED%&amp;lt;begin port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&amp;lt;end port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE to define communication ports for outbound connections.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE %RED%&amp;lt;begin port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&amp;lt;end port&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for outbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE %RED%&amp;lt;location on file system&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for inbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE %RED%&amp;lt;location on file system&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;
%ENDSECTION{&quot;VDT_CONFIG&quot;}%

---+ Additional Steps for Scientific Linux

Scientific Linux uses =/etc/hosts.deny= to block all connections requests. Please add following lines to =/etc/hosts.allow= to open access to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
  %UCL_CWD%/vdt/services/vdt-run-gsiftp.sh : ALL
  %UCL_CWD%/vdt/services/vdt-run-globus-gatekeeper.sh : ALL
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+ Testing and Monitoring

Use =telnet= to check whether the ports required are accessible on your %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% or %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% by trying to connect to the respective TCP port from the outside:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% telnet &amp;lt;the FQDN of the CE or SE&amp;gt; &amp;lt;port number to check&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The port is accessible if you get a response. Otherwise =telnet= will hang or report a _no route to host_ error.

If you configured =iptables= to log events, you should be able to see blocked events by inspecting =/var/log/messages=.
