---++ About This Document
These are the first steps one can take when looking into an incident AFTER the incident has already been reported.

%IMPORTANT% If you have not reported the incident to your local security team AND the OSG security team, [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/IncidentDiscoveryReporting][report the incident]] now. 

You will first want to notify your local security contacts. The local security contacts will help with hands-on examination. Then, make sure to report the incident to OSG.

---++ Compromised Machine

If it is initially determined that the machine has been compromised, then here are a couple of steps to take:

   %IMPORTANT% Do not turn the machine off. There may be processes and/or live data that an incident responder may want to obtain on the machine.
   %IMPORTANT% Do not delete any files. Do not wipe off and re-install the system. 
   * Get the machine off the network so it cannot do any more damage.  The easiest way to do this will be to unplug the network cable from the machine.  If this is a remote machine, or you are not sure where the machine is, then you will likely need to contact the local security or networking group and have them block the machine at the border or at the network jack.

---++ Compromised Account

If you have determined that this incident has a compromised account(s) then you should follow below two steps:

   * [[BanningUsersAtSite][Banning a user]] - This will disable access for that user to your resources.&lt;BR&gt;
   * [[Documentation.CertificateRevoke][Revoking a certificate]] - This will revoke the users certificate so it will no longer work at any site.&lt;BR&gt;

---+ Additional Steps

If you are tasked with doing the forensic analysis, there are additional steps you can take.  However, if an administrator or security engineer is going to be looking into the incident then you should leave the basic forensic analysis to them to insure that no data is destroyed during the investigation.
