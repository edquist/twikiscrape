---+++ Rules for topics and template
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+*&lt;nop&gt;Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!
   * All level two sections should be in title case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the Installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * All sections (level three and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---+++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * Exclude from the TOC all sections level three and below (=---+++=, =---++++=, etc.).  To accomplish this,  use !%TOC{depth=&quot;2&quot;}%
   * Include COMPLETE, RESPONSIBLE, and REVIEW directives at the bottom. 
   * [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationExampleMainTopic]] for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * [[ExampleTopicInclude]] for a topic likely to included in other topics, so =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= and =EDITTHIS= directives are used.
   * [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationExampleCompositeDocument]] what a composite document of includes should look like.
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Avoid nested INCLUDES.
   * Here is the WebTopicEditTemplate for newly created pages in this twiki, which are assumed to be included in other topics.
   * For content that is OSG 1.2 specific, use the *STARTOSG12* variable to before the content and *ENDOSG12* after the content.  E.g. =%&lt;nop&gt;STARTOSG12% OSG 1.2 content %&lt;nop&gt;ENDOSG12%=.  You need to place a space between the =%&lt;nop&gt;STARTOSG12%= tag and the content.

---+++ Screen Views
Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:

For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a &quot;screen&quot; view:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
command 1
command 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
which looks like:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
command 1
command 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
---+++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a &quot;file&quot; view:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
line 1
line 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
which looks like:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
line 1
line 2
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Variables
See WebPreferences for settings of the following variables.

   * OSG release variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;OSG_VERSION%* = %OSG_VERSION%
   * ITB release variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;ITB_VERSION%* = %ITB_VERSION%
   * VDT release variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_VERSION%* = %VDT_VERSION%
   * Release variable, according to cache (ITB or OSG): *%&lt;nop&gt;VERSION%* = %VERSION%
   * VDT cache variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_CACHE%* = %VDT_CACHE%
   * ITB/OSG cache/grid variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;CACHE%* = %CACHE%
      * Use the  *%&lt;nop&gt;CACHE%* variable as a generic reference for either &quot;ITB&quot; or &quot;OSG&quot; *caches*, *grids*, etc.  It automatically expands to &quot;ITB&quot; if its in the Trash/Trash/Integration web, or to &quot;OSG&quot; if its in the production release documentation web.
   * Refer to the cache/version combination that you&#39;re using, e.g, %CACHE% %VERSION%, with a space in between, as %BR% %BLUE% %&lt;nop&gt;CACHE% %&lt;nop&gt;VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%
   * Full URL to base of VDT Documentation for current release *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_DOCS_URL%*: %VDT_DOCS_URL%
   * Full URL to VDT Cache for this release: *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_CACHE_URL%*: %VDT_CACHE_URL%
   * Full URL to OSG Cache (ITB or Production) for this release *%&lt;nop&gt;OSG_CACHE_URL%*: %OSG_CACHE_URL%
   * Pacman version: *%&lt;nop&gt;PACMAN_VERSION%*: %PACMAN_VERSION%
