---++ About This Document
This document describes the different methods of how to ban users in OSG whether sites are using GUMS or gridmap files for authorization.

AP Comment: I believe we need to add how to do banning in GUMS 1.4 before we release this document

---++ Sites using GUMS 1.3
   * Go to the GUMS web interface
      * https://gums-host:8443/gums/
   * Add new  manual group called banned
      * Configuration -&gt; User Groups -&gt; Add
      * Select type = manual and provide name, description. Then save
   * Add this group to a “banned user group”
      * Click on Configuration 
      * Select the group from drop down menu and save
   * Add user FQAN to the banned group
      * Click on “Manual User Group Members” in “User Management” section
      * Click Add, select the appropriate “user group”
      * Add the user FQAN and save
       %IMPORTANT% We have noticed that just banning DNs instead of FQANs does not work. So please remember to ban FQAN.
   * Test the mapping from your CE (as su)
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT%gums-host mapUser %RED%&quot;DN&quot;%ENDCOLOR% 
null
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Only if the mapping returns null, the user is banned

---++ Sites using GUMS 1.2
   * No banning option is available directly in GUMS 1.2.x.
   * To ban users an upgrade to 1.3.x is required

---++ Sites using edg-mkgridmap
   * Update the edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf (in $VDT_LOCATION)
      * Add a line &#39;deny “DN”&#39;  
      * Wild cards are also accepted
      * Regenerate grid-mapfile executing  edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
      * Log file can be generally found at edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log
   * Check your grid-mapfile and confirm that the DN has indeed been removed
