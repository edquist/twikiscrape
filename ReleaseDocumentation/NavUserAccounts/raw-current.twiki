---+!! Grid User Accounts
%TOC%

%ICON{&quot;hand&quot;}% The %LINK_OSG% provides access to [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsComputeElement][compute]] and [[Documentation/GlossaryS#DefsStorageElement][storage]] resources using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509][X509]] [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificates]] which are part of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure][Public Key Infrastructure]]. Grid User Certificates are just another form of authorization and are as easy to use as passwords or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_public_key][ssh keys]]. The technical details and the implementation of the public key infrastructure do not need to be a concern to the grid user.

Each [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificate]] is associated with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%; a unique string containing the full name of the grid user for identification. This _DN_ is used by resource providers to map grid users to local Unix accounts on the compute and storage resources.

---+ Apply for a Grid User Certificate

The preferred way to apply for a [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificate]] is using your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGetWeb][web browser]]. Once the Grid Certificate will be issued you may _export_ and _install_ it on a Unix resource to use it.

Alternatively use the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGetCmd][Unix command line]] to apply for a Grid User Certificate. Once the Grid Certificate will be issued you should _import_ it into your web browser in order to access the [[Main][!Twiki]] and to open tickets with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET%.

---+ Test your Grid User Certificate

Install the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client Tools]] on a Unix resource to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCertificate#TestPGC][test]] your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificate]] and to access [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsComputeElement][compute]] and [[Documentation/GlossaryS#DefsStorageElement][storage]] resources provided by the %LINK_OSG%.

---+ A Word of Advice

Your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificate]] potentially provides you access to large amounts of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsComputeElement][compute cycles]] and [[Documentation/GlossaryS#DefsStorageElement][storage space]]. Safeguard your Grid User Certificate and associated _password_ with the same care used to protect your Social Security Number or Bank Account Information. Contact the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% if you suspect your Grid User Certificate has been compromised!
