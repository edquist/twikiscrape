---++ About This Document
This the home page for documenting the cert-scripts package that provides a command-line interface to the DOEGrids CA website and some additional utilities for dealing with X509 certificates.  This package was developed originally by the PPDG project and is now maintained by the OSG RA.

As an alternative to the web browser interface, these scripts are contributed to the DOEGrids PKI to allow a command-line interface to the certificate authority for submitting certificate requests, retrieving signed certificates, renewing certificates, directory lookup of existing certificates, and checking the remaining lifetime of certificates and certificate revocation lists. They work directly with the PEM format files used by Globus. These are perl scripts and bash shell scripts (some awk), depend upon openssl, ldapsearch and the perl LWP:: module with [[http://search.cpan.org/src/GAAS/libwww-perl-5.803/README.SSL][SSL support]]. Click on the File link below for the usage description of the script, or to download the tar file package containing the scripts. These scripts have been tested for work with VDT 1.1.2 and 1.3.1. They are included with [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu][VDT]], starting with 1.3.1.

Release notes are included in the README file linked below.

---++ Examples

---+++ get http service certificate with cert-gridadmin
This example uses the gridadmin authorized certificate and key files in the default Globus location of ~/.globus/usercert.pem and ~/.globus/userkey.pem, and generates the service certificate files as &lt;tt&gt;http-myhostcert.pem&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;http-myhostkey.pem&lt;/tt&gt; in the current working directory.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% cert-gridadmin --host dlolson.lbl.gov --service http --email dlolson@lbl.gov \
   --affiliation osg --vo osg --prefix http-myhost

The next prompt should be for the passphrase for your
personal certificate which has been authorized to access the
gridadmin interface for this CA.
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Your new certificate and key files are ./http-myhostcert.pem ./http-myhostkey.pem
move and rename them as you wish but be sure to protect the
key since it is not encrypted and password protected.
