The OSG CE configuration step will require you to fill in many values into a configuration file called =config.ini=.  The most comprehensive guide to =config.ini= [[ConfigurationFileHelp][is here]].  We recommend keeping that handy for reference, but there is no need to read it before install.

Before you configure the OSG CE, we recommend the following:
   * Know what grid your site belongs to - the *OSG* (production CEs) or the *OSG-ITB* (dedicated integration/testing for the OSG).
   * Know your CE&#39;s *resource* name and *resouce group*.  These are values that you filled out when you registered the site in [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]].
   * Determine your site sponsors.  These are the VOs that own the computing resources behind the CE (these must be valid VOs with the exception of &quot;local&quot; for locally-owned resources).  Know approximately what percentage each VO owns.
   * Understand your site&#39;s storage setup; this is described in detail in the a separate [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] document.

---++ Introduction

This section is intended to describe the information you will need available to configure your compute element. It also provides some general guidelines for your physical configuration of hosts and file systems.  A more detailed description of all of the OSG attributes (variables) can be found in [[EnvironmentVariables][OSG Configuration Parameters]].  *You will need to fill in this information into the config.ini file, when you run the =configure-osg= script after installing the OSG CE software.*   Note also you can re-use configuration settings from previous installs, see ReusingConfigurationInformation.

---++ Requested information

| *GENERAL INFORMATION* ||
| *OSG Group* | Identifies the grid that your site is participating in. For production sites, set this to *OSG*; for the integration testbed sites, set this to *OSG-ITB*. |
| *Resource Name* | _See_ ResourceName.  This is the resource name for this CE as registered with the OSG in [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]]. |
| *Resource Group Name* | _See_ ResourceName.  This is the resource_group for this CE as registered in OIM. |
| *Sponsors* | The VO sponsors for your site (e.g., =usatlas=, =ivdgl=, =ligo=, =uscms=, =sdss=). You must express the percentage of sponsorship using the following notation: %BR% =myvo:50 yourvo:10 anothervo:20 local:20= |
| *Policy URL* | The URL for the document describing the usage policy/agreement for this resource. |
 |*CONTACT INFORMATION* ||
| *Contact name* | The site administrator&#39;s full name. |
| *Contact email* | The site adminstrator&#39;s email address. |
| *SERVER LOCATION* ||
| *City* | The city your server is located in or near. |
| *Country* | The country your server is located in. For many OSG sites, this should be set to USA.|
| *Longitude/Latitude* | For your city. This  will determine your placement on any world maps used for monitoring.  You can find some approximate values for your geographic location from [[http://geotags.com/][GeoTags]] or you can search your location on [[http://www.google.com][Google]]. For the USA, latitude  is about 29 (South) ... 48 (North) %BB% longitude is about -123 (west coast) ... -71 (east coast) |
| *LOCAL STORAGE INFORMATION* ||
| * *  | _Variables such as GRID, APP, DATA, and so on define various storage locations available on your site for jobs.  These are described in detail in the a separate [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] document._ It also provides recommendations for the definitions and environment variables for the Local Storage accessible to Compute Elements on OSG. It covers the definition of these spaces and correspondences to external schemas (e.g. GLUE, OSG).|

| *GRID* | Location where the OSG WN Client (=wn-client.pacman=) has  been installed. |
| *APP* | Typically used to store the applications which will run on this gatekeeper. |
| *DATA* | Typically used to hold output from jobs while it is staged out to a Storage Element. |
| *WN_TMP* | Used to hold input and output from jobs on a worker node where the application is executing. |
| *Storage Element (SE)* | This is the Storage Element (SE) that is visible from all worker nodes accessible via this server (CE). It may be a SE local or close to the CE that is preferred as destination SE if the job does not have other preferences. |
| *SITE_READ* | Used to stage-in input for jobs using a Storage Element or for persistent storage between jobs.  It may be the mount point of a dCache SE accessed read-only using dcap. |
| *SITE_WRITE* | Used to store to a Storage Element output from jobs or forpersistent storage between jobs.  It may be the mount point of a dCache SE accessed write-only using dcap. |

| *&lt;nop&gt;Trash/Integration.MonALISA MONITORING INFORMATION* ||
|| _This information will only be required if you intend to activate [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA][Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA]]._ |
| *Ganglia host* | The host machine ganglia is running on. _(If ganglia is being used to monitor your cluster)_ |
| *Ganglia port* | The host machine&#39;s port ganglia is using. _(If ganglia is being used to monitor your cluster)_ |
| *VO Modules* | If =y=, will activate the VO Modules module in the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA][Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA]] configuration file. |

| *SQUID WEB PROXY SERVER* ||
| * * | The following questions only get asked if you indicate that you want to use squid when running configure-osg.py |
| *Squid Location* | The host machine on which squid is running.  This is usually a cluster machine with sufficient memory and disk space to cache incoming and outgoing web traffic and store any file that clients may download. |
| *Memory Cache Size* | The amount of memory that squid should use for caching downloads and files.  This may be temporarily exceeded if squid is proxying a very large download.  Setting this to more than 512MB should improve download performance significantly. |
| *Disk Cache Size* | The amount of disk space that squid should use for storing cached objects.  This should be set to a value larger than 2-3GB  for optimum benefits. |
| *GIP GENERIC INFORMATION PROVIDER INFORMATION* ||
| *SE Sitename* | This is the registered OSG sitename for the SE that is being used for the cluster _(If an SE is available)_ |
| *SE Hostname* | The hostname for the SE that is being used for the cluster _(If an SE is available)_ |
| *Root directory* | The full path to the root directory of the se (e.g. =/pnfs/osgsite.edu/data= |
| *Local directories* | The directory paths relative to the root directory for each vo to use on the SE.  This is either a single path if the simplified option is used or a path for each VO will be requested if the simplified option is not choosen. |
| *GSIFTP server* | The hostname for a gsiftp server associated with the cluster (the hostname of the CE can be used if there is no dedicated gsiftp server) |
| *Access Path* | The access path to use with the gsiftp server. | 
| *BATCH QUEUE MANAGER INFORMATION* ||
|*Condor* | The values of VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION and VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG are needed and these environment variables should be set before the pacman packages are installed |
|*SGE* | The value of SGE_ROOT is needed|
| *PBS and LSF* | No environment  variable is needed but the PBS and/or LSF executables must be in your $PATH |
