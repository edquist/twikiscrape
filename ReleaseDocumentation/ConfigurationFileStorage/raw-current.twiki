---++ Introduction to Storage Section

This section gives information about the options in the Storage section of the configuration file. Several of these values are constrained and need to be set in a way that is consistent with one of the OSG storage models.  Please review the Storage Related Parameters section of the [[EnvironmentVariables][Environment Variables]] description as well as the [[OverviewOfServicesInOSG][Overview of Services]] and [[SitePlanning][Site Planning]] discussions for explanations of the various storage models and the requirements for them.

---++ Options

The options given in bold type are mandatory.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *se_available* | =True=, =False= | This indicates whether there is an associated SE available.  It should be set to True or False. |
| default_se | String | If an SE is available at your cluster, set default_se to the hostname of this SE, otherwise set default_se to UNAVAILABLE. |
| *grid_dir* | String | The grid_dir setting should point to the directory which holds the files from the OSG worker node package. It should be visible on all of the computer nodes and will be accessed via the $OSG_GRID environment variable.  Read access is required, though worker nodes don&#39;t need write access. |
| *app_dir* | String | The app_dir setting should point to the directory which contains the VO  specific applications, this should be visible on both the CE and worker nodes and will be accessed via $OSG_APP.  Only the CE needs to have write access to this directory. The $OSG_APP directory must also contain a sub-directory (etc) with 1777 permissions. |
| data_dir | String | The data_dir setting should point to a directory that can be used to store and stage data in and out of the cluster and accessed via the $OSG_DATA variable.  This directory should be readable and writable on both the CE and worker nodes.  |
| worker_node_temp | String | The worker_node_temp directory (accessed via $OSG_WN_TMP) should point to a directory that can be used as scratch space on compute nodes. It should allow read and write access on a worker node and can be visable to just that worker node. If not set, the default is UNAVAILABLE |
| site_read | String | The site_read setting should be the location or url to a directory that can  be read to stage in data via the variable $OSG_SITE_READ.  This is an url if you are using a SE.  If not set, the default is UNAVAILABLE |
