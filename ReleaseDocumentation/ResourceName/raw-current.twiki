Each OSG resource needs a unique name by which services and resources may refer to the resource.  This name will be displayed on the resource catalog, the OSG Information Management System ([[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]]) and used for monitoring and accounting. For example, the resource at University of New Mexico has a unique name of UNM_HPC.

In addition to the resource name, the resource usually belongs to a logical group, called the *resource group*.  This is also registered in OIM.  For small sites, there may only a be a CE, so the resource name can be used as the resource group name.  Larger clusters might have multiple CEs or an attached storage element (SE); all of the CEs and SEs for a single cluster should be in the same resource group.

%WARNING% The default name in most configuration scripts is the hostname of the node the installation is performed on.  Do not use this name.

%IMPORTANT% It is important that system administrators use the same resource and resource_group in all locations including the [[SitePlanning#Registering_with_OSG][registration]] step, this will allow the [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/][Grid Operations Center (GOC)]] to validate monitoring systems and other grid services

If you do not consistently use the same resource name, you may receive a helpdesk ticket from the GOC requesting you to make the change.

Currently the complete list of resource names from OIM is the authoritative list of names. The !MyOSG Information Presentation system also contain a list of current resource names across both the OSG and ITB, and can be used to determine names already in use. 

For a list of the resource names already in use, you may view:
