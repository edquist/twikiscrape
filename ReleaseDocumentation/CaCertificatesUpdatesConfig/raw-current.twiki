%EDITTHIS%

You must install the CA package (that includes CA certificates and CRLs) on your system doing the following one-time configuration.  It is not included in the OSG packages to force you to acknowledge which CA (Certification Authorities) you are accepting. Many components of the installation will not work until these certificates are installed. 

A common example is to install the OSG-provided certificates into the OSG install directory.  If you are not quite sure what to do, this is a safe, self-contained option: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;source %INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]$ source %INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]$ vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
&lt;/pre&gt;
--&gt;

Trash.ReleaseDocumentationCaCertificatesInstall documents other possible options for the CA package including but not only:
   * installing the package on a shared, or a system or arbitrary directory
   * using a preinstalled CA package
   * installing alternative CA certificates
   * using a Squid proxy to improve performance
For more information about the command =vdt-ca-manage= and about different CA distributions see http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html

There are 2 services associated with certificate authorities. These are required if this installation maintains the CA installation:
   1 _vdt-update-certs_ - a cron service that insures that future certificate updates are fetched automatically.
   1 _fetch-crl_ - a cron service that retrieves the latest certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for each CA.
