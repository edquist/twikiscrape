---++ Topics of Discussion

---+++ glexec
New glexec has option to create target proxy.  This option is turned on in EGI/EMI by default but turned off in OSG by default.
   * Will this cause problems with Nagios/SUM/??? tests?
      * Shouldn&#39;t cause any problems
   * Does the EMI2 release of gliteWMS assume that option is turned on by default?
      * not clear if the user can override the config for target proxies
      * docs need to be clearer

---+++ Register New VO
How do you register a new VO in WLCG? and get sites to allow it to run?
   * http://www.egi.eu/how-do-I/join_or_start_a_community.html
   * http://www.egi.eu/how-do-I/become_a_user.html
   * http://www.egi.eu/how-do-I/become_a_resource_provider.html

WLCG Meeting went fine
    To date we have been successful
    to keep ops running - labor intensive
    no clear roadmap yet - in development

---+++ Condor Upgrade in EMI
Condor-G bug for new ARC servers - Condor team fixed
   * patch needs to be explicitly applied to latest release...

OSG3 bug (short proxies) fixed, glite side? - not yet (find ticket)
