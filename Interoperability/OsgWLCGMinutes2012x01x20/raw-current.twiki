---++ Topics of Discussion

   * VOMS-Admin
      * Nothing will change on the WLCG side regarding changing from VOMRS to VOMS-Admin until issues are addressed

   * Question regarding how Access and Mapping is handled in WLCG
      * The gLite stack uses Argus
         * Argus is the service for access and mapping (similar to GUMS)
         * Not all sites use it yet, but are transistioning
         * Argus == GUMS + SAZ

   * Rob G. - ATLAS
      * still plan on performing HammerCloud testing against pre-release EGI software

   * Discussed how interoperability is being done.  Asked for mailing lists to get a feel for upcoming software lists
      * example of the ATLAS problem that drives this request:
         * wn-client -
            * EGI validates the releases to Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD)
            * site who choose to, can update to the rolling release, and test
            * there is a missing link between ATLAS/CMS interop and the sites testing
      * Getting sites that support ATLAS/CMS to participate in Staged Roll out should be driven by VO
