---++ Topics of Discussion

---+++ Computing/Storage services 
   * discussed BDII timeouts
      * was ultimately traced to CERN Firewall being hammered by buggy AFS clients

   * discussed availability monitoring and how OSG sites will take a hit for something that was completely beyond their control.
      * this will be brought up in the WLCG Operations TEG for consideration in future tools and models
      * Rob asks if we should be monitoring Networking and other low level operations.
         * it should be up to the VO to determine

   * ATLAS is having problems maintaining wn client compatibility, specifically LFC issues with python versions, etc

   * issue regarding the types of proxies
      * started by dcache, discovered that to get sha2 support for CA sigs, they had to upgrade to jglobus2.
      * the consequence is that it doesn&#39;t support legacy proxies (which we currently receive from voms-proxy-init).
      * will follow up with OSG Software

---+++ Announcements:
   * OSG Version 3.0.5 has been released
      * RPM based CE, WN Client, OSG Client, RSV, etc.
      * NOT GUMS, and a few other components
