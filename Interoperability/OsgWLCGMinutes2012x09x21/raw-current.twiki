---+++ Availability and Reliability Plots
   * Clarified the source of data for the OPS testing versus CMS testing
   * To get support for the OPS tests, have OSG GOC open a ticket

---+++ BDII Issues
   * Briefly discussed the recent BDII issues.
   * CERN&#39;s BDII was set to retain data for a very long time to prevent sites from dropping out if there were slow updates
   * however, it appears that the update process got &quot;stuck&quot; and had to be restarted
