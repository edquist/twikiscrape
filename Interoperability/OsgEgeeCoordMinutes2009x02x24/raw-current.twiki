---++ Topics of Discussion
   * Several CREAM CE instances in PPS.  
      * Being used mainly by ALICE, a bit by CMS
      * Issues
         * lack of condor-g router and ICE-enabled WMS.  So direct submission via CREAM CLI is only thing that works.  
         * proxy handling.  Several instances, some patches ... Being collected together and hoped that update to CREAM CE can be put out quite soon.  Maybe this week.  ICE-enabled WMS is also in PPS.  Nick needs to follow up on Condor-G version.  Not released into Condor 7.3?  May not be imminent?
      * BURT: &quot;I&#39;ll talk to Sanjay Padhi about making sure that CREAM CE he was testing against is current with PPS as well as sending out what people need to do to submit with condor-g.&quot;

   * Glue 2 -- Nick will follow up with Laurence.  Nick will check too.
   
   * SCAS/glexec -- now two sites.  Nick will send link to PPS website and page in there with details.

   * Burt will send transient ITB sites to list

   * heterogeneous sites wrt OS releases -- problems with advertising and how to submit...

   * List of Transient ITB sites -- Emanouil is sending jobs anyway.  He will send us a list of sites that pass the test.

   * AOB
      * Emaonuil: one question: is anyone going to the EGEE User Forum
      * Tony: PPS WMS: is it static or a moving target?  It is pps-wms.cern.ch -- DNS alias to lxplus.
