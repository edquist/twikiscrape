    &lt;li&gt;We have a new hire, Tony Tiradani, who will be working on the PPS/ITB interoperability effort. Welcome Tony!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We had some technical issues with the PPS WMS yesterday (is it still amibothered.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk?) I&#39;ll keep trying and send details of the issue if it continues.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I know Andreas is going to install gLite tarballs at client sites, but I think we should also focus on making sure that the OSG WN packages contain some minimal environment (se details later int he excerpt from the agenda) and binaries that EGEE requires (either as a failover mechanism or for backwards-compatibility). As Stefano B pointed out earlier, we should write up those requirements in a short document and I can ask the OSG Executive Team to sign off.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;OSG ITB sites should start to show up on the PPS BDII -- I sent a patch to address the earlier GIP misconfiguration, ITB sites are patching by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;OSG is interested in aggregating multiple gatekeepers into a single site (the OSG assumption was that one CE = one site previously), mainly to make sure SAM tests are properly reported. I think the change is trivial, but requires testing and the PPS/ITB is the right place for that, we&#39;ll set up some multi-CE sites on the ITB soon to try that. Excerpt from the Agenda:&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
In the OSG we have found it useful to guarantee a minimal environment that every job is safe to assume when it lands on a worker node. We will guarantee the following environment variables to be set:

$OSG_APP -- the VO application area. A supported VO must have write access to this area (although it could be restricted to a software installation role). The convention is for a VO to drop software into $OSG_APP/VOname.

$OSG_GRID -- the base location for the OSG Worker Node Client software.

$OSG_WN_TMP -- the worker-node temp directory, guaranteed for the life of the job.

If a job lands on a worker node and sources $OSG_GRID/setup.{csh,sh}, we guarantee the following software to be accessible in the environment:

* srmcp * uberftp * wget 
&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
