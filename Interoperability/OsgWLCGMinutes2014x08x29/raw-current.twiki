---++ Topics of Discussion
* The java SRM clients on lxplus (sl5) nodes cannot handle CERN&#39;s SHA-2 certificates.  Most CMS software uses lcg* tools now, so there is minimal impact.  The SL6 nodes can access the EMI client from CVMFS and those SRM tools work fine.

* Note that lxplus5 does not come with a &quot;native&quot; grid UI.  Instead, one can set up the old gLite AFS UI which is not supported beyond the bare minimum (e.g. updates of the VOMS configuration).  In principle lxplus5 could be
equipped with the EMI-3 clients just like lxplus, but that would have to be agreed by all experiments, as it would interfere with legacy usage of the old AFS UI.  However, the idea was for lxplus5 to get phased out and for lxplus to provide all that is needed only on SLC6 instead.
