---++ Topics of Discussion

---+++ VOMS 3
   * Working through VOMS 3 problems
   * potential problems
      * every VO must have their own instance of VOMS-Admin, which means that each instance on a server must have a different port
      * All gridmap files will need to be updated to include the new port
      * one solution is to run a redirector
   * Waiting on service managers to update for resumed testing

---+++ SHA-2
   * CERN SHA-2 CA is up and available for limited testing
      * https://gridca.cern.ch/gridca/
      * however, not yet available outside the CERN network
   * testing UI available to get CERN SHA-2 proxies
      * emi2rc-sl5-ui.cern.ch
      * otherwise, can get the needed lsc files and host certs from links on https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/SHA2readinessTesting
   * Tony will get a CERN SHA-2 cert when access is opened up and test OSG software

---+++ glexec Deployment Requirements
   * WLCG is going to require that glexec be installed and functional on all WLCG sites
      * testing will be done through either the WLCG OPS Nagios SAM instances or the VO instances
      * CMS sites for the most part are already passing the tests
      * Maarten has requested help with OSG sites
