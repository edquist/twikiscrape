---++Trouble Ticket Exchange
---+++EGEE-&gt;OSG
From XML to FP exchange completed by Rob. Testing has been occurring and successful. Go-live date will be May 1.
---+++OSG-&gt;EGEE
There is a template for updating GGUS tickets, so that will be shared with Rob.
---+++USATLAS and USCMS 
Ruth suggested that some more testing of GGUS -&gt; OSG -&gt; Support Centers and the reverse (Ruth suggested that perhaps DZero as a candidate) be done to test what real-world exchange will be like.

---++Cross Site Registration
No registration in the GOC db for European sites. How do we register sites across the grid? WLCG should be taking information from the OSG DB, according to Ruth. Lawrence needs a page created from information in the GOC db to reference so that EGEE can populate their side. 
---+++OSG Reg DB
---+++GOCDB2

---++CE Storage Policy
---+++$HOME vs $APP/$DATA
$HOME shouldn&#39;t house any significant data, but on LCG, $HOME is used to store significant data, according to Fermilab. Significant = 2GB. Jobs are running and storing data in $HOME. The ticket is 1094. Lawrence is not sure, but thinks it will be used, but not long-term for storage. 

---++Interoperability VO
Rob will work with Lawrence on getting a message out.
Getting VO&#39;s supported: It will be up to the sites/VO&#39;s if they want to enable VO&#39;s on their site(s).
