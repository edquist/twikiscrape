---++ Topics of Discussion
---+++ Question answered from previous meeting
Who are the right people to attend this meeting?
   * Maarten and Flavia are the correct WLCG people to attend the monthly meeting.

---+++ Information Systems
   * Last meeting we discussed future plans.  We established that short term plans and immediate issues should be discussed here as well.
   * Flavia will distribute a new document that describes all the BDII attributes that are used by all the participating experiments and the supporting services
   * Discussed the use of the Information System by glideinWMS (initial discovery and downtime information)

---+++ Computing/Storage
   * Only EGI will be de-commisioning LCG-CE&#39;s
      * WLCG in EGI - (subject to Management Board decisions)
         * by April you must have a CREAM CE in good shape or you fail availability calculations
         * depending on the readiness of ACE (availability calculation engine), there will be an OR between the LCG-CE and CREAM CE availability calculations for a few              months
         * Official support will be removed once the previous conditions have been met and testing has finished (by summer-ish)
   * For WLCG sites that have misconfigured CREAM CE&#39;s open GGUS tickets
   * OSG is working to make CREAM CE work for OSG

   * CREAM Client - Maarten has emailed Anthony the location of a stand-alone CREAM client to test out.  This will help glideinWMS &lt;--&gt; CREAM testing.
