---++ Major Releases
   1 For major releases, the release documentation tree will be copied to the ITB TWiki and then modified for the new release.  When the release goes to production, this tree will become the new production tree and the old tree will be moved to the a previous release tree.  Changes that are made to improve documents that are independent of the new release will have to be made in the ITB and production TWiki just as they are between the current and previous release.
   1 Navigation into release documentation will always default to the current release.  A pointer on the navigation page will direct a user to the documentation tree for the previous release.

---++ Point Releases
   1 For point releases with few changes, the documentation will be modified with notes so that the documents will serve for all point releases within a major release.
   1 For point releases with more extensive changes which should always be concentrated in a particular area, the (few) documents in that area (i.e. the set of documents with the more extensive changes) will be split into a version for the previous release and a version for the new release.
