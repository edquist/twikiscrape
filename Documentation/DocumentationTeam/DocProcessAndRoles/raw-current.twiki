---++ What is the Document Process?

   * A set of rules controlling the life cycle of a document:
      * document creation
      * integration into existing documentation
      * document evolution
      * document review
      * document test
      * document release
      * the archival of old documents
   * Used by a team of Twiki users with different knowledge and skills that work mostly independent!

---++ Why should we improve the current Document Process?

   * Every tool is useless without some documentation about it!
   * Poor tools can often identified by their poor documentation alone!
   * Great tools almost always supply great documentation!
   
   * The quality of documents in our Twiki varies greatly:
      * completeness of a topic
      * correctness of its content
      * layout and readability
      * outdated vs. recent information
      * ...

---++ What does the New Document Process look like?

   * Not unlike the old process, but:
      * we create new role TESTER which is different from a REVIEWER
      * we create new document states controlling which role must act on a document
      * with better control over the progress a document makes over time

---++ What does the New Document Process *look* like?

%ATTACHURL%/Slide1.jpg

---++ Demo: Where are all my Documents?

   * New User Home Pages make important information available in one place:
      * Robert: https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/RobertEngel
      * Jim   : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/JamesWeichel

---++ Demo: Assign Reviewers and Testers

   * Robert is page owner and asks Jim to review and test the page:
      * Robert: https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HelpProcedure
   * Jim gets notified on his home page:
      * Jim   : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/JamesWeichel

---++ Demo: Track Document Status

   * Enable Document Status Table on this Page (%%NOP%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%) and explain it:
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HelpProcedure
   * Jim finished reviewing and testing and flags (%%NOP%REVIEW_PASSED% = %%NOP%YES%, %%NOP%TEST_PASSED% = %%NOP%YES%):
      * Jim    : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HelpProcedure
   * Robert gets notified on his home page:
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/RobertEngel
   * Robert decides to release the page and flags (%%NOP%RELEASE_READY% = %%NOP%YES%)
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/RobertEngel
      * Jim    : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/JamesWeichel
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HelpProcedure

---++ Demo: Give Feedback to Owners, Reviewers and Testers

   * Feedback is possible using the %%NOP%COMMENT{}% Plugin.
   * We just add search to it to make it more usable.
   * Robert adds a comment for Jim on a page that Jim assigned him to review:
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/DocumentationTeam/InstallDocContent
   * Jim will be notified on his home page about Robert&#39;s latest comment:
      * Jim    : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/JamesWeichel
   * Robert also gets a copy of the comment on his page:
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/RobertEngel

---++ Demo: Tag Documents

   * Tagging is possible by using the %%NOP%COMMENT{}% Plugin.
   * A Tag is a special form of comment: TAG_NAME = TAGE_VALUE
   * Again we add search to make it more usable.
   * Robert wants to keep track of high quality documents and puts a QUALITY tag on a page:
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/DocumentationTeam/InstallDocContent
   * Robert get a table of all tagged documents on his home page:
      * Robert : https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/RobertEngel

---++ Demo: !DocFinder!

   * DocFinder is a search box tailored to the Document Process
      * https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/DocumentationTeam/FindIt
   * Search all Documents
   * Search all Documents that are associated with a Twiki User
   * Search all Documents according to their organization (Area,Role,Type)
   * Search all Documents according to their status (Review,Test,Release)
   * Search all Documents according to their tag (Tag-User,Tag-Name,Tag-Value)

---++ Comments and Questions?

   * There are performance issues we still need to solve:
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/DocumentationTeam/DocFind

   * *Our* experiences working with Twiki:
      * things that are very easy with modern tools are very difficult using Twiki
      * advantages of Twiki are slim compared to modern alternatives
      * Documentation on Twiki itself is out-dated
      * Twiki likely beyond its main life time!
      * For how long do we want to keep investing in dead technologies?
