---++ Background
In a study conduced on OSG Documentation in 2009 
(see [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=861][OSG Documentation Alignment Initiative]]),
interviews of users of Installation documents showed that their needs could be better met by structuring those 
documents around how they are most frequently used and by providing information that is needed, but that was often missing in the documents.  
These needs and the resulting requirements on the standard Installation Document 
Contents are listed below.

---++ User Needs and the Corresponding Requirement on Content
|  *User Need*  |  *Content Requirement*  |
| Optimal (concise) for most frequent use  | Put information needed one-time (e.g. initial installation) in linked pages (optimize document for 2nd to nth installation)  |
| Knowing if this is the right document  | Include Applicable Software Version information  |
| Understanding of architecture  | Basic information in-line with link to page containing more information on how this software/service fits into the whole  |
| Understanding of planning &amp; engineering  | Link to page containing planning &amp; engineering information (e.g. service should be or not be on same machine as another, configuration differences for small site vs. a large site)  |
| Knowing what is assumed  | Checklist of items assumed to be in place before this installation (e.g. other services, filesystems, port configuration, security certificates)  |
| Clear, easy-to-use procedure  | Highlight commands that must be issued, use defined variables when possible, clearly delineate file edits from commands, &amp; make commands easy to copy and paste  |
| Resolve errors  | Include debugging information (e.g. key items to check, location of logs) &amp; link to standard mechanisms in place to get help in resolving problems  |
| Ensuring installation is working  | Include Startup/Shutdown and a procedure to validate the service is working correctly |
| Understanding of unresolved issues  | Include any Caveats or Known Issues with the software  |
| To make comments for improvement  | Provide an standard and easy way to comment on document contents |

---++ Installation Document Content and Template
The content and format of installation documents that resulted from these needs and requirement is Trash.ReleaseDocumentationDocInstallTemplate.
