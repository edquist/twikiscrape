   $ EGEE: Note: This project has ended and is replaced by [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsEGI][EGI]].  The Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) project was funded by the European Commission and aimed to provide a seamless Grid infrastructure for e-Science available to scientists 24 hours-a-day. _See_ http://www.eu-egee.org/.  

#DefsEGI
   $ EGI: The European Grid Infrastructure enables access to computing resources for European researchers from all fields of science, from High Energy Physics to Humanities.  _See_ http://www.egi.eu/.

   $ ecrc&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEcrc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Enstore CRC&quot;. Ecrc is a command packaged with encp which calculates the crc of a local file. _See also:_ crc.
   $ en_check&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEnCheck&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A command packaged with encp that determines if a file is on tape. 
   $ encp&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEncp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A deprecated end-user command (designed for Enstore) used to copy data files to and from disk and storage media.  Encp also includes three diagnostic tools: ecrc, ddencp, en_check. 
   $ Enstore&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEnstore&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The mass storage system implemented at Fermilab as the primary data store for experiments&amp;#8217; data sets. It provides distributed access to data on tape or other storage media both locally and over networks. 
   $ enstore.conf&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEnstoreConf&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A configuration file to allow for multiple network interface cards dedicated to Enstore, and to map the interfaces to routers. The default location for the file is /etc/enstore.conf. The location of the file can be overridden with the environment variable ENSTORE_CONF. 
   $ ENSTORE_CONF: Environment variable that can be used to override the location of the enstore.conf file. _See_ enstore.conf. 
   $ ENSTORE_CONFIG_HOST: An environment variable which points to the Enstore server that is running the configuration server 
   $ ENSTORE_CONFIG_PORT: An environment variable which sets the port number; the value is (by convention) 7500 for all installations at Fermilab. 
   $ ensync&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEnsync&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A wrapper for encp that allows you to copy the contents of an entire directory structure to Enstore via a single command. 
   $ event relay (ER)&lt;a name=&quot;DefsEventRelay&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A server that forwards messages based on subscription. All the Enstore servers send messages to the ER. Any server may &amp;#8220;subscribe&amp;#8221; to the ER in order to have messages of particular types forwarded to it.
