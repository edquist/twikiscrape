This topic will list the children topics of any topic in which is included. It lists them in a bulleted list that is created in straight HTML because I couldn&#39;t figure out a better way with TWiki commands.

To use this topic, use __one__ of the following, since =ToolsBottomMatter= includes this topic, too:
   * =&lt;nop&gt;%INCLUDE{ &quot;Documentation.ToolsShowChildren&quot; }&lt;nop&gt;%=
   * =&lt;nop&gt;%INCLUDE{ &quot;Documentation.ToolsBottomMatter&quot; }&lt;nop&gt;%=

=============BEGIN THE INCLUDED SECTION =========
%STARTINCLUDE%
__Immediate children of this topic include the following:__
&lt;ul&gt;%CALC{ &quot;$SUBSTITUTE(%METASEARCH{type=&quot;parent&quot; web=&quot;%BASEWEB%&quot; topic=&quot;%BASETOPIC%&quot;  }%, &lt;a h, &lt;li&gt;&lt;a h, , r)&quot; }%&lt;/ul&gt;
%STOPINCLUDE%
