---+ Virtual Organization
A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Organization_%28Grid_computing%29][&lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;irtual &lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rganization]] (*VO*) is a set of groups or individuals defined by some common cyber-infrastructure need. This can be _a scientific experiment_, _a university campus_ or _a distributed research effort_. A VO represents all its members and their common needs in a grid environment.  A VO also includes the group&#39;s computing/storage resources and services. We typically use the terms site, computing element (CE), and/or storage element (SE) to refer to the resources owned and operated by a VO.  

OSG brings together many VOs for contracted and/or opportunistic sharing of resources in a grid environment, allowing for more effective use of their collective resources. Use of resources at a site is determined by a combination of the site&#39;s local policies and the user VO&#39;s policies.   VOs are responsible for contracting individually with each other for guaranteed access to resources.

Many VOs in the OSG address the specific requirements of their users with their own user support that provides more in-depth help than the OSG does ([[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?all_vos=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;datasource=summary][current VO list]]). Additionally some VOs provide dedicated resources to the OSG that provide preferred access to their members. Some VOs provide a problem specific user interface to their members. 

The OSG assumes that each user is preferably supported by their membership VO.  Each VO is expected to register with the OSG and provide support for their members. OSG support is maintained through a VO representative for each VO rather than a member of a VO.

*The OSG welcomes researchers that are not associated with a VO!* They are welcome to join the _OSG_ or _Engage_ VO. The OSG VO is inviting all users who don&#39;t need support running their application on the OSG. The Engage VO provides strong support for scientists who wish to bring their applications to the grid but who are unfamiliar with grid technologies.

Virtual Organizations (VOs) are at the heart of OSG principles and its model for operation. VOs are a collection of researchers who join together to accomplish their goals; typically they share the same mission, but that is not a requirement for establishing an OSG VO. A VO joins OSG to share their resources, computing and storage, with the other OSG VOs and to be able to access the resources provided by other OSG VOs as well as share data and resources with international computer grids (e.g. EGEE). The resources owned by a VO are often geographically distributed; a set of co-located resources are referred to as a site and thus a VO may own a number of sites. There are two key aspects of VOs: 1) the user community within a VO that submits jobs into the OSG; and 2) the set of computing and storage resources that are owned by a VO and connected to the OSG. In some cases, VOs do not bring resources to OSG and are only users of available resources on OSG.

A key principle in OSG is the autonomy of VOs that allows them to develop an operational model that best meets their science needs; this autonomy applies both to their user community and sites. OSG requires each VO to establish certain roles (i.e. VO manager, VO admin, VO Security Contact) and agree to a set of policies (e.g. Acceptable Use Policy) which allow operation of the OSG as a secure and efficient grid. VOs administer, manage, and support their own user community.	In addition, many VOs provide common software infrastructure designed to meet the specific needs of their users.	VOs as providers of resources also have great autonomy in building and

operating their sites. Sites use the OSG software stack to provide the “middleware layers” that make their sites ready for connection to the OSG. Sites set policies on how their resources will be used by their own users and other VOs; the only requirement is that sites support at least one other VO but the site controls the conditions under which that resource is available. OSG does not tightly restrict what hardware or operating system software a VO may supply or what software it may use to access OSG or provide resources on OSG: they are autonomous and are allowed to make such choices as long as they meet the basic requirements. This autonomy allows a VO to build its computing resource to meet its specific needs and makes it more likely that a VO will choose to join OSG because it doesn’t have to compromise its own needs to do so.
