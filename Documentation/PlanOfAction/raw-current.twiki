Attendees: Torre Wenaus, Frank Wuerthwein, Fred Luehring, Kyle Gross, Marcia Teckenbrock

*Frank:*

   * Happy with DocDB, however, finding things on the Twiki and to a lesser extent, the Mambo site is difficult.  (In particular, getting to the Twiki is hard, unless one knows to click on the right orange link).

   * Organize Twiki, because TWiki search is inherently bad.
   * Search on Mambo

&lt;hr&gt;

   * Speed is also an issue, especially on mambo site, however, the mambo site will move to a faster machine very soon. - Taken Care of

&lt;hr&gt;

   * Weakest parts of site are the Grid Support/Using OSG sections.  Decent information is lacking.


   * Frank and Ruth to discuss the Grid Support / Using OSG Sections.  They will decide how to proceed.
&lt;hr&gt;


   * Frank stated previously that he would work on some of the documentation, and reiterated that today.



   * Frank to participate with Docs Group...

&lt;hr&gt;

*Torre:*

   * Would like to see the menus on the left expanded so one does not have to click to see them.  He would also like a search function.  Fred will address the latter issue with Ruth.  There is a search function enabled on the mambo development site.


   * Reevaluate it after the speed issue is taken care of.

&lt;hr&gt;

   * Lack of information on some of the &quot;PR&quot; pages, ie., the science application pointers, the list of VOs (which currently points to a table that is dull to view).



   * Pass for now. (VOs)
   * Executive committee needs to look at PR pages

&lt;hr&gt;


   * It would be nice if VOs could set up their own areas on the Twiki.  Frank echos this sentiment, and states that LIGO requested a redirect from opensciencegrid.org to their info on their server.


   * Requires new version of TWiki which allows for subwebs and probably additional hardware.
   * When to go to new version of the TWiki.  Need Guidance on whether to update and when.  New Hardware would be needed.
   * IU will do some experimentation to better quantify the issues of upgrading.
&lt;hr&gt;

   * Can we have nicer URLs than the mambo ones?  Kyle says there is a plugin to make this happen, but he was not successful getting it to work on the Fermi server.  He will try again.



   * Will try to make this happen on a test server at IU so we can prepare for it on the new mambo server

&lt;hr&gt;


   * There are links to GridCat -- what is the status?  Frank:  GridCat seems to be transitioning to VORS, however, whatever succeeds GridCAT, it will take some time...



   * Political Implications - VORS Ready by end of week, Will this truly be a replacement for GridCat.  Executive Committee needs to decide how to handle this.

&lt;hr&gt;

   * Monitoring Page:  The list of monitoring tools does not specify which tool is used for what.



   * Monitoring Group needs to decide on a description of each tool and give it to us to use.
&lt;hr&gt;

   * We link to the DOE Grids instructions for getting a certificate, which are very painful.  Doug Olson has a script that runs on Linux that makes it very easy. Fred will email Doug to see if this script could be supported.


   * Fred will handle


&lt;hr&gt;

   * There is a note that DocDB will be moving toward certificate-only authentication  This is not advised.



   * You only need a cert when you want to change or add info...this is a long way off, the advisory has been there for a year.  But it will come into existence at some point.

&lt;hr&gt;


   * Is there a Savannah-type ticketing system?  Fred:  there are some security issues, therefore, a conscious decision was made not to do this.  There is a ticket summary on the Twiki for the Operations Activity.

   * This needs to be discussed for a plan of action...does the EB really want this?  


&lt;hr&gt;

(Torre also sent an email with comments regarding the websites.)


There was agreement by Frank and Torre that using the Twiki to write user documentation and to keep it there would be preferable to moving it to mambo, due to the lack of conversion tools. Kyle:  Twiki in a production state would require a separate Twiki instance, and there is not room on the current machine.  There is no money in the budget to buy a new one.

Fred:  It would be helpful if Frank &amp; Torre would ask the EB to consider having an EB member attend the Docs meeting occasionally; (not every week, but reguarly).  The Docs group frequently needs decisions made or guidance in &quot;herding cats.&quot;
