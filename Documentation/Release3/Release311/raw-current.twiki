---+ OSG Software release 3.1.1

*Release Date*: 03-May-2012

---++ Summary of Changes

There is only one change in this release: due to a critical bug in the globus-gram-job-manager package distributed in release 3.1.0, we are rolling it back to the previous version.
This version is equivalent to upstream version 13.23, which was distributed in release 3.0.9 of the OSG Software stack.


All of the documentation can be found in [[Documentation.Release3][the &quot;Release3&quot;]] area of the Twiki. 

---++ Updating to the new release

If you have an existing installation, you can update to this new release with:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&amp;#61;[package-name or regex]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, rpm does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
