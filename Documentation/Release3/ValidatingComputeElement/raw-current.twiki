---+ About this document
This document will help you validate that your Compute Element is working correctly. 

This document assumes that you have already [[InstallComputeElement][installed and configured your CE]]. For your convenience the sections with validation steps are numbered.

This document follows the general OSG documentation conventions: %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT% showlink=&quot;Click to expand document conventions...&quot;}%

---++ How to get Help?
You can find some suggestions in the [[InstallComputeElement][CE install document]] or in the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationTroubleshootingComputeElement][troubleshooting document]].

To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][Help Procedure]]. 


---+ 1.0 Validate authentication

You should validate that your Compute Element can authenticate users. This will exercise either GUMS or your grid-mapfile (and therefore edg-mkgridmap) and ensure that the authentication and authorization mechanisms work. 

   1. Double-check your configuration to make sure that you are allowed (specifically, your credentials are allowed) to access your CE. You can be either member of a VO allowed to run at the site or you can add your personal certificate locally. This will either be in your GUMS server or in your =edg-mkgridmap= configuration. 
   1. Create a proxy with =voms-proxy-init= or =grid-proxy-init=. For example: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%GLOW%ENDCOLOR%
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Alain Roy 424511
Creating temporary proxy ................................................................................. Done
Contacting  glow-voms.cs.wisc.edu:15001 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=glow-voms.cs.wisc.edu] &quot;GLOW&quot; Done
Creating proxy ..................................................................... Done

Your proxy is valid until Fri Dec  2 01:32:47 2011
&lt;/pre&gt;You&#39;ll substitute your own VO, of course.
   1. Use =globusrun= to ensure that you are authorized. For example: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun -a -r %RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov%ENDCOLOR%

GRAM Authentication test successful
&lt;/pre&gt; You&#39;ll substitute your own hostname, of course.

An example failure that could indicate that you are not in the =grid-mapfile=:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun -a -r %RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov%ENDCOLOR%

GRAM Authentication test failure: authentication with the remote server failed
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example failure that could indicate that you can authenticate and are authorized to run jobs, but your user account on the CE is not correct (among other reasons):
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun -a -r %RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov%ENDCOLOR%

GRAM Authentication test failure: the gatekeeper failed to run the job manager
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+ 2.0 Validate that you can run a job

You should test that you can run a job. 

   1. Create a proxy (see above).
   1. Run a job against your fok job manager. That is, it will run it directly on the CE:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov /bin/hostname%ENDCOLOR%
fermicloud081.fnal.gov
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Submit a job to your batch system. For example, if you have Condor:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov%ENDCOLOR%/jobmanager-%RED%condor%ENDCOLOR% /bin/hostname
fermicloud081.fnal.gov
&lt;/pre&gt;
      * If you are using Torque/PBS, change &quot;condor&quot; to &quot;pbs&quot;
      * If you are using SGE, change &quot;condor&quot; to &quot;sge&quot;
      * If you are using LSF, change &quot;condor&quot; to &quot;lsf&quot;


---+ 3.0 Validate that you can transfer a file

You should test that you can transfer a file to and from your compute element.

   1. Create a proxy (see above).
   1. Copy a file to your CE: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT%  globus-url-copy file:///proc/cpuinfo gsiftp://%RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov%ENDCOLOR%/tmp/cpuinfo-deleteme&lt;/pre&gt;If successful, this will exit silently.
   1. Copy a file from your CE: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy gsiftp://%RED%fermicloud081.fnal.gov%ENDCOLOR%/proc/version file:///tmp/version-deleteme
%UCL_PROMPT% cat /tmp/version-deleteme
Linux version 2.6.18-238.19.1.el5 (gcc version 4.1.2 (Red Hat 4.1.2-50)) #1 SMP Fri Jul 15 00:48:58 EDT 2011
%UCL_PROMPT% rm -f /tmp/version-deleteme&lt;/pre&gt;


---+ 4.0 Validate you accept the correct VOs

When you set up your site, you decide which VOs can access your site. In order to be sure that all of these VOs can access your site, you need to verify that:
   * You have configured the VOs to be allowed
   * All appropriate accounts have been created.
   * All the local storage areas defined for your CE node are accessible by the VO members&#39; accounts.

When you are satisfied that you have met the 3 criteria above, you can be reasonably confident that all VO members you intend to support will be able to access the services provided by your CE node.

The sections below will refer to files that are automatically created by either =edg-mkgridmap= or =gums-host-cron= (depending on your authorization mode). You can run the programs manually:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
&lt;/pre&gt;

or

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/bin/gums-host-cron
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should also ensure that the programs are set to run via cron. Either:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service edg-mkgridmap start
Enabling periodic edg-mkgridmap:                           [ %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

or:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gums-client-cron start
Enabling periodic gums-host-cron:                          [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]
&lt;/pre&gt;



---++ 4.1 Verifying that the appropriate VOs are supported

The =/var/lib/osg/supported-vo-list= (for =edg-mkgridmap=) and =/var/lib/osg/gums-undefined-accounts= (for =GUMS=) files shows the list of OSG VOs to which your site will allow access. If you don&#39;t see a VO in that list, you definitely do not support that VO. If you do see a VO in that list, your site claims to support the VO. If there is a VO in this list, you should either change your configuration (for =edg-mkgridmap= or =GUMS=) so the VO is not supported, or you should make sure you have the appropriate account for each VO.

For comparison, you can look at the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary/index?datasource=summary&amp;summary_attrs_showparent_vo=on&amp;start_type=7daysago&amp;start_date=12%2F01%2F2011&amp;end_type=now&amp;end_date=12%2F01%2F2011&amp;all_vos=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;sort_key=name][complete set of VOs in MyOSG]] to see the full set of VOs that you might support.

---++ 4.2 Verifying that all UNIX accounts are created and accessible

The =/var/lib/osg/undefined-accounts= file shows any accounts are configured for use by incoming VOs, but do not actually exist on your system. If all configured accounts exist, there should be *no* accounts listed and this file  should be empty. If it is not empty, you have a configuration problem that you should fix. 

In addition, you need to verify that the =$HOME= directories for all the accounts are read/write accessible on both the CE and the worker nodes. They should have permissions 755.

---++ 4. 3 Verifying OSG local storage access
The other factor that will affect a VO member&#39;s ability to run successfully on your site is the accessibility to the OSG defined local storage: =$OSG_APP= and (if used) =$OSG_DATA=. Ensure that the directory permissions allow users from each VO to read and write files. You may wish to use the sticky bit to ensure that other users cannot delete each others files.


---+ 5.0 Validate that you are reporting site information correctly

Your site should report site information. Most sites will use CEMon and the GIP to collect and forward data to both the BDII (LDAP server) at the GOC and RESS (Condor collector) at Fermilab. 

Validating that your information is reporting correctly is located in [[TroubleShootingCEMonGIP#ValidateInfo][the CEMon and GIP troubleshooting guide]].

---+ 6.0 Validate accounting (Gratia)

The Gratia probes on your CE report accounting information to OSG. You should verify that Gratia data is being properly reported.

   1. Submit a job to your CE and have it run in your batch system. Allow at least 10 minutes to elapse
   1. Check the [[http://gratia-osg-prod-reports.opensciencegrid.org/gratia-reporting/][Gratia web site]] for your site and make sure jobs are showing up.
   1. If you are still unable to find evidence that your site has reported accounting information, download [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Accounting/TroubleShootingInstructions?filename=gratia-site-diag][&lt;tt&gt;gratia-site-diag&lt;/tt&gt;]] and run it to diagnose possible problems. Report any problems immediately; see [[Accounting.TroubleShootingInstructions][Gratia troubleshooting instructions]] for more details.

---+ 7.0 Validate Managed Fork

   1. Create a proxy (see above).
   1. Submit a simple job to _your_ gatekeeper:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_HOST_FQDN%/jobmanager-fork /bin/sleep 900&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. While the job is running log into your gatekeeper and query Condor:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q -constraint &#39;JobUniverse==12&#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. The command line output should provide a list of all !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationManagedFork jobs that are currently running:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
2784794.0   fnalgrid       10/7  22:19   0+00:00:11 R  0   0.0  sleep 900 
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. If you want to verify that Managed Fork respects the limits that [[InstallComputeElement#4_5_ManagedFork_specific_notes][you set in the configuration]], submit more jobs than the ones allowed and check with =condor_q=, as above, that they remain queued and are not started.

---+ 8.0 Use RSV

RSV is an excellent way to validate your Compute Element. It is a permanent service that performs periodic basic checks of your Compute and Storage Elements. If all RSV tests pass, there is a good chance that your Compute Element is working well. 

RSV is [[RsvOverview][fully described elsewhere]].

---+ References
   * Information about the Compute Element (installation, troubleshooting, ...) is in NavAdminCompute
   * If you want to run the tests from a different machine you&#39;ll need to [[InstallOSGClient][install OSG client]]
   * More tests are detailed in [[TestOSGClient][this document about testing the client and a CE]]
