---++ !ReSSClassadExistsProbe

The !ReSSClassadExistsProbe contacts the !ReSS Collector to check if the given site is advertising to the !ReSS. The default collectors are osg-ress-1.fnal.gov for the production sites and osg-ress-4.fnal.gov for the ITB sites.

OSG CE installation process configures the !CEMon on the CE node to advertise site&#39;s information to the !ReSS Collector and BDII. If the site is well configured, !CEMon will advertise it&#39;s information to the !ReSS. However, there are several things that can go wrong. If your site is not found in !ReSS, follow the troubleshooting instructions at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/ResourceSelection/CEMonTroubleshootingGuide. If you need expert help, please open a GOC ticket describing the issue.
