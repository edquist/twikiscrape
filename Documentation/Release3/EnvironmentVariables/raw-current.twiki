---+ Conventions used in this Document

For variables that are of string type, a  value of =UNAVAILABLE= indicates that the variable is not defined or not applicable. 

---+ Site Related Variables

---+ Storage Related Variables

The storage related variables are defined in more detail within the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][local storage configuration]] document.  The following is a summary, but the Twiki page should be consulted for a definitive view as well as for an explanation for the use cases and which variables must be defined for each use case.

%EDITTABLE{  header=&quot;|*Variable Name*| *Type*|*Definition*|&quot; format=&quot;| text, 20 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x40 |&quot;  changerows=&quot;on&quot; quietsave=&quot;on&quot; editbutton=&quot;Edit table&quot; }%

| OSG_SITE_WRITE | String | Directory available for staging out of files.  Must be writable by all worker nodes. |
--&gt;

---+ Job Manager Variables

These variables are a subset of the site variables that relate to the batch job manager used by the site. Several of the variables will be empty for all sites since a site typically only uses a single job manager to manage jobs.

%EDITTABLE{  header=&quot;|*Variable Name*| *Type*|*Definition*|&quot; format=&quot;| text, 20 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x40 |&quot;  changerows=&quot;on&quot; quietsave=&quot;on&quot; editbutton=&quot;Edit table&quot; }%

| OSG_MANAGEDFORK | Enumerated String [y,n] | Indicates whether Trash.ReleaseDocumentationManagedFork is being used.  If this is the case then =OSG_CONDOR_LOCATION= and =OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG= must be set as well regardless of the value of OSG_JOB_MANAGER |

---+ Monitoring Service Variables

---++ !! !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA

These variables are related to the !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA service and the services that it queries.  These are all deprecated and will not work at most sites

| OSG_GANGLIA_PORT | Integer | The port that ganglia is available at on =OSG_GANGLIA_HOST=  |

---+ Squid Service Variables

These variables provide information about the squid proxy that site may make available.

%EDITTABLE{  header=&quot;|*Variable Name*| *Type*|*Definition*|&quot; format=&quot;| text, 20 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x40 |&quot;  changerows=&quot;on&quot; quietsave=&quot;on&quot; editbutton=&quot;Edit table&quot; }%
| *Variable Name* | *Type* | *Definition* |
| OSG_SQUID_LOCATION | String | The hostname (and optionally port) of the machine that is providing squid proxy services for the site.  This should be set to =UNAVAILABLE= if squid is not provided. E.g. squid.host.name:3128 |
| OSG_SQUID_POLICY | Enumerated String [LRU,LFUDA,GDSF] | The caching policy squid should use for evicting elements from the cache.   *Not currently used* GDSF maximizes the bytes that the proxy caches (i.e. the cache favors large elements over multiple smaller elements) , LFUDA maximizes the number of objects that the proxy caches (i.e. the cache favors multiple smaller elements over large elements), LRU just evicts the least recently used element |
| OSG_SQUID_CACHE_SIZE | integer with optional MB or GB postfixes | The size of the squid disk cache.  The size is assumed to be in megabytes unless a postfix is given. |
| OSG_SQUID_MEM_CACHE | integer with optional MB or GB postfixes | The size of the squid memory cache.  The size is assumed to be in megabytes unless a postfix is given. |

These variables provide information about other services that may be available on the site.

%EDITTABLE{  header=&quot;|*Variable Name*| *Type*|*Definition*|&quot; format=&quot;| text, 20 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x40 |&quot;  changerows=&quot;on&quot; quietsave=&quot;on&quot; editbutton=&quot;Edit table&quot; }%
|*Variable Name*|*Type*|*Definition*|
| OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION | String | The path to the GLEXEC binaries on the worker nodes.  This is set to =UNAVAILABLE= if GLEXEC is not installed. |
