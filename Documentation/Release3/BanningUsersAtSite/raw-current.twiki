---++ About This Document
This document describes the different methods of how to ban users in OSG whether sites are using GUMS or gridmap files for authorization.

---++ Sites using GUMS 1.3
   * Go to the GUMS web interface
      * https://gums-host:8443/gums/
   * Add new  manual group called banned
      * Configuration -&gt; User Groups -&gt; Add

     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/UserGroupAdd.png&quot; alt=&quot;UserGroupAdd.png&quot; width=&#39;700&#39; height=&#39;750&#39; /&gt;    

      * Select type = manual and provide name, description. Then save

    &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/BannedGroupAdd.png&quot; alt=&quot;BannedGroupAdd.png&quot; width=&#39;733&#39; height=&#39;304&#39; /&gt;    

   * Add this group to a “banned user group”
      * Click on Configuration 
      * Select the group from drop down menu and save

    &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/ConfigBannedGroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;ConfigBannedGroup.png&quot; width=&#39;700&#39; height=&#39;300&#39; /&gt;    


   * Add user FQAN to the banned group
      * Click on “Manual User Group Members” in “User Management” section
      * Click Add, select the appropriate “user group”
      * Add the user FQAN and save
       %IMPORTANT% We have noticed that just banning DNs instead of FQANs does not work. So please remember to ban FQAN.

    &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/AddDNBannedGroup.png&quot; alt=&quot;AddDNBannedGroup.png&quot; width=&#39;700&#39; height=&#39;300&#39; /&gt;    

---+++ Test if Banning is successfully applied
   * Test the mapping from your CE (as su)
&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% gums-host mapUser %RED%&quot;DN&quot;%ENDCOLOR% 
null
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Only if the mapping returns null, the user is banned

---++ Sites using GUMS 1.2
   * No banning option is available directly in GUMS 1.2.x.
   * To ban users an upgrade to 1.3.x is required

---++ Sites using edg-mkgridmap
   * Update /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf [NOTE: Old Location is edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf (in $VDT_LOCATION)]
      * Add a line &#39;deny “DN”&#39;  
      * Wild cards are also accepted
      * Regenerate grid-mapfile executing  /usr/sbin/edg-mkgridmap [Old: edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap]
      * Log file can be generally found at /var/log/edg-mkgridmap.log [Old: edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log]
   * Check your grid-mapfile and confirm that the DN has indeed been removed
