---+ About this Document
This is a navigation page introducing the &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;irtual &lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rganization &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;embership &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ystem (VOMS) and the related documents.

---+ Introduction
%LINK_GLOSSARY_VO%s are used to delegate user management on OSG:
   * VOs decide who is a memeber and classify their members
   * resources, e.g.  %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%s and %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%s, decide which privileges to grant to a VO or to a subset (e.g. a group) of a VO

%INCLUDE{&quot;InstallVoms&quot; section=&quot;VomsDefinition&quot;}%

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GUMS% or similar technologies are used by grid resources to interact with VOMS.

Each VO in OSG should have a VOMS server.
If a VO is not using VOMS or a certificate is not registered in VOMS, all grid resources would have to add in a local file the certificate in question or all the certificates belonging to the VO.
This can be done to test a resource or for few special certificates, but becomes unmanageable on a large scale.
