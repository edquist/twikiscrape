%TOC{depth=&quot;2&quot;}%
%NOTE% The following sections are intended to be a super set for a Troubleshooting Document.  Particular sections may not apply to all documents, but use all the sections that make sense for your document.
%NOTE% Items in common with many troubleshooting documents should have their own page and be pointed to by or included in this document.
%NOTE% Create a new Troubleshooting document if some software or operational change requires more than a few changes to this procedure and the old troubleshooting procedure still needs to be available for use.

---++ About This Document
Note the intended user of this document

Include a brief description of troubleshooting procedure, what it applies to, and how this fits into any larger process.

---++ Common Problems
List or describe the most common problems or errors that occur that would have caused the reader to be using this document.
For example:
   1. Do you have a valid proxy? (And explain how to check.)
   1. Have you typed commands correctly?
   1. Are you using the right directory? (And explain what is the right directory.)
   1. Do you have access to the service?  (And explain how can I test for access.)
   1. Are you authorized to use the service?  (And explain how do I verify I have authorization.)
   1. Etc.

---++ Troubleshooting Procedure
Begin with a high level list of the steps involved in this troubleshooting procedure

Continue with a more detailed description of the steps the reader should take in order to eliminate possible problem areas and identify the area that is causing the the problem.   
For each step, you should have what to do, what you should expect to see, and what to do if you don&#39;t get the expected response.
Each step that requires unix commands should show the commands in a green box using 
&lt;verbatim&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
% command parameters
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/verbatim&gt; tag which will look like this.
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
% command parameters
&lt;/pre&gt;
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $OSG_RELEASE) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction should be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines, especially if you are showing just a few commands.  If you copy and paste a terminal session with intermixed commands and output, use a simple prompt string (like %) that makes it clear which are commands and what is output.

---++ If You Need Help
This should cover things the reader should do in order to get help from experts.

---+++ What information an expert will need
Identify information that anyone assisting with this problem will need and where or how the reader can get that information.
