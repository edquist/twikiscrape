---+ Developing !RSV Probes

%TOC%


---++ Introduction
The objective of this page is to help members of the OSG community (system administrators, VO admins, users, etc.) to develop their own !RSV probes using the provided !RSV probe infrastructure.  These probes can be tailored to the user&#39;s needs.  Writing your own probe is almost as simple as writing a script that does the test from the command line.  

There are 3 steps to writing your probe:
   1 [[WriteProbe][Write the probe]]
   1 [[InstallProbe][Install the probe into !RSV]]
   1 [[TestProbe][Test the probe]]

If you would like to add your probe to the RSV distribution contact the VDT team once it is ready to be released.  We will merge it into the next ITB release for testing.
