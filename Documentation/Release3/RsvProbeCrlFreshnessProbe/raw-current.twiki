---+ About this Document
This document is about the a RSV probe included in the default distribution. 
You need a host with RSV installed according to [[InstallRSV]]. The same document instructs on [[InstallRSV#Configuration][how to configure RSV]] and [[InstallRSV#Troubleshooting][&lt;b&gt;how to troubleshoot framework errors&lt;/b&gt;]].

---+ Description

This probe checks the CRLs on the host where it runs (this new python probe runs the same tests as the old perl probe):
   * downloads a file contains a list of md5sum from a central location.
   * this list is compared against the md5sum of the files in the site CA install.
   * additionally it makes sure that all IGTF CAs are installed.
   * warnings become critical errors after some hours (option --error-hours 72 as default)
Certificates not included in the GOC list are not verified.
Expiration date and validity are not checked.

This probe can run locally on the RSV host or on remote servers (e.g. CEs, SEs,...)

| *Metric* | *Test description* |
| org.osg.certificates.crl-expiry | Test if the Certificates Revocation Lists (CRLs) have been updated recently |

---+ Manual invocation
This probe can be invoked manually.
It requires:
  * =rsvprobe.py=, providing the base class in Python for RSV Probes, in the PYTHONPATH or in the current directory  
  * optionally =timed_command.py= to be able to enforce timeouts

It accepts the following additional options:
| *Option* | *Description* |
| --error-file FILE_LOCATION | Location where errors should be recorded |
| --warning-hours HOURS | Number of hours elapsed before a warning is to be issued |
| --error-hours HOURS | Number of hours elapsed before error is to be issued |
| --type TYPE | This parameter determines whether the test should confrom to EGEE or OSG requirement. (Accepted values: osg, egee) (Default: osg) |
| --cacerts-dir DIR | Location of CA certificate files (Default: /etc/grid-security/certificates) |


To invoke manually: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ .# ./crl-freshness-probe
RSV BRIEF RESULTS:
UNKNOWN
UNKNOWN: ERROR: CA Certs Directory /etc/grid-security/certificates contains no CRL files (*.r0). Aborting the probe (UNKOWN status).
&lt;/pre&gt;


---+ Provided metrics
The remainder of this page is dedicated to explaining the failure modes of the this probe, and how you might try to resolve them.

---++ Metric  org.osg.certificates.crl-expiry
Checks the CRLs on the host where it runs (this new python probe runs the same tests as the old perl probe):
   * downloads a file contains a list of md5sum from a central location.
   * this list is compared against the md5sum of the files in the site CA install.
   * additionally it makes sure that all IGTF CAs are installed.
   * warnings become critical errors after some hours (option --error-hours 72 as default)
Certificates not included in the GOC list are not verified.
Expiration date and validity are not checked.

Failure modes of this metric:
   * *CRITICAL*: one of the following occurred more than _error_hours_ (72) hours from the check:
      * CRL is missing when certificate is present
      * CRL file has not been updated for more than _warning_hours_ (3) hours 
   * *UNKNOWN*: 
      * invalid parameter (test type not in list, error hours not integer)
      * cannot find certificate directory or it contains no CRL certificates
      * cert dir has unknown certificates type
      * could not download the CA list from OSG or the file is empty
   * *WARNING*: one of the following occurred less than _error_hours_ (72) hours from the check:
      * CRL is missing when certificate is present
      * CRL file has not been updated for more than _warning_hours_ (3) hours 
      * Problems recording the error_file or wrong error_file format (probe may never escalate to error)
