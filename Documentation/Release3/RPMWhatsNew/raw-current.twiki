---+ About this Document
This document is for System Administrators. It explains best practices on how to upgrade from OSG 1.2, Pacman based releases, to OSG 3.0, based on RPMs.

---+ What&#39;s different about the OSG 3 RPM-based OSG Software Stack?

%STARTSECTION{&quot;WhatIsDifferent&quot;}%
Here are some key items to note about this release, specially if you are familiar with previous OSG Pacman installations:
   * The former Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) is now referred as part of the OSG Software Stack.
   * We have moved from Globus 4.0.8 to Globus 5.2. Globus 5.2 does not includes web-services GRAM (aka GRAM 4). GRAM from 5.2 should be compatible with the pre-web services GRAM from Globus 4.0.8.
   * If you use GUMS, you must make sure that you use version 1.3.x or later. This is because our authorization framework has been changed (we now use lcmaps instead of PRIMA), and it only uses the newer XACML protocol instead of the old SAML protocol. GUMS 1.2.x and earlier did not provide the XACML protocol.
   * Most component have been packaged as RPM. Read YumRpmBasics, YumRepositories and InstallBestPractices if you are not familiar with RPMs and Yum repositories.
   * Some components are not yet packaged as RPMs and you still need to get them from existing Pacman installs. In particular, GUMS and the Gratia Collector are not yet provided via RPM.
   * Files are installed in standard locations such as =/usr/bin= and =/etc=. Some implications of this:
      * =$VDT_LOCATION= no longer exists
      * =$VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh= no longer exists and isn&#39;t needed. For user jobs that still expect =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= to exist, a dummy has been placed in =/etc/osg/wn-client/setup.sh=, and you can set =$OSG_GRID= to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.
      * =$GLOBUS_LOCATION= no longer exists
      * Pacman installations could be easily shared by exporting the install directory. This is not possible for OSG 3 RPMs because files are sparse in different places in the file system.
      * binaries are in the system/user PATH
      * libraries may replace or upgrade installed ones and be used by other programs
      * the installation may create users or modify files
      * uninstalling the packages is more tricky
      * it is not possible to install multiple versions at the same time
   * Related, the recommended method for installing a worker node is to no longer install it on a shared filesystem, but to install it via RPMs on each node. While this is a better approach, when you install or upgrade hundreds or thousands of nodes at your site, you will potentially overload our software repository. We recommend mirroring our software repository ([[InstallBestPractices#Repository_Mirrors][instructions]]) or using a Squid proxy to lessen the load on our server.
   * The single =config.ini= file has been replaced by a directory of files in =/etc/osg/*.ini=. They are read in alphabetical order.
   * =configure-osg= has been renamed =osg-configure=.
