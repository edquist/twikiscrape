---+!! Installing GSI !OpenSSH

---+ About This Document

This document gives instructions on installing and using the GSI !OpenSSH server available in the OSG repository and configuring it so that you can use on your cluster.
 

---+ Engineering Considerations

---+ Requirements
---++ Host and OS
The GSI !OpenSSH rpms will require an user account and group in order for the privilege separation to work.  

---++ Users and Groups
The RPM installation will try to create the =gsisshd= user and group and the =/var/empty/gsisshd= directory with the correct ownership if they are not present.  If you are using a configuration management system or ROCKS, you should make sure that these users and groups are created before installing the RPMs to avoid potential issues.  The gsisshd user should have an empty home directory.  By default, this is home directory set to  =/var/empty/gsisshd=  and belongs to the =gsisshd= user and group.  You may change it if needed to something else as long as the ownerships remain the same.

---++ GSI !OpenSSH Installation
 Start with installing GSI !OpenSSH from the repository
&lt;pre  class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install gsi-openssh-server gsi-openssh-clients
&lt;/pre&gt;


In addition, you&#39;ll need to install CA certificates in order for !GSIOpenSSH to work.  You can follow the instructions below in order to install them:

---+ Configuration and Operations

#ImportantFiles
---++ Useful configuration and log files

Configuration Files
| *Service or Process* | *Configuration File* | *Description* |
| gsisshd | =/etc/gsissh/sshd_config= | Configuration file |
| gsisshd | =/etc/sysconfig/gsisshd= | Environment variables for gsisshd |
| gsisshd | =/etc/lcmaps.db= | LCMAPS configuration |

Log Files
| *Service or Process* | *Log File* | *Description* |
| gsisshd | =/var/log/messages= | All log messages |

Other Files
| *Service or Process* | *File* | *Description* |
| gsisshd | =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= | Host certificate |
| gsisshd | =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= | Key certificate |
| gsisshd | =/etc/gsissh/ssh_host_rsa_key= | RSA Host key | 
| gsisshd | =/etc/gsissh/ssh_host_dsa_key= | DSA Host key |


---++ Configuration
In order to get a running instance of the GSI !OpenSSH server, you&#39;ll need to change the default configuration.  However, before you go any further, you&#39;ll need to decide whether you want GSI !OpenSSH to be your primary ssh service or not (e.g. whether the GSI !OpenSSH service will replace your existing SSH service).  If you choose not to replace your existing service, you&#39;ll need to change the port setting in the GSI !OpenSSH configuration to another port (e.g. 2222) so that you can run both SSH services at the same time.  Regardless of your choice, you should probably have both services use the same host key.  In order to do this, symlink =/etc/gsissh/ssh_host_dsa_key= and =/etc/gsissh/ssh_host_rsa_key= to =/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key= and =/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key=  respectively. 
%NOTE% Regardless of the authorization method used for the user,  any account that will be used with GSI !OpenSSH must have a shell assigned to it and not be locked (have !! in the password field of =/etc/shadow=).

---++ Using a gridmap file for authorization
In order to use , you&#39;ll need to create mappings in your =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= for the DNs that you will allow to login.  The mappings should be entered one to a line, with each line consisting of DN followed by the account the DN should map to.  Also, you should ensure that the =/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf= file is empty or that all of the lines in the file are commented out using a =#= at the beginning of the line.

%NOTE% The mappings will not consider VOMS extensions so the first mapping that matches will be used regardless of the VO role or VO present in the users proxy

An example of the =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= follows:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
&quot;/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=USER NAME 123456&quot; useraccount
&lt;/pre&gt;
---++ Using LCMAPS and GUMS for authorization
In order to use LCMAPS callouts with GSI !OpenSSH, you&#39;ll first need to edit =/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf= to indicate that Globus should do a GSI callout for authorization.  The file should contain the following:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
globus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout
&lt;/pre&gt;
so that LCMAPS is used.  Next, install the lcmaps rpms:
&lt;pre  class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install lcmaps lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface
&lt;/pre&gt;
Finally, you&#39;ll need to modify  =/etc/lcmaps.db= so that the =gumsclient= entry has the correct endpoint for your gums server.



---++ Starting and Enabling Services
To start the services:
   1. To start GSI !OpenSSH you can use the service command, e.g.: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gsisshd start
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on: 
   * To enable !OpenSSH by default on the node: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig gsisshd on
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Stopping and Disabling Services
To stop the services:
   1. To stop !OpenSSH you can use: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gsisshd stop
&lt;/pre&gt;

In addition, you can disable services by running the following commands.  However, you don&#39;t need to do this normally.
   * Optionally, to disable !OpenSSH: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig gsisshd off
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+ Troubleshooting
You can get information on troubleshooting errors on the [[http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/ssh/ts_server.html][NCSA page]].

To troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to =/etc/sysconfig/gsisshd= and choose a higher debug level:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,
#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug
LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output goes to =/var/log/messages= by default.

---++ Test GSI !OpenSSH

After starting the =gsisshd= service you can check if it is running correctly&lt;pre  class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% grid-proxy-init
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=User Name
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy .................................................................. Done
%UCL_PROMPT% gsissh localhost -p 2222
Last login: Tue Sep 18 16:08:03 2012 from itb4.uchicago.edu
%UCL_PROMPT%  &lt;/pre&gt;
