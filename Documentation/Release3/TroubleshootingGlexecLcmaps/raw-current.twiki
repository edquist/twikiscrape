---# Glexec: The big picture

---## What software is used?

While we casually refer to glexec, you need to be aware of three different pieces:

   1. *glexec:* Glexec is a program that you can think of a &quot;[[http://www.globus.org/security/overview.html][GSI]] sudo&quot;. It will run a program as another user, but first it will authenticate and authorize the submitting user based on their X.509 credential. 
   1. *lcmaps*: lcmaps is a framework for authorizing a user and mapping their X.509 credential to a local user name. Glexec doesn&#39;t perform authorization itself, but instead uses lcmaps.
   1. *lcmaps plugins*: By itself, lcmaps does very little. Instead it relies on a set of plugins to do all of the work. You need to be aware of these plugins because they show up in the lcmaps configuration. When people refer to &quot;lcmaps&quot;, they really mean &quot;lcmaps plus plugins&quot;. 

---## Configuring policies

Lcmaps can be used by different pieces of software. In OSG, we currently (mid 2012) use lcmaps not only for glexec but also for [[http://www.globus.org/grid_software/computation/gram.php][Globus GRAM]] (for a Compute Element Gatekeeper) and !GridFTP (for a Storage Element) when we use GUMS. (Normally GRAM and !GridFTP don&#39;t bother with lcmaps when using a grid-mapfile, though they could.) Because lcmaps can be used in different contexts, the =/etc/lcmaps.db= file describes how to use lcmaps in each of those contexts. On a single machine, you probably only use it one way, but our default configuration file is set up for all our possible uses. 

The =/etc/lcmaps.db= file is broken into two sections:

   1. Information about each of the plugins. Normally you don&#39;t need to edit these except to set the GUMS hostname and to enable the glexectracking plugin. (It&#39;s disabled by default because it won&#39;t be installed when using lcmaps with just Globus and not glexec)
   1. Policies. Our default configuration ships with two policies:
      1. authorize_only: Used by Globus-based services.
      1. glexec: Used by glexec. The details of the policy are uncommented because you have to make choices when you install it.

---# Common Glexec problems

You can try out glexec with something like the following:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%yourvo%ENDCOLOR%:/%RED%yourvo%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT=/tmp/x509up_u%RED%NNN%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
&lt;/pre&gt;

If your lcmaps.db is set up to not use a host certificate as described in GlexecPilotCert, you should also set
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% export X509_USER_PROXY=tmp/x509up_u%RED%NNN%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;
before running glexec.

---## Didn&#39;t enable glexec policy

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
[gLExec]:  LCMAPS failed.
           The reason can be found in the syslog.
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
203
&lt;/pre&gt;

The lcmaps error in =/var/log/messages= indicates a configuration problem:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
May 23 08:20:09 fermicloud037 glexec[2823]: Trying to read /etc/glexec.conf as 13975(glexec)/9815(glexec) 
May 23 08:20:09 fermicloud037 glexec[2823]: lcmaps: /etc/lcmaps.db:158: [warning] expecting rule definitions. 
May 23 08:20:09 fermicloud037 glexec[2823]: %RED%lcmaps: /etc/lcmaps.db:158: [warning] no rules specified for policy: &#39;glexec&#39; at line 141.%ENDCOLOR%
May 23 08:20:09 fermicloud037 glexec[2823]: lcmaps: LCMAPS failed to do mapping and return account information 
May 23 08:20:09 fermicloud037 glexec[2823]:   LCMAPS failed. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

This probably indicates the you didn&#39;t edit =/etc/lcmaps.db= after installing. By default, that file does not have a policy enabled: you have to select one by uncommenting it in the file. The glexec policy portion of the =lcmaps.db= file looks like this when it&#39;s installed: note that all the lines begin with a #, indicating that they are commented out:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# Mapping policy: glexec
# Purpose:        Used for glexec on the worker nodes.
#
glexec:

## If you use glexec, pick an appropriate policy from the ones below.
## Make sure that only one policy is uncommented.

## Policy 1: GUMS but not SAZ (most common)
#verifyproxy -&gt; gumsclient
#gumsclient -&gt; glexectracking

## Policy 2: GUMS &amp; SAZ
#verifyproxy -&gt; sazclient
#sazclient -&gt; gumsclient
#gumsclient -&gt; glexectracking

## Policy 3: grid-mapfile
#verifyproxy -&gt; gridmapfile
#gridmapfile -&gt; glexectracking
&lt;/pre&gt;

Most people will select the first policy. If you do, it will look like this:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# Mapping policy: glexec
# Purpose:        Used for glexec on the worker nodes.
#
glexec:
verifyproxy -&gt; gumsclient
gumsclient -&gt; glexectracking
&lt;/pre&gt;

---## Didn&#39;t enable glexectracking

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
%RED%NO OUTPUT%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT%  echo $?
202
&lt;/pre&gt;

The lcmaps error in =/var/log/messages= indicates a configuration problem:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
May 23 08:21:40 fermicloud037 glexec[2844]: Trying to read /etc/glexec.conf as 13975(glexec)/9815(glexec) 
May 23 08:21:40 fermicloud037 glexec[2844]: %RED%lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-PluginInit(): plugin glexectracking not found (arguments: )%ENDCOLOR%
May 23 08:21:40 fermicloud037 glexec[2844]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-lcmaps_startPluginManager(): error initializing plugin: glexectracking 
May 23 08:21:40 fermicloud037 glexec[2844]: lcmaps: lcmaps_init() error: could not start plugin manager 
May 23 08:21:40 fermicloud037 glexec[2844]:   Initialisation of LCMAPS failed. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

You probably requested the use of the glexec tracking plugin in =/etc/lcmaps.db=, since that&#39;s what we recommend:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
glexec:
verifyproxy -&gt; gumsclient
gumsclient -&gt; %RED%glexectracking%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

But you probably didn&#39;t uncomment glexectracking in =/etc/lcmaps.db= to tell lcmaps where to find it. 
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# Uncomment the first two lines in order to enable glexec tracking
%RED%#%ENDCOLOR%glexectracking = &quot;lcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod&quot;
%RED%#%ENDCOLOR%         &quot;-exec /usr/sbin/glexec_monitor&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just remove those hash marks to enable glexectracking:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
# Uncomment the first two lines in order to enable glexec tracking
glexectracking = &quot;lcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod&quot;
         &quot;-exec /usr/sbin/glexec_monitor&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---## User doesn&#39;t exist

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
[gLExec]:  LCMAPS failed.
           The reason can be found in the syslog.
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
203
&lt;/pre&gt;

The lcmaps error in =/var/log/messages= indicates the user doesn&#39;t exist:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
May 23 08:22:46 fermicloud037 glexec[2860]: Trying to read /etc/glexec.conf as 13975(glexec)/9815(glexec) 
May 23 08:22:46 fermicloud037 glexec[2860]: %RED%lcmaps: Username_handler: Error: Couldn&#39;t find the username &#39;engage&#39; in the password file.%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make the user account to fix this problem.

---## The user doesn&#39;t have a proxy

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
[gLExec]:  Failed to open $GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT=/tmp/x509up_u11500 or $GLEXEC_SOURCE_PROXY=(NULL).
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
201
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make a proxy with =voms-proxy-init= to solve this problem.

---## User isn&#39;t authorized

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
[gLExec]:  LCMAPS failed.
           The reason can be found in the syslog.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The lcmaps error in =/var/log/messages= indicates the user isn&#39;t authorized by your GUMS server:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
May 23 08:55:05 fermicloud037 glexec[5981]: %RED%lcmaps: LCMAPS failed to do mapping and return account information%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---## Missing hostkey

glexec requires a host certificate on each worker node in order to talk to GUMS. When you don&#39;t have a hostcert, you get an error message like this in =/var/log/messages=

(output was word-wrapped for clarity)

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
May 23 08:36:55 fermicloud037 glexec[3097]: Syslog has been reopened with new facility &#39;LOG_LOCAL1&#39; 
May 23 08:36:55 fermicloud037 glexec[3097]: %RED%lcmaps: setup_client_ctx: Error loading private key from file: &#39;/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem&#39;. 
    OpenSSL reason: No such file or directory.%ENDCOLOR%

May 23 08:36:55 fermicloud037 glexec[3097]: lcmaps: ssl_io_connect(): Failure in SSL layer setup and connection! 
&lt;/pre&gt;

---## Can&#39;t connect to GUMS server

Here&#39;s an example error from =/var/log/messages= when you can&#39;t connect to the GUMS server. Make sure that you&#39;ve used the proper hostname for the GUMS server in =/etc/lcmaps.db= and the GUMS server is running. 

(output was word-wrapped for clarity)

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
May 23 08:38:22 fermicloud037 glexec[3121]: lcmaps: post_connection_check: Error: found one or more DNS entries in the subjectAltName but none match the host &#39;cloudgums1.fnal.gov&#39;. 
May 23 08:38:22 fermicloud037 glexec[3121]: lcmaps: ssl_io_connect(): Error with peer certificate after the full handshake: application verification failure

&lt;/pre&gt;


---## A successful authorization

When glexec works, it will look something like this:

(output was word-wrapped for clarity)

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;

---## Other possible problems. 

If you have upgraded glexec with yum, you might need to merge changes from your old configuration file into the new configuration file. 

| Existing, old configuration file: | =/etc/glexec.conf= |
| New configuration file template: | =/etc/glexec.conf.rpmnew= |

Similarly, if you have upgraded lcmaps with yum, you might need to merge changes from your old configuration file into the new configuration file. 

| Existing, old configuration file: | =/etc/lcmaps.db= |
| New configuration file template: | =/etc/lcmaps.db.rpmnew= |

Check to make sure that you are running a recent version of glexec and lcmaps.
