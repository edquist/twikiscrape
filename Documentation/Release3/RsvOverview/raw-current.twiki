---+ About this document
This is documentation for !RSV for !OSG 3.  !RSV documentation for OSG 1.0 and 1.2 is available [[Trash/Trash/MonitoringInformation/RSV][here]].

---+ RSV Description
---++ RSV Concepts
The Resource and Service Validation (!RSV) software provides a scalable and easy to maintain resource/service monitoring infrastructure for an OSG site admin. 
   * [[RsvPrinciples][RSV Principles]]
   * [[RsvArchitecture][RSV Architecture]]

---++ RSV Service Components
The components of !RSV are:
   * &lt;strong&gt;RSV Client:&lt;/strong&gt; The client allows OSG site administrators to run tests against their CEs/SEs.  This provides a set of metrics to test the resource, Condor-Cron for scheduling,  and a Gratia infrastructure for collecting and storing the results.
      * The !RSV Client runs metrics at scheduled time intervals.  It produces a simple webpage of local !RSV results for a site administrator&#39;s viewing.  It also has the capability to upload those probe results to a central collector (addressed next).
   * &lt;strong&gt;RSV Collector/Server:&lt;/strong&gt; The server collects results from any number of !RSV clients and stores them in a database. You can view these central results on [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/rgcurrentstatus/index?datasource=currentstatus&amp;summary_attrs_showservice=on&amp;summary_attrs_showrsvstatus=on&amp;summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&amp;downtime_attrs_showpast=&amp;account_type=cumulative_hours&amp;ce_account_type=gip_vo&amp;se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&amp;start_type=7daysago&amp;start_date=12/25/2009&amp;end_type=now&amp;end_date=12/25/2009&amp;all_resources=on&amp;gridtype=on&amp;gridtype_1=on&amp;service_central_value=0&amp;service_hidden_value=0&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;disable_value=1][the !MyOSG-based !RSV current status page]].  Other !RSV-based choices are available in the &lt;em&gt;Resource Group menu&lt;/em&gt; within !MyOSG.
   * &lt;strong&gt;Periodic Availability Reports:&lt;/strong&gt; The availability of all active registered OSG resources and the services running on each of those resources is calculated using the results received for [[Operations.RsvEquivalency#Critical_Tests_for_OSG_Resources][critical metrics]]. Once a day, these availability numbers are &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports&quot;&gt;published online&lt;/a&gt; and via email [[Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics.RsvReportsOverview][as explained here]].  (More information: [[Operations.RSVPeriodicReporting][Outline of reports]],     [[Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics.RsvReports][Installation guide for GOC staff]]).
   * &lt;strong&gt;RSV-SAM Transport:&lt;/strong&gt; The WLCG !RSV-SAM Transport infrastructure pushes out !RSV results (for resources that are flagged to be part of the WLCG Interoperability agreement) from the GOC collector to WLCG&#39;s Service Availability Monitoring (SAM) system. More information on [[Operations.RsvSAMGridView][viewing these results is available here]].
      * &lt;strong&gt;MyOSG and OIM Links: &lt;/strong&gt; RSV picks up resource information, WLCG interoperability information, etc. from a !MyOSG resource group summary listing, which is in turn based on the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OSG Information Management (OIM) (topology) system]] (Requires registration).  Resource [[Operations.OIMMaintTool][maintenance scheduled on OIM]], are forwarded to WLCG SAM, if applicable.
