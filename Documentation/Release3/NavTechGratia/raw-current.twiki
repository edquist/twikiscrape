---+!! Gratia
Gratia is used for accounting of jobs and data transfers in OSG. There are individual _Gratia probes_ at sites that collect data as well as _Gratia services_ that collect data. The data is sent to a _Gratia service_ (aka _Collector_), by default to the central Gratia service maintained by OSG, but
other local Gratia services can be installed, receive the data and optionally forward it also to the central one.

The information stored in Gratia can be accessed using web clients like the the [[http://display.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Display]] or [[http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/][Gratia-Webtool]]. Otherwise you can subscribe to the regular [[Accounting.ReportsDescription][Email reports]].

   * If you are interested in *browsing the data* stored in Gratia, please check the links in in the previous paragraph or contact [[mailto:osg-accounting@opensciencegrid.org][Gratia oprerations]] if you have special needs.
   * If you are *installing/configuring Gratia probes or Gratia services*, please check the _Sysadmin Documents_ below for the components of your interest
   * If you are developing a probe or Gratia services then you may be interested in reading most of this document and the linked ones.

---+ Sysadmin Documents
This section gives a description of the Gratia system and presents documents to install, configure and troubleshoot components of the Gratia system.

---++ Gratia Probes
Currently, there are 15 probes that can report to Gratia. The probes could be subdivided into several major categories:
   1. __Local Batch System probe__. A probe specific to  to the type of site&#39;s batch system is running at each grid site. It collects information about finished jobs. Condor, Torque(PBS), LSF, SGE and Slurm Batch Systems are supported. The probes are installed with installation of a Compute Element.
   1. __Transfer Probes__. A probe collects information about the file transfers from/to Storage installed at each grid site. !GridFTP, !dCache, xrootd, hadoop transfer probes are supported. A probe is installed with installation of a Storage Element.
   1. __Storage Probes__.A probe gathers information about physical and logical pools utilization of a Storage installed at each grid site.   dCache, xrootd, hadoop storage probe are supported. A probe is installed with installation of a Storage Element.
   1. __Worker Node Probes__.The probes that  may be installed on a worker node are ps-acctounting probe and glexec probes. ps-accounting probe collects unix accounting information about finished processes ran by user. Glexec probe reports information about identity  of the user running jobs via glidein pilot. More information about glexec could be found [[InstallGlexec][here]].

Installation, setup and troubleshooting of the Gratia probes
   * The [[Documentation/Release3.InstallComputeElement][Compute Element install document]] will tell you also how to install its Gratia probes (for HTCondor, PBS, LSF, RSV, ...), mostly using =osg-configure= that simplifies the configuration.
   * Similarly install documents of Storage Elements describe also probes installation and configuration.
   * [[Accounting.ProbeConfigGlideinWMS][Gratia probe for HTCondor]]. Pay attention to [[Accounting.ProbeConfigGlideinWMS#Users_without_Certificates][this section]] if you are in a Campus Grid or any setup where x509 authentication (Grid certificates for users) is NOT used.
