---++ RSV Code Repository Access

The !RSV source code is kept in a Subversion source code repository hosted by the VDT. You can find it at:

=https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/rsv=

Everyone has read-only access. If you are developing or maintaining RSV probes that need to be part of the RSV distribution, you should contact the VDT team to request write-access to the repository. 

Currently, access is provided with a username/password. We haven&#39;t yet set up X509 access. 

There are two steps to get access:

*Please note:* it will be simplest for you if the user name is the same as your local user name on the system from which you&#39;ll be accessing the Subversion repository. 

   1. Generate a password for yourself by running the following command:&lt;br&gt;&lt;verbatim&gt;htpasswd -c passwd.file SOMEUSER&lt;/verbatim&gt;
   1. Mail =passwd.file= to vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org with a request for access.
