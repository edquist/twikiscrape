---# About this Document

Here we describe the OSG Upcoming Software Repositories, their purpose, and how to use them.

This document is intended for site administrators.

---# Overview and Purpose

Certain sites have requested new versions of software that would be considered &quot;disruptive&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot; -- upgrading to them would likely require manual intervention before the site would come back up.
We do not want sites to unwittingly upgrade to these versions.
For the benefit of the sites that do want to upgrade, we want to provide the same assurance of quality and production-readiness that we provide to the software we currently ship now.

Due to the relatively small number of such packages, a full fork of the OSG 3 distribution was not warranted.
Instead, we have created a separate set of repositories that contain only the &quot;disruptive&quot; versions of the software. These repositories have the same structure as our standard repositories.
For example, there is an =osg-upcoming-testing= repository and an =osg-upcoming= repository.

A full installation of our software stack is _not_ possible using only the =osg-upcoming= repositories, since they contain a small subset of the software we ship. Both the main =osg= and the =osg-upcoming= repositories will need to be enabled for the installation to work. Thus, interoperability will be maintained between the main =osg= and =osg-upcoming= repositories.

Depending on test results from sites, some packages in =osg-upcoming= may eventually end up in the main =osg= branch. The rest of the packages will eventually form the nucleus of the next fork of the software stack (e.g. &quot;OSG 3.2&quot; if the current release were &quot;OSG 3.1&quot;).

---# Installation and Usage

To install software from the Upcoming repositories, you must:

   1. Install or update the OSG yum repository definitions
   1. Enable one or more Upcoming repositories, either temporarily for one command or persistently for many commands

%INCLUDE{&quot;YumRepositories&quot; section=&quot;OSGRepoBrief&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;+&quot;}%

---## Enabling Upcoming Repositories for a Single Command

By default, *ALL* of the Upcoming repositories are disabled, which means that =yum= commands do not use the Upcoming repositories for installs, updates, etc. This section describes how to enable one or more Upcoming repositories for a single =yum= command.

The =yum= command supports command-line options to enable repositories that are otherwise normally disabled. The general form of a =yum= command, with extra enabled repositories, is:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=REPONAME ... COMMAND ...&lt;/pre&gt;

The =--enablerepo= option may be specified more than once, in which case all named repositories are enabled for the duration of the given =COMMAND=.

The =REPONAME= value is the name of the repository to be enabled. The names of the most important OSG Upcoming repositories are:

   * =osg-upcoming= for software that is ready for production
   * =osg-upcoming-testing= for software that is being tested

For example, to install the =osg-ce= package, using any packages from the production-ready Upcoming repository, use the following command:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-upcoming install osg-ce&lt;/pre&gt;

---## Enabling Upcoming Repositories for Persistent Use

Although the Upcoming repositories are disabled by default, you can change the yum configuration to enable one or more Upcoming repositories persistently, so that all future =yum= commands will use the enabled repositories.

In the =/etc/yum.repos.d= directory, there should be a file called =osg-upcoming.repo= (el5) or =osg-el6-upcoming.repo= (el6) (if not, please review the instructions above for installing and updating the OSG yum repository definitions). Edit the file and change &lt;code&gt;enabled=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;enabled=1&lt;/code&gt; under the =[osg-upcoming]= section. This will enable the production upcoming software repositories and future yum installs will bring in software from the upcoming repositories.

To disable a repository, change the &lt;code&gt;enabled=1&lt;/code&gt; line back to &lt;code&gt;enabled=0&lt;/code&gt;.
