---++Globus Error: 17

---+++Syntax:

=GRAM Job failed because the job failed when the job manager attempted to run it (error code 17)=

---+++Known causes:

This happens when the submission to the local batch system (condor_submit, qsub, ...) fails for any reason:
   * a limit on the number of jobs for the grid account to which the user is mapped (e.g. all the user allocation has been used);
   * the corresponding queue being disabled;
   * the batch system is misconfigured or the submit command is not found by the jobmanager
   * a local user does not exist on the cluster

It is known to occur when a user is submitting a job using HTCondor and the HTCondor configuration (condor_config) file cannot be located.

It can be caused by PBS/Torque&#39;s qsub (or equivalent commands for other batch systems) if a queue is disabled.


---+++Recommendations:

Login on the CE as the unix user to which the grid job is mapped and try to submit a job to the batch system (PBS/Torque, HTCondor, LSF, SLURM, ...) using the command and the settings set in the OSG configuration of the jobmanager. You should be able to see the error and take actions to correct it.

If you have HTCondor you may need to set $CONDOR_CONFIG to the location of your condor_config file by exporting it in an initialization script. See also [[Documentation/Release3.IniConfigurationOptions#Condor][the CE HTCondor configuration]].
