---+!! Updating the Compute Element
%TOC{depth=&quot;2&quot;}%

---+ About this Document
This document is for system administrators.  Here we describe how to install and configure a OSG 3.x Compute Element on your Linux machine supposing that you have already a OSG 1.2 Compute Element on the same machine (or on a machine with the same hostname).   

---+ Before you start
You may want to test the upgrade on a VM if you have it available to run through the procedure in a safe environment, specially if you have an important production site.

Some notable differences and important facts:
   * In OSG 3 the Compute Element and the RSV are 2 separate packages and the CE nor longer includes RSV as it did in OSG 1.2. You can still install both on the same server but you have to do so explicitly following the [[InstallComputeElement][CE instructions]] and the [[InstallRSV][RSV instructions]]. If you prefer, specially if you have a site with many CEs and SEs, you can install RSV on a separate host.
   * In OSG 3 the RSV service is running as the =rsv= user; it it is not there, it will be created during the RPM installation. In OSG 1.2 you were free to choose the username. If you were using a different username and are using GUMS, you will need to fix te mapping in GUMS MapServiceCertToRsvUser . 
   * This is a major upgrade. The location of all the log and status files will be different, so you will loose all the jobs running on your system, even it the jobs themselves run to successful completion on the worker node. If you want to avoid failed jobs, please let the CE drain before proceeding with the upgrade. In future upgrades, between RPM versions, you will be able to upgrade without loosing running jobs.
   * Mixed systems are not supported. It is OK to run OSG 1.2 worker nodes with OSG 3 CE or vice-versa but it is not ok to mix Pacman and RPM components within the CE .

---+ Upgrade procedure

To perform the upgrade follow the installation instructions in InstallComputeElement until the Configuration section (4.1 Run osg-configure).

To configure the CE we still use =osg-configure= (previously called =configure-osg=) but now the configuration is split in several files located in =/etc/osg/configure.d=, read in lexicographic order with options with same name and section name overriding the ones in previous files. 

If you like you can edit all the separate files using the value in your =config.ini= file and the instructions in IniConfigurationOptions. The table below will help you with the differences between the old and new configuration options.

A faster solution is to copy your old config.ini file to =/etc/osg/config.d/99-old-config.ini= (last file in the configuration directory). This way the options in this file will override the default options in the other files. 
To avoid conflicts with your existing GIP definitions in your =/etc/osg/config.d/99-old-config.ini=, make sure that all the entries in =/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini= are commented out (all lines should be already commented but please check).
Some other adjustments of the configuration variables are needed. The table below will help you with the differences between the old and new configuration options. 

Attributes that were removed (osg-configure will rise an &quot;Unknown option&quot; error if you leave them):
   * wsgram (twice)	
   * use_cert_updater	
   * enable_webpage_creation	
   * itb-metric-gratia	
   * osg-metric-gratia	
   * rsv-user	
   * user_service_cert	
   * enable_ce_probes	
   * enable_gridftp_probes	
   * enable_gums_probes	
   * enable_srm_probes	
   * setup_for_apache	
   * setup_rsv_nagios	
   * rsv_nagios_conf_file

Options that changed:
| *New value* | *Old value* | *Notes* |
| authorization_method = xacml | authorization_method = prima | Prima has been replaced by &quot;xacml&quot; (for use with GUMS). The alternative is grid-mapfile. |
| service_cert | rsv_cert_file | The option name changed |
| service_key | rsv_key_file | The option name changed |
| service_proxy | rsv_proxy_out_file | The option name changed |
| user_proxy | proxy_file | The option name changed |
| ce_hosts = %(localhost)s | ce_hosts = UNAVAILABLE | osg-configure no longer assumes that RSV is installed on the CE host. Edit this to be the proper host name |
| srm_webservice_path = srm/ managerv2 | srm_webservice_path = UNAVAILABLE | Was assuming !dCache as default. Not anymore. |

After you are done with the OSG configuration check the other sections of the [[InstallComputeElement][installation document]], specially the joba manager one (4) and then go to the services startup (7).

---+ Comments
| Like RSV, Gratia reporting is not enabled by default, site admins who previously used it will have to enable it.  For condor sites, PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR in the condor config should be updated to the new location,  /var/lib/gratia/data. | Main.SarahWilliams | 29 Mar 2012 - 20:39 |
