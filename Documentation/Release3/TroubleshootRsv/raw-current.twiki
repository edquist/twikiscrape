---+ About this Document
This document describes  how to troubleshoot !RSV v3 (part of OSG 3.0).

---+ How to get Help?
To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][Help Procedure]].
The developers of a specific metric/probe may provide additional support channel, please check the specific troubleshooting document if your metric is listed in the table below.

%INCLUDE{&quot;RsvControl&quot; section=&quot;RsvProfilerNT&quot;}%


---+ Debugging errors from specific metrics
The RSV framework runs _probes_, programs that perform tests and can measure one or more performances, _metrics_.
Each probe can be developed by different developers. Each metric can fail for different reasons and there may be precise suggestions to fix the specific problem.
The following table will send you to the right page given the metric that you want to check.

---+ Resending failed Gratia records
If RSV fails to send Gratia records, it will save a copy of the output into =/var/spool/rsv/failed-gratia-scripts=.  You will be notified if files are in this directory on your HTML status page.

If files appear here, you can attempt to determine why by looking at this log file: =/var/log/rsv/consumers/gratia-consumer.output=.  This file is rotated, so the error message may no longer be present.

Usually this error is spurious - there may have been a problem with the central collector being unavailable, or there may have been a network problem.  The first step to fix this problem is to try to resend these files.  To do so, move them back into the =gratia= directory and they will be resent the next time the gratia-script-consumer runs (about every 5 minutes):

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
mv /var/spool/rsv/failed-gratia-records/* /var/spool/rsv/gratia-consumer/
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you continue to have problems, please contact the GOC.
