---++ Setting the Hostname for Condor-G jobs

In order to submit Condor-G jobs, you need to have a publically addressable hostname.  This means you need to have a public IP (as is the case in most grid software).  It might be that you will need to set the hostname of the machine.  To do so, first you need to find out if you have a proper hostname, and setting it.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% hostname %RED%&amp;lt;hostname&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;
