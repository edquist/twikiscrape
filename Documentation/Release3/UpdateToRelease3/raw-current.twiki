---+!! Updating to Release 3
%TOC{depth=&quot;2&quot;}%

---+ About this Document
This document is for System Administrators. It explains best practices on how to upgrade from OSG 1.2, Pacman based releases, to OSG 3.0, based on RPMs.

---+ Differences between OSG 3 RPMs and OSG 1.2 Pacman installations
Here we are listing some differences in RPM installations that you should pay attention to if you are used to Pacman installations:
   * While Pacman installation are self contained (all files reside within the tree rooted in the installation directory), RPM installations spread files within the system path using FHS conventions. This means:
      * You must always be =root= to install OSG 3 software
      * Pacman installation are just using space until you source the setup file, RPM installations affect the system right away:
         * binaries are in the PATH
         * libraries may replace or upgrade installed ones and be used by other programs
         * the installation may create users or modify files
         * uninstalling the packages is more tricky
         * it is not possible to install multiple versions at the same time
      * Pacman installations could be easily shared by exporting the install directory. This is not possible for OSG 3 RPMs because files are sparse in different places in the file system.
   * Read YumRpmBasics, YumRepositories and InstallBestPractices if you are not familiar with RPMs and Yum repositories.
