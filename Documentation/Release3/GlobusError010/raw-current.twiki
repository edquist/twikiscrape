---++Globus Error: 10

---+++Syntax:

=GRAM Job submission failed because data transfer to the server failed (error code 10)=

---+++Known causes:

This is unfortunately an all-purpose Globus error. You will sometimes see it associated with problems in the grid-mapfile, but if some jobmanager (e.g. fork) works fine, then there is a different bug. Below some known causes.


*Your DN is not in the gridmap file.*

Most commonly, this error is seen by new users submitting jobs who have obtained their certificates but have not had their DN added to a VOMS server.  After a DN is added to a VOMS server, it should be taken up by all VOMS servers and added to gridmap files for the sites supporting that VO.  

There are a few exceptions: 
   * Grid administrators can remove entries from their gridmap files.
   * Grid sites are not required to support every VO.

*The jobmanager files have wrong permissions* as reported [[http://communitygrids.blogspot.com/2009/02/gram-job-submission-failed-because-data.html][here]].

*A log directory is missing* or has wrong permissions as reported [[http://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/Grid_Services][here]].

----+++Recommendations:

Check the =$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= on the Compute Element. You will probably see something like:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;Authenticated globus user: /O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=your.domain/OU=Your Name
Failure: globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization. rc =1
&lt;/pre&gt;

This indicates that your account is not in the grid-mapfile. Create the grid-mapfile in =/etc/grid-security= (or wherever the -gridmap flag in =$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-gatekeeper.conf= points to) with an entry pairing your subject name to your user name. 


If the user belongs to a VO make sure that the DN is registered in the VOMS server.
To have your DN added to a VOMS server, you will need to contact an administrator of a site currently supporting a VOMS server and have them add your DN.  They will need the following information provided by grid-proxy-init -subject:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% grid-proxy-init -subject
 /DC=org/DC=&lt;issuer&gt;/OU=&lt;group&gt;/CN=&lt;your_name&gt; &lt;unique_id&gt;/CN=&lt;CN_num&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It will take a short period of time (usually a matter of hours) for the DN to be taken up by that particular VOMS server and longer for it to spread to others.

If an administrator has removed your DN or a site does not support your VO, you should contact them with inquiries.


If the DN is correctly in the grid-mapfile or in GUMS (e.g. if the error occurrs only for some jobmanagers) then look for other causes.

The same error happened also on a CE where the LSF (PBS/HTCondor) job manager files were not given the correct permissions during the deployment. These should be 755 (group and world readable and executable). Find them with a command like ==find $GLOBUS_LOCATION -name &quot;*lsf*&quot;== and correct the permissions.
