%TOC%

---+ Introduction

The purpose of the glideinWMS is to provide a simple way to access the Grid resources. !GlideinWMS is a Glidein Based WMS (Workload Management System) that works on top of Condor. For those familiar with the Condor system, it is used for scheduling and job control.

The glideinWMS is made of several services visible in the animation copied from the [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/index.html][glideinWMS website]] (technical documentation). &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/simple_animation.gif&quot; alt=&quot;simple_animation.gif&quot; width=&#39;236&#39; height=&#39;300&#39; /&gt;    

The Frontend and the Factory are distributed by OSG as RPMs.
