---++ About This Document

This document is intended as a reference on specific tasks for users who already have
a certificate. Users who need a new certificate should instead go to the
[[CertificateGetWeb][Getting a User Certificate]] page. 

---++ Replacing an Expired Certificate

This section applies if you had a certificate from DOEgrids CA
previously and the certificate is expired after a year. You need to
get a new certificate, but you want have the same
[[Documentation.GlossaryD#DefsDistinguishedName][DN]] since then you
can continue accessing resources without any re-configuration or
changes.

Follow the steps for [[CertificateGetWeb][getting a new certificate]]
but enter your old DN in the &quot;Expired DN&quot; field.

How to find your old DN:

With openssl:
   1 Create a pem format certificate from the p12 format certificate that you
   had exported:
   &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
     openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -in usercred.p12 -out usercert.pem   &lt;/pre&gt;
   1 Get the DN from this:
   &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
        openssl x509 -noout -subject -in usercert.pem   &lt;/pre&gt;

In Firefox:
   1 Go to go to [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt; View Certificates -&gt; Your Certificates
   1 Double click on your certificate.
   1 Then click on &quot;Details&quot;, select &quot;Subject&quot; from the list in the middle,
    and &quot;Field Value&quot; in the box at the bottom is your subject.

* For assistance with renewing OSG PKI certificates please contact osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org

---++ Importing a p12 Certificate from Disk

Here is how to import your certificate to another
installation of Firefox.

   the other Firefox is running.
   1. In Firefox, go to
     [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt; View Certificates -&gt; [ Your Certificates | Authorities ] %BR%
   and click on the &quot;Import&quot; button. Use the &quot;Your Certificates&quot; pane for a personal certificate, and &quot;Authorities&quot; for a CA certificate.
   %TWISTY{
   showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
   hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
   showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
   hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
   }%
   %BR%
     %ATTACHURL%/import_certificate_1.png
   %ENDTWISTY{}%
   1. Navigate to the certificate location and &quot;Open&quot; it.
   1. Type in the password you used when you exported
   the certificate.
   1. Finally you will get a message that the import worked:%BR%
    %ATTACHURL%/import_certificate_5.png %BR%
  And the newly imported certificate should show up in Firefox&#39;s
  Certificate Manager window, which in Step 2 was empty.
