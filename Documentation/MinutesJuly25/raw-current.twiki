The osg-docs meeting will alternate weeks, this week being theDocumentation Project meeting.  Next week will be the regular meeting.  

(Ruth is differentiating b/t things directly funded (project plan, wbs, etc.) and the bigger Consortium in which we work with contributers and some work we have no control over and we take what we can get.)

---++PARTICIPANTS:

We will depend on people from outside of the project for deliverables;
We must be specific about reliance on exteral effort.

We will need a high-level statement of plans for all 5 years of project, even though the project plan will contain only one year&amp;#8217;s worth of details.

Marcia Teckenbrock: at least 50% effort; Document Librarian.
Makes sure docs being entered into repository and can make complete sets and reports.

Operations,
Etc.
Invite other people various weeks, depending on agenda

Is documentation work (for the purposes of this meeting) for the PR pages or technical documentation?
Ruth: Both  

PR is 25% of work
Technical pages:  process for review.

Need to get more effort as Katie is leaving the project (we have money for &amp;#189; time as OSG Communicator)
Anne Heavey will come back in mid-August 
(3 mo contract for another Tech Writer who will work with Anne) 


---++SHORT-TERM ACTIVITIES
1.	Write project plan and review in this meeting (OSG Communications, Documentation &amp; Tech Writing
2.	Website revamp (by consortium meeting August 21-23, 2006).
3.	Anne&amp;#8217;s documentation
Anne can talk to people during the consortium meeting to get completion and sign off:
* SC Best Practices 
* Grid Users Guide 
* Grid Application Installation Guide


---++STATUS OF WEB REVAMP:

Katie and Marcia have split up the various pages based on meetings with Ruth and XenoMedia.  There are other pages under the &amp;#8220;Getting Started&amp;#8221; section that we will need someone else to look at.  Alan Sill has agreed to help with at least some of these:

	How-to guide  (needs to be shorter, less detailed) 
Grid architecture  (include some content from OSG Services, Production Grid, Trash/Integration Grid) 
	Policies  (include some content from Service and User AUP, Security) 
Support 

It is important to have layers of documentation so as not to overwhelm visitors who want more basic information.

In parallel to providing text for website rollout, we need ample and definite procedures on how to update and review.  (on Twiki page);  Frequency of review, updates.
* Marcia will post the Project Plan on the Twiki within 2 days.

OSG Mambo site has moved to new server.
Twiki upgraded to version 4.0.4 and moved to new server.  (This will be reviewed next week).  
* Fred will pursue Steve Lloyed to get PDFMaker for Twiki.

Tools for Collaborators page:

Item for Work Plan:  We currently have Knowledge Base there; KB items need to be moved to the public (Kyle? Marcia? Anne?);  put on Twiki page for time-being.  Doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be done in time for rollout.

Does the KB need to be transferred in time for rollout?  No.  

How much flexibility for design &amp; layout of Twiki?  In theory, can do anything, but 
don&amp;#8217;t want to go too far off the beaten path.  We&amp;#8217;re nervous about making changes without being sure of what will happen.


Are we going to continue to use mambo?  If not, we should phase it out rapidly because of security risk.

Kyle wants to move to proprietary system so we don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about new exploit.  Marcia says that server support for the OSG website hasn&amp;#8217;t been ideal and would like to move to Xeno.

Decsion We will move to Xeno Media. There are costs and we are prepared to stick with them.

Ruth:  Xeno thinks 3 months max to support mambo.
