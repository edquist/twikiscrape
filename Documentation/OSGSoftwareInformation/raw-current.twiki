---+!! OSG Software Information
---++ Introduction
This page should describe OSG software at a high level and have links to Trash.Documentation_Release3DownloadOSGSoftware as well as links to the software team and software tools.

The Open Science Grid  Software Stack is available  for download and use by administrators and users of the OSG.  

The OSG Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) provides the OSG software stack. 

TBD gives detailed instructions on how to prepare a facility and/or resource and how to download and configure the OSG Software Stack in order to provide or access resources on the OSG.

A production release of the OSG Software Stack comes only after validation of the proposed software on the Trash/Trash/Integration Grid, and is based on released versions of the VDT.
