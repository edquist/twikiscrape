---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% This document gives initial information on the various ways to work with OSG as an individual user, resource owner, campus, or science project.



The  options for participating in the OSG include: 
(Consult the OSG Glossary if you encounter an unfamiliar term.)


Registration of a Resource, VO or Support Center requires agreement between the OSG and the registrant specifying services, support, contribution, proper use, and other expectations, as described in the OSG Service Agreement. 

   *  I want to use OSG resources. 
      * Users of the OSG are supported through Virtual Organizations (VOs). OSG offers three options:  to join an existing member VO (See the list of current OSG VOs ) whose scope includes the applications you want to run (e.g., OSGEDU – the education VO for students and teachers); to form a new VO for your research community and register it with OSG; and to be hosted by one of the OSG supported VOs. 
   *  I want to get my application running on OSG. The OSG Engagement team works closely with science communities new to grid computing, helping them to understand how to use a distributed computing infrastructure and to adapt their applications to run effectively on OSG resources.
   *  I want information about adapting my campus IT facility to form a campus grid. OSG is committed to including US universities in the national cyberinfrastructure.    
      * The OSG middleware and operational framework enables any site to participate as an OSG resource, provided it is a well maintained resource that users can count on. Technically there are no hurdles in having every US university and college contribute resources to OSG and use OSG resources in return. Several campuses have done so very well: Purdue University, University of Wisconsin- Madison, and Clemson University. Several other universities participate in OSG through individual research groups. Learn more about enabling your campus community to access OSG&#39;s resources. 
   *  I want to federate or partner my grid with OSG.  Federation, therefore, is a natural concept within OSG. This is not structured as a hierarchy with OSG or any other grid at the &quot;top&quot;, rather, we support and aim for broad connectivity and interoperability. We are interested in partnerships with other grids trying to develop richer methods and tools for federation. If you wish to pursue such a partnership, please contact a member of the OSG Executive Board. 
   *  I want to make resources available to OSG. Many different kinds of resources can be made available. 
      * The basic requirements for an OSG resource are intentionally kept minimal and of themselves are insufficient to assure interoperability. In order to provide a stable, interoperable base on which to build applications, each OSG release defines a set of &quot;standard&quot; services which define the requirements on interfaces and capabilities. You will need to register your resource(s) with the Grid Operations Center. For further information, start at the documentation hub. 
   *  I want to help build OSG 
      * Contributing participants are essential to the continued growth and vitality of the Open Science Grid Consortium, and we welcome your efforts and enthusiasm. The best way to get started is to send an email to osg-contact or go through a contact person that you already know. Also feel free to contact the OSG executive director to discuss your interests and capabilities. Work in OSG is done in &quot;Activities&quot; coordinated through mailing lists which are open to new members. Interested parties can self-subscribe to most lists.
   * I want to have a community on the OSG.   &quot;Form a new VO.&quot;
