[[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][ReleaseDocumenation]]

This procedure describes how to make documentation for a [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][OSG release]] from documentation for an [[Trash/Trash/Integration.WebHome][Integration]] release. This differs from moving from one ITB release to another ITB release. 

%IMPORTANT% This requires write permissions to the TWiki tree on the Unix server hosting TWiki.

   1. From within the TWiki directory, copy the existing documentation from the Trash/Trash/Integration subdirectories: %BR%
      =$ cp ./data/Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB_&amp;#60;NUMBER&gt; ./data/ReleaseDocumentation/Release_&amp;#60;NUMBER&gt;= %BR%  =$ cp ./pub/Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB_&amp;#60;NUMBER&gt; ./pub/ReleaseDocumentation/Release_&amp;#60;NUMBER&gt;= %BR% This copies both the TWiki topics and the associated attachments.
   1. Check the file permissions in the new directory. The directory and files should have the same permissions as other ReleaseDocumentation subwebs.
   1. Edit =&lt;nop&gt;ReleaseDocumentation.Release_&amp;#60;NUMBER&gt;.WebHome= to reflect the new status as a release.
   1. Edit =&lt;nop&gt;ReleaseDocumentation.Release_&amp;#60;NUMBER&gt;.WebPreferences= for changes to TWiki editing permissions, etc. The subweb will inherit the WebPreferences of the parent web.
   1. Search the new Release subweb for references to Integration.

Done.
