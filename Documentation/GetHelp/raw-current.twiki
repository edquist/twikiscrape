#SubmitTroubleTicket
---++ About Trouble Tickets
---+++ When to submit a trouble ticket
There are clear-cut situations that require opening a trouble ticket, and others that are ambiguous. [[GridUsersGuideTroubleshootingOSG][To submit or not to submit, that is the question.]]

Also see [[ReleaseDocumentation/TroubleTickets][Trouble Tickets]]. &lt;!--These pages need to be resolved; AH 2/19/08--&gt;

---+++ For OSG software assistance, what information should you include?
When you submit a ticket for assistance, please make sure to include your Operating System and OSG or VDT version. Even better, if your software installation is at least partly completed, you can use =osg-system-profiler= to collect information about your system that may help debug the problem. 

OSG-system-profiler creates a file called =osg-profile.txt= in the current directory. This file contains all sorts of information that might be useful in debugging your problem. For example, it contains the OS, hostname, disk space, network interfaces, and contents of /etc/grid-security, among other things. The program is a straightforward Bourne shell script, in case you&#39;re curious to see it.
