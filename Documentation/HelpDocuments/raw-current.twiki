---+ OSG Documents
There are documents targeting from the novice to the experienced user or site administrator.
For users, a list of available documentation is on the [[Documentation/Release3.NavUserMain][User Navigation Page]].

On the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][OSG Web Site]] you can find pointers to technical documentation, monitoring, events and general information.
&lt;!-- [[Documentation.WebHome][]] --&gt;
The [[Main.WebHome][OSG Twiki]] is the main documentation hub. 

For information about the current software, refer to the main page of the specific OSG software release, e.g. [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][OSG 1.2]] or [[Documentation/Release3.WebHome][Release3]].

If you are looking for information and examples on bringing up a cluster from scratch, you should look at the [[Trash/Tier3.WebHome][Tier 3 guide]].

---+ Site Administrator Resources
&lt;!--
If you are part of an organization that is already present in OSG, like the LHC experiments, we recommend you to contact your organization first. Some have support and contact information [[%INCLUDINGWEB%.%INCLUDINGTOPIC%#VOResourcesList][below]].
--&gt;

If you are having trouble in installing and configuring OSG resources, you can get support coming to the [[%INCLUDINGWEB%.%INCLUDINGTOPIC%#Chat_support][Campfire web chat]] or sending an email to [[%INCLUDINGWEB%.%INCLUDINGTOPIC%#Email_Lists_for_Support][one of our mailing lists]] or by joining the =osg@conference.indiana.edu= IM chat.  If the problem is a bug or some unresponsive resource, you may also [[%INCLUDINGWEB%.%INCLUDINGTOPIC%#Trouble_Tickets][open a ticket]] about it.

The [[%INCLUDINGWEB%.%INCLUDINGTOPIC%#Grid_Operations_Center][OSG Grid Operation Center]] provides  [[%INCLUDINGWEB%.%INCLUDINGTOPIC%#Emergency_Assistance][emergency assistance]] via phone support.

---++ Security incident
Security incidents can be reported by following the instructions on the [[Documentation.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][Incident Discovery and Reporting]] page.  Additional steps to aid in the incident handling process are also linked from that page.
