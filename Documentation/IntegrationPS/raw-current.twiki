---++ perfSONAR  Introduction and  Motivation


The  perfSONAR  Team  has provided  an excellent  set  of  pages  describing  what  perfSONAR  is, how it  works and why you  may want  to use it.  Have a look  at http://www.perfsonar.net/about/.

For WLCG and  OSG  we  want to provide some more specific details motivating the  use  of  perfSONAR.   *WLCG  and  OSG sites rely upon the network to provide access to their computing and storage.*  The network provides the basis for users to access those resources and for virtual organizations to organize the sharing and use of their member&#39;s resources.   When there are problems in the network, it can significantly degrade or even disable users and VOs ability to do their science.   

Networking problems can be difficult to identify and isolate for numerous reasons:
   * Network paths typically span multiple administrative domains with no single entity having complete access to the end-to-end infrastructure components
   * Applications that work well on a Local Area Network (LAN) may behave significantly differently when run on a Wide Area Network (WAN) due to the impact of latency on the network communication involved
   * End-host or LAN issues may be the actual source of problems and differentiating HOST vs LAN vs WAN problems can be difficult without sufficient expertise
   * Problems that actually exist on a host or in the LAN may not be &quot;visible&quot; in local use and only show up when the application is used in the WAN.  The tendency is to believe the WAN is the problem even though it many cases it isn&#39;t
   * Real WAN problems are hard to localize and it is not practical or effective to contact every entity managing a portion of the network path on which you see a problem.   

Our goal is to help users, VOs and site administrators better understand their network infrastructure and enable them to more effectively find problems and isolate their root cause.  To do this we are recommending that all WLCG/OSG sites deploy [[http://docs.perfsonar.net/#installation][perfSONAR-PS Toolkit]] instances in their infrastructure.

---++ Benefits 

*By deploying perfSONAR-PS Toolkit instances sites and users will benefit in a number of ways:*

   * Once installed the PS toolkit instances can serve as an on-demand test point, allowing both local and remote users to test the network connection between them and the site
   * The site can participate in automated, regularly scheduled tests of their network which provide
      * A baseline for their network behavior to/from other OSG sites
      * Data of the historical and current network performance to other sites of interest
      * The ability to determine when problems began or when some change impacted the network
      * A set of metrics which are used by network engineers to find and isolate network problems.
      * The ability to identify network bottlenecks where upgrades may be helpful
   * Sites will be instrumented in a standard way so that if network problems are suspected, remote operators can easily make a first-pass diagnosis without the site needing to do anything
   * Users will have the ability to check the network metrics when they suspect a network issue, without needing to involve site managers or network engineers.

Our focus has been on providing a toolkit that is robust and will hopefully operate with minimal effort from the site.   Our goal is to deliver a reliable,  easy-to-maintain  installation  that provides a network test-point for each site.

---++ Requirements

We support both OSG  and  WLCG  in  deploying,  configuring and managing perfSONAR and  there  are  distinct  requirements  and  use-cases  for  both. The  WLCG perfSONAR instances are mandated for  Tier-0,  Tier-1  and  Tier-2  sites  (those bound  by MOU agreements).     For  OSG  we are  encouraging  perfSONAR  deployments  at all  sites.    

To participate, each site should plan on providing one or two inexpensive computers that should be co-located with the sites primary storage (or computing if there is no grid storage at the site).   One instance will be used to measure throughput and one instance will measure latency, packet-loss and network route paths.  As  of  version 3.4 of  perfSONAR it  is possible  to  use  one physical  host to support both throughput  and  latency measurements.

A quick note on the physical location for the WLCG/OSG perfSONAR-PS instances: *Our strong recommendation is to co-locate perfSONAR-PS node(s) with the sites primary grid-storage*.   The reason is that we want the perfSONAR instances to measure as much of the *network* data transfer path as is possible, end-to-end.    The perfSONAR-PS measurements are intended to represent what the network is doing end-to-end and can be used to differentiate network problems from end-host/storage/software problems.

The developers have provided an overview  of [[http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_sys_requirements.html][system  requirements]] that  we recommend reading.

The  WLCG installations are currently organized centrally by using a &quot;mesh-configuration&quot; stored at a URL.     A  perfSONAR  mesh defines  a  set of  sites,  tests  and  test  parameters to control  which metrics are regularly measured.  *For  WLCG Tier-0,  Tier-1  and Tier-2  sites there is  a requirement  that they configure  their  perfSONAR  instances  to  participate  in  specific  meshes.*  Note  that  WLCG  Tier-3 sites are  *not included*  in  these  meshes  and  we  are working on determining the best way to  organize  Tier-3 sites.

The  OSG  installations  currently  do not  have OSG-specific  meshes  in place.   Meshes are important to ensure sets of sites  that  work together regularly exchanging  data have regular  testing in place.  Within OSG we  are discussing options  for  how  to  create,  organize  and manage  the  creation  of new meshes to  organize  OSG  (and WLCG Tier-3) sites.   For those interested in more  details  we  have a separate page devoted to  MeshesForperfSONAR  which  goes  into  more  details  on perfSONAR meshes, related tools  and  plans for managing them.

Some details on other requirements:

   * *Hardware:*  Some hardware recommendations are available at http://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/perfsonar/ps-howto/hardware/
   * *Network Connection:*  We recommend using a network connection that is representative of your local site connectivity.   If you have 1G for your systems, you should install a throughput node with 1G network interfaces; if you  have 10G for your storage or primary systems you should install a node with 10G interfaces.
   * *Registration:*  We have documented how you should register your instance in OIM at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/RegisterPSinOIM][http://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/RegisterPSinOIM]]  or  for  GOCDB at
