---+ About this document
This document is mainly for [[Documentation/Release3.NavAdminSmallSites][small sites]] and provides a brief overview of some networking concepts and possible topologies for an OSG cluster.

---+ Introduction

Your campus or your department will provide you a network connection that, in this documet, we refer as the _extranet_ (everything outside of the Firewall you manage), i.e. the network that connects also to the world outside of your OSG cluster.

Depending on geographical and hardware constraints or on your choices, the nodes of a cluster can be connected using the different topologies described in the following sections.
A default configuration, including subnet IP address, is described as well.

The diagrams below have acronyms referring to possible nodes.
The [[Documentation/Release3.NavAdminSmallSites][small sites navigation document]] presents possible components of a cluster.
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% showlink=&quot;Click here to show more detailed example of a useful node naming convention&quot; }%   
Here is a naming example to simplify documentation and examples.
We give a name to the cluster: =gc= (Grid Cluster). Each node in the cluster is named according its functionality and has a unique fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  The FQDN includes a local hostname and a parent domain name (here &quot;yourdomain.org&quot;). 
The following is a list of roles (abstract functionalities) that nodes may have within the cluster and corresponding hostnames. This means that the host that is your compute element (if you have a CE) has an FQDN =gc-ce.yourdomain.org=.
A node may have more than one name if it runs more than one service. If a node is covering two or more roles, then all those names will refer to the same node and can be _cnames_, e.g. the Storage Element and the Xrootd redirector may be co-located on the same node, making =gc-se= and =gc-xrdr= different names (aliases) of the same node. If there are no nodes covering a role then there will be no node with that name. 
Here is a list of possible names and intended functionalities:
| *Acronym* | *Short* | *Hostname* | *Description* |
| UI | =gc-ui= | =gc-ui.yourdomain.org= | The user interface machine, can also be referred to as Interactive node 1 (you may have more than one) |
| WN | =gc-wn001= | =gc-wn001.yourdomain.org= | Worker Node 1 (usually you have several) |
|| =gc-wn002= | =gc-wn002.yourdomain.org= | Worker Node 2 ...(at least 2) |
| SN | =gc=sn001= | =gc-sn001.yourdomain.org= | Storage Node 1 ..., sometime co-located with a Worker Node (usually you have several) |
| NFS | =gc-nfs= | =gc-nfs.yourdomain.org= | The NFSv4 server |
| HN | =gc-hn= | =gc-hn.yourdomain.org= | The queue head-node |
| SE | =gc-se= | =gc-se.yourdomain.org= | The Storage Element |
| CE | =gc-ce= | =gc-ce.yourdomain.org= | The Compute Element |
| XRDR | =gc-xrdr= | =gc-xrdr.yourdomain.org= | The xrootd redirector |
| GUMS | =gc-gums= | =gc-gums.yourdomain.org=  | The GUMS server |
| Squid | =gc-proxy= | =gc-proxy.yourdomain.org= | Squid (proxy) server |
| NAT | =gc-net= | =gc1-net.yourdomain.org= | The networking box with Firewall/Router (e.g. NAT server) |

---+ Topology with intranet and extranet
The recommended configuration for a OSG cluster includes a second network, _intranet_ (internal LAN or VLAN), connecting only nodes of the cluster. In this topology, visible in Fig. 1, the intranet is normally a &quot;private&quot; network, connected to the extranet using a NAT and proxy server (a Firewall). This provides better security, because several nodes have limited network access, and limits the number of IP addresses used by the OSG cluster, specially for clusters with many nodes(&gt;30). Worker nodes do not require a public IP and this way they can work without it.

   * Fig. 1 - Topology with intranet and extranet: &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/network1.png&quot; alt=&quot;network1.png&quot; width=&#39;683&#39; height=&#39;172&#39; /&gt;    

Most of the time all nodes require outbound network connectivity and this can be provided by a proxy server (e.g. Squid) and/or a NAT (network address translation) server.
Some nodes will require also inbound network connectivity and this can be provided using port forwarding on the NAT server or by connecting those nodes to both the intranet and the extranet. We will choose the latter.

Nodes usually only on the intranet:
   * NFS - Network File System
   * WN - Worker Nodes
   * HN - Head Node of the Local Resource Manager (e.g. Condor Collector and Negotiator)
   * SN - Storage Nodes

Nodes that can benefit from being on the extranet are:
   * NAT - Network Address Translator.  Necessary if you want to provide outbound connectivity to the nodes in the intranet
   * Squid - Proxy server and web cache daemon.  Recommended to improve performance.
   * SE - Storage Element.  Recommended to be on the extranet so outside users have access your SE
   * CE - Compute Element.  Recommended to be on the extranet so outside users have access your CE
   * UI - User Interface or interactive node.  Only if you want outside access to your UI (e.g. ssh login)
&lt;!--   * NFS server - only to improve performance? something else? Check notes of installation with Rik --&gt;

To simplify the documentation we are choosing here a default configuration for the intranet.

&lt;!--
The default address for the intranet (subnet) used in the small sites documents is 192.168.192.0/18. This defines a subnet with 18 bits fixed for the network addresses and 14 bits available for the hosts. This means that you can have up to 16,191 private IP addresses from 192.168.192.1 to 192.168.255.254.
--&gt;

---+ Simplified network topology
If the previous topology is not possible, either because the nodes of the OSG cluster are scattered across campus, or because the hardware does not allow it, or by choice, then all the nodes of the cluster can reside on the same network (extranet and intranet are the same), like shown in Fig. 2.

   * Fig. 2 - Network topology with a single network: &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/network2.png&quot; alt=&quot;network2.png&quot; width=&#39;628&#39; height=&#39;140&#39; /&gt;    

All the cluster nodes will connect directly to your &quot;public&quot; network. Therefore, you will need to obtain an IP address from your local network administrator for each of the hosts you will include in your OSG cluster. 
In this case the subnet and the IP addresses will be those provided by the network administrator.

---+ Campus/Department network
The extranet is the network provided to you for your cluster by the campus or the department. 
The extranet may be a &quot;public&quot; network, directly connected to the Internet or bridged to it. It may also be that you are provided with an 
extranet which is a private network provided internally to your campus or department (intranet for the campus or department), which is is separated from the Internet by a firewall that limits the access. The two examples are shown in Fig. 3.

   * Fig. 3 - Network connection to the outside: &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/network-connection.png&quot; alt=&quot;network-connection.png&quot; width=&#39;336&#39; height=&#39;246&#39; /&gt;    

If your configuration is the latter you have to make sure (talking to your network administrators) that at least the Storage Element and the Compute Element are visible on the &quot;public&quot; Internet so that they can be available on the Grid.
It is also convenient for interactive nodes to be &quot;public&quot; so that users may log in directly to them and a Web proxy could also be on the &quot;public&quot; network for performance reasons.
Read also the [[Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation][Release 3 Firewall information document]] for further network requirements.

&lt;!--
Furthermore if the extranet is a subnet in the range 192.168.x.y, and x &amp;gt;= 192, then the default configuration mentioned above will not work (there may be conflicts in the assigned IP). In this case the subnet used for the intranet has to be different from the default, read further the [[IntranetNotes][intranet notes]] to find out which documents are affected.
