*Summary of Reviewer Comments from the Review of the OSG in January 2008:*

   * The project needs to more concretely demonstrate linkage in the OSG program of work to the requirements and schedule of LHC/LIGO projects.

   * The project needs clear metrics that inform the JOT of the progress of OSG related to the LHC,  LIGO, other stakeholders and the sponsoring agencies and also present more clearly the contributions of the project to science.

   * There is a concern that the project has not demonstrated the scalability of the operations model, nor published means to measure the reliability and productiveness of the facility.

   * There is concern over the increasing scope of the software stack.

   * There is a lack of evidence on how the project management takes decisions and prioritizes across the ever increasing demands.

   * The project needs to better demonstrate its&amp;#8217; positive impact on research and citations in scientific publications.

   * The project needs to more clearly present whether there is a collaborative relationship with the stakeholders and providers, or whether there is a goal to have a supplier-customer data-center relationship.
