*Support Statement provided by David Swanson for Holland Computing Center Council Members:*

The HCC VO will be a local state-wide grid for the Holland Computing Center at the University of Nebraska.  While HCC has a strong affiliation with the US CMS project as a Tier-2 site, we have recently had a growing number of local users inquire about accessing the considerable resources of the Open Science Grid.  We have utilized both OSG-MM and glideinWMS to develop workflows for local users running a variety of bioinformatics utilities, including autodock and rosetta.  HCC supports interfaces to local machines named Firefly and Prairiefire that provide a combined 6000 processors  for opportunistic use to the OSG with local HCC staff. The HCC VO will allow us to engage a growing Nebraska user community, and to monitor and assist these NU researchers as they migrate their code to OSG.
