&lt;b&gt;Report from subgroup working on Science Domain Reporting&lt;/b&gt;

Scott and Ruth talked this morning; We will follow up with the VO representatives and work with Abhishek, Rob Q, Brian, and Philippe on an end to end solution that reports to the Site Administrators the science domain of the users. The first site we will work with is FermiGrid (Keith Chadwick) -  it was the Fermilab Council rep who initiated the request.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Report from subgroup working on the Science Advisory Group&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;OSG Consortium Scientific Advisory Group (SAG)&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;from the OSG Management Plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
   A Scientific Advisory Group consisting of leading scientists provides guidance to Council and Executive Board. The Scientific Advisory Group reviews the effectiveness of the benefits of OSG to the scientific mission of the stakeholders and provides feedback on the program of work to achieve this. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group are appointed by the Council Chair and confirmed by the Council. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group include:
   •    Lead scientists from the major OSG stakeholder organizations,
   •    Lead scientists from external projects and sponsoring organizations,
   •    OSG Council Chair (ex-officio),
   •    OSG Executive Director, Resources Manager, Facility Coordinator and Applications Coordinator (ex-officio)

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAG 2007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The first meeting of the SAG was June 12 2007. The members who attended Dr. Barry Barish, Dr. David Schwartz, Dr. Helene Armitage. The discussion summary as well as the agenda are posted at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/DisplayMeeting?conferenceid=68

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAG 2009&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
We propose invitations and individual approaches to new members of the committee, with the following framework: Phone meetings annually or semi-annually; One or two topics to focus on for each meeting with information distributed ahead of time; Capture of the results of the discussion by the OSG ex-officio members; Rotation of membership based on discussion but not specified up front; Meeting during calendar 2009.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Executive Directors Report&lt;/b&gt;

We received the official report from the review in January. It is the same as the un-official report received earlier. If you would like a copy please email me.  We are asked to reply with how we plan to address the questions asked.

&lt;i&gt;Technology (architecture) Group &lt;/i&gt; convened but no meetings until John Hover is back from vacation this week. 

James Howlson – &lt;i&gt; CMU VOSS project &lt;/i&gt; – will be contacting proposed VO contacts soon. The project is proposing a small discussion workshop in January. 

&lt;i&gt; NEES proposal &lt;/i&gt;  awarded to Purdue (reuse of Nanohub/Hub0 as NEEShub) which includes Ruth on the Program Advisory Group and Community Task Force (charge in discussion). First meeting with the Equipment Sites – and hopefully some users - is this coming week. Equipment Sites represented: Cornell University, Lehigh University, Oregon State University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, University of California, Berkeley, University of California Davis, University of California Los Angeles, University of Californi  Santa Barbara , University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, University of Nevada Reno ,University of Texas Austin.

Meeting of &lt;i&gt; iSGTW US advisory board &lt;/i&gt;  in August laid out possible satellite proposal over the next few months. This is timely as the EU is putting in a continuation (and expansion) proposal this fall. Plan is that this be a collaboration with TeraGrid. Judy Jackson, Miriam Boon and Elizabeth Leake are leading the work. 

Working with Susan Turnbull on &lt;i&gt; ESNET requirements workshop &lt;/i&gt;  texts.

&lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt;OSG GridUNESP Partnership Next Steps &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Sergio Novaes, leader of the GridUNESP regional grid in Sao Paolo, Brazil, has told us that they have clusters and storage installed a 6 sites, are installing the OSG software stack and are looking for more focused collaboration on operations and user support services and roadmap.

I am  pleased to tell you that Horst Severini has agreed to be the 
liaison from OSG/  Horst has much expertise in both running a US ATLAS Tier-2 and 
supporting applications from a broad range of sciences on Oaklahoma 
University&#39;s campus grid.   Horst is already planning to 
attend the workshop in Brazil in  September and would plan to work on writing down 
the set of activities and goals with OSG operations and the gridUNESP team when he is 
there.   This will feed into the program of work for OSG in FY10, a 
revision of the existing partnership agreement
https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=827&amp;version=1&amp;filename=GridUNESP-OSG_signed.pdf

There are several faces to the OSG support and GRidUNESP activities we
will work through Horst. I know there will be other areas of involvement 
as we proceed but for the moment there are 4 I would like to pick up on 
in the short term. 

a) operations, operations services - how the division of 
responsibilities and roles between GridUNESP and OSG will work and 
evolve. Horst will work with Rob Quick on these items. I would like the 
topic to be a standing agenda item in the weekly Monday operations 
meetings that the GOC runs and I believe Horst at least sometimes 
already attends. I will also be asking Sebastien to be up to date on 
what is happening and understand if there are areas where the OSG Campus 
Grids activity can help and be involved.

b) users of both the GridUNESP and OSG resources - how we have separate 
responsibilities and also work together with the user communities. I 
would like this to initially come under the umbrella of Trash/Engagement and 
ask John McGee, Chris Green and Horst to work together with GridUNESP.

c) software - GridUNESP is another user of the VDT and will work through 
OSG software, VDT support and request mechanisms as other groups and 
projects do.

d) security - I would like Horst to talk to the OSG Security Team before 
he goes to Brazil to get a list of items to raise while he is there and 
to input to the planning.



&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;EGI HEP Specialized Support Center (HEPSSC) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

We are working through Jamie Shiers with respect to an unfunded partnership between OSG and the HEPSSC for the future support of LHC and HEP experiments. A legal institution must sign the paperwork. We will do this through Miron and the University of Wisconsin Madison  - who were already partners with the previous and current phases of EGEE.

Draft text of the partnership (limited to 1 page) is
