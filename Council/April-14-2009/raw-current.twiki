%BLUE% *minutes:*

Please contact Paul Avery (avery@phys.ufl.edu) to provide corrections or additions.

Collective VO (Shaowen Wang): Shaowen discussed the Collective (formerly At-Large) VO activity. He noted that it had been
agreed that there would be 2 Council
seats for approximately 12 smaller VOs lacking other representation. This mechanism allows these VOs to participate
in and influence OSG decisions. While he is still ramping up his activity, Shaowen has been attending the biweekly VO Forum
phone discussions (all VOs participate, with a focus on a particular VO every call) hosted by Abishek as a way to learn more
about VO participation in OSG, including which are active, what specific issues they are facing and what channels are needed
to make progress. Shaowen plans to interview VO representatives over time.

SBGrid (Piotr Sliz): They have a hired a new sysadmin (Peter Doherty) who is coming up to speed. He will be taking a Condor
training course in Wisconsin within a few weeks. The new peson has been converting an
Intel-based cluster to add to their OSG resource, handling a complication caused by a domain name change. Piotr has been
active in the Boston area talking to people active in biomedical and bioinformatics areas with a view to have them participate in
OSG. He also noted that there are new NIH computing initiatives but that there is intense competition for the new funds.

ATLAS (Michael Ernst): Michael discussed the recent ATLAS cosmic data campaign. They were particularly interested in prestaging data and carried out
some tests at BNL and SLAC (which is an ATLAS Tier-2) to test this feature. (_More needed here?_)

D0 (Brad Abbott): D0 has had some file delivery issues at non-SE sites, but is otherwise doing OK. Their usage statistics have
been substantially higher for the past few weeks.

STAR (Jerome Lauret): Jerome reported on a substantial computing effort that was conducted on the Amazon EC2 cloud using
the Nimbus VM technology being developed by Kate Keahey and her group as part of the CEDPS project. The story is covered in some detail at ISGTW at
[[http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1001735]]. Jerome would like to see both increased OSG activity in the VM and Cloud area and an OSG statement indicating at a minimum its relevance to our future directions. These virtualization technologies were a focus of the March All-Hands meeting (see [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=2012]].
