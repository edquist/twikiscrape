---++ Minutes

---++ Action Items from Meeting:

 1. *Paul Avery*; Communicate with Ian regarding Globus Alliance position on Council.

 2. *Shaowen Wang &amp; Doug Olson*; Develop and document a process for removing a council representative on the basis of participation. This should include an &quot;inactive state&quot;, which also has a process for returning to &quot;active status&quot; based on the procedures to be developed and documented. This process should be reviewed by the council before ratification.

 3. *Ruth Pordes, John McGee &amp; Piotr Sliz*; Develop a document covering &quot;expectations&quot; for coming into the OSG. Collective VO representatives reported that there were lots of questions regarding how to interact with the funding agencies as a member of the OSG. One example VO was noted as SBGrid in the discussion.

 4. *Chander Sehgal*; Find out the end data for SciDAC II

&lt;verbatim&gt;

Regarding action item 4, I believe the end-date for Scidac-2 is &quot;mid-2011&quot; based on 

http://www.er.doe.gov/ASCR/News/NewsSciDAC-2.html

If a more precise date is needed, I can try to contact our program officers.

Thanks,
Chander 
 
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

 5. *Ruth Pordes, John McGee, Vicky White, Michael Ernst, Doug Olson*; Wordsmith the &quot;Mission Statement&quot; presented to the Council.

 6. *Ruth Pordes, Paul Avery, Miron Livny, Michael Ernst, Kent Blackburn*; Work to revise the Management Plan.

 7. *Ruth Pordes, John McGee, Dan Fraser, Frank Wuerthwein*; Develop strategy for approach XD teams regarding engage, user support &amp; advanced user support by the OSG.

 8. *Kent Blackburn*; Set up a doodle poll to determine the best date for the August Face-to-Face. The Council meeting will be one day. It will be preceded by a one day meeting of proposal planning lead by Ruth. The Council will have a dinner the night before the Council meeting.
