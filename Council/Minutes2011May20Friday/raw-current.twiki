VW summarizes what was discussed yesterday. We all agree we want a functioning council, to do better. It shouldn’t be funded by the OSG program.  Make it doable in the order of 10% effort.

MOTION:  Council warmly thanks Kent for service, asks him to step down and council then take nominations or volunteers for interim co-chair to help Paul and work through to March.  Motion seconded.
