<p />
The LHC experiments continue to access resources through the OSG at increasing rates. Usage is now at &gt;1Million CPUhours/day and &gt;200 Terabytes/week distributed over the wide area network.  We continue to tune the policies and evolve the <span class="twikiNewLink">GlideinWMS<a href="/bin/edit/Council/GlideinWMS?topicparent=Council.October-12-2010" rel="nofollow" title="GlideinWMS (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> pilot frameworks to use them. We attach a chart of usage of the Glidein-WMS  pilot submission service supported by OSG and  used by  US CMS and other non-physics communities in OSG.
<p />
We are prototyping acceptance of Shibboleth based ID certificates on OSG, working with the Clemson site and the CILOGON project at NCSA. The OSG Security Team has audited and accepted  the Identity Policy (IDP) of Clemson University such that certificates from  users of that site that are mapped to X509 certificates by CILOGON can be optionally be accepted by OSG sites through a new distribution of “trusted CA’s”.  We are promoting the acceptance of the CILogon Silver CA by TAGPMA/IGTF so that users from institutions achieving the <span class="twikiNewLink">InCommon<a href="/bin/edit/Council/InCommon?topicparent=Council.October-12-2010" rel="nofollow" title="InCommon (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> Silver certification can use their home institution login to access grid resources world-wide. It is expected that the first 10-20 universities will meet the Silver level certification within a year.
<p />
The WLCG at CERN has asked the distributed set of Tier-1s to run the set of top level Information Services rather than the responsibility being centralized at CERN itself, with ad-hoc replicas around Europe.  For the US,  US LHC has asked OSG to take on this task. 
<p />
The efforts to provide the software stack in “native packaging” format is ongoing. This is a major effort and will be provide a solid base for moving forward with reducing the complexity of the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) and being able to provide and depend an increasing number of components included in Linux releases. <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/internal/native/native-package-goals-20100901.html" target="_top">http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/internal/native/native-package-goals-20100901.html</a>

The OSG storage workshop was held in September. <a href="http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=3377" target="_top">http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=3377</a> . It  looked at the experiences of the sites administrators, with  time for interaction with developers and the OSG storage support team. The post workshop survey indicated that the workshop was useful for the attendees, with the usual caveat that there was too much presentation and not enough discussion time. 
<p />
The OSG High Throughput Parallel Computing satellite project is extending the Chemistry applications running on the &gt;5 OSG sites that support multi-core job execution, with a peak usage of 20,000 CPU wall clock hours a day. 
<p />
OSG has started a Campus Infrastructure activity, with a Computer Science Fellow at the University of Nebraska working on a local prototype extending the Condor flocking and glidein services, based on the local security infrastructure.  <a href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/WebHome" target="_top">https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/WebHome</a>
<p />
Both LHC experiments are investigating the use of Cloud resources – both scientific and commercial. US CMS is successfully running simulation jobs on EC2 at Amazon. The <span class="twikiNewLink">ExtenCI<a href="/bin/edit/Council/ExtenCI?topicparent=Council.October-12-2010" rel="nofollow" title="ExtenCI (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> project is running test CMS monte carlo on the scientific cloud at Purdue, WISPY.  US ATLAS is testing the Magellan installation at NERSC.
<p />
<b>Additional Information:</b>
<p />
The October newsletter is delayed because Jemise has been sick for three weeks. There have been two resignations from the OSG Project recently: Abhishek Rana is moving to some networking projects and Iwona is moving to work on Magellan at NERSC. We wish them all the best in their new responsibilities. The Executive Team is working to cover their responsibilities with other staff, and understand the responsibilities and locations of replacement effort.
<p />
There will be many OSG related talks and presentations at CHEP 2010. Brian will be giving the OSG project presentation which is on Campus Infrastructure. 
<p />
We are working to submit the 1 year extension proposal for LHC program of work to DOE by the end of the month (October). Both budget and text are being worked on.

Report from David Swanson on new project for HCC.
<p />
<font color="#0000ff"> <strong>Minutes:</strong>
<p />
David Swanson: Nebraska and Puerto Rico have received a 3-year multi-jurisdiction "Track 2" <span class="twikiNewLink">EPSCoR<a href="/bin/edit/Council/EPSCoR?topicparent=Council.October-12-2010" rel="nofollow" title="EPSCoR (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> award. This will fund some hardware but more importantly 2 FTE to HCC, one of whom will be dedicated to implementing and maintaining OSG grid protocols for PR researchers (as well as development for HCC).  Plans for HCC staff to be onsite in PR to initiate this are being finalized.  Campus grids work continues with building campus grids, building inter-campus grids, and implementing infrastructure that reflects the varied trust relationships required for this.
<p />
Chander: Still working on extension proposal to DOE because money runs out 6 months ahead of NSF. Expect to have the new proposal out by the end of October for March 2011 - March 2012. Money is currently being allocated in 6 month chunks for flexibility.
<p />
Lothar: Recent drop in CMS CPU statistics for the past two days is due to finishing a round of Monte Carlo with another one due to start soon.
<p />
Rick Snyder: CDF reprocessing ~50% of data of which they would like to conduct a significant fraction on OSG resources. They ran a successful large scale test at KISTI (Korea) in preparation for this new run.
<p />
Steve Tuecke: Globus.org File Transfer Service (FTS) v1.0 is close to being rolled out as a production service. They expect to conduct a significant number of FTS tutorials at SC10. More information about FTS can be found at the <a href="http://globus.org/service/" target="_top">FTS website</a>.
The Globus team has also been working with the VDT team on native packaging (RPMs, Debian, etc.). Expect to have first packages available in the November time period.
<p />
Miriam Boon: ISGTW has been renamed "The Digital Scientist" after a round of voting by the US and EU board. A new logo is being voted on (3 possibilities were sent to Board members today). The web page is being redone and will be relaunched soon in stages, with the first stage expected by the end of November. Miriam is working with the Fermilab SC10 booth people to have some information about The Digital Scientist under its new name.
<p />
Ruth: Jemise will contact Piotr Sliz about the All Hands Meeting March 7-9, with Council meeting afternoon of March 10 and morning of March 11.
