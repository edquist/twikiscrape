---++ Review

The review seemed to go well. The slides, questions etc are posted at  http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2294 (I will give the access code in the meeting).

The only official response to date was a summary at the closeout:

1.	OSG is a very critical piece of the infrastructure for the LHC and potentially important for LIGO.&lt;br&gt;
2.	This initiative has significant potential value for other large-scale science endeavors.&lt;br&gt;
3.	Clear that model for incorporating new HW resources can be successful – i.e. enabled CDF resources for D0 re-processing.&lt;br&gt;
4.	Some panelists felt that scientific productivity argument could be presented in a more compelling manner.&lt;br&gt;
5.	Reliance on HEP-VO model may not map for new VOs (homogeneity, unified purpose not in place for most other communities)&lt;br&gt;
a.	Can’t rely on interaction with VOs to effectively represent what’s happening in end user community.&lt;br&gt;
6.	 National cyberinfrastructure, of this type (OSG) is important, getting established and funding agencies need to appreciate the importance of this evolution.  Encourage broad thinking on this by agencies and researchers.&lt;br&gt;
a.	Larger returns possible from serving large scale science (short term) communities. (i.e. climate community)&lt;br&gt;
7.	 Continue to engage in the larger strategic questions of national cyberinfrastructure(s) among relevant parties.  Continue to iterate on the best rules and framework for federation – evolutionary and strategic for all large cyberinfrastructures – be focused and need-driven (i.e. archival storage).  Create conditions at the right levels for discussion of frontier issues of cyberinfrastructures.&lt;br&gt;
8.	Presentations addressed the charge questions, but didn’t tell OSG’s excellent story in a cohesive way. Led with management structure, more effective to lead with the vision, purpose, mechanisms and science accomplishments. (i.e. architecture diagrams at the beginning – and one level up)&lt;br&gt;

---++ Production Coordinator
There have been 2 applicants for production coordinate. The Executive Team, Council Co-chairs, Operations Coordinator and co-leads of the Software Tools Group have interviewed both candidates. Based on the feedback I have made a recommendation for a 1 year commitment to date. 

---++ New Council Member
I would like to recommend SBGrid have a place on the Council. Kent has invited Piotr Sliz to the March Council meeting where we would make a presentation for membership. 

---++ Usage of OSG 

*New request from Geant4:*

Geant4 is interested in using OSG for regression testing of release validation. Here is the message from John Apostolakis --
Regression tests of candidate Geant4 releases simulate many different setups of simplified HEP calorimeters. A large number of observables are monitored and compared to results of a baseline version. The number of configurations ranges between 200 and 2500 different setups. Jobs run typically from 2-20 hours each. Several candidate versions must be tested. Need at least 2-day turnaround on most test batches. Currently large jobs are assigned about 200 CPUs and take about 3 days. Target is to test each release candidate within 1 day turnaround time for small/medium sets of jobs (200-500 configurations) and 2 days for the largest sets (2500 jobs). The tests of several successive release candidates must be undertaken during a known 3 week period before the release. Total run time of 6-8 Giga-Ops years, depending on the issues identified and the resulting number of correction and corresponding candidate releases. Expected timeline to start is late February&#39;09.

*D0*
looking for more sites to run MC on, including use of Storage. EB discussing how best to approach this. 

*General*
The usage of OSG is continuing to grow with the ramp up of all physics VOs and SBGrid. http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Usage_Stats
