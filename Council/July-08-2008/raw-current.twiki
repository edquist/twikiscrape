Ruth reported that OSG&#39;s V 1.0 software stack has been released. There have been some minor issues which are bing addressed. This Thursday there is an OSG Sites Telecon which will discuss the benefits of 1.0 and provide some real experiences from site administrators.

RSV is now published from the GOC. A significant amount of work has gone into determining its reliability and accuracy. WLCG has now accepted that all the information is legitimate at this time. Expect to be publishing from this in the July report. This amounts to about a one month delay from original schedule.

_%MAROON%(A) We are following our Council accepted policy for including Certificate Authority root certificates in the OSG distribution. Recent specific issues with the inclusion of the Iran CA mean that we are planning to update this policy and will seek some Council guidance on the OSG projects responsibilities. %ENDCOLOR%_ [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=752&amp;version=1&amp;filename=Approval_of_CA_v3.doc][link to current Policy]]

Ruth reported that issues have been raised by several sites. These sites reported that they fall under Export Administration Regulations (EAR) which ban their allowing access from for individuals from Iran. The OSG Security Officier is in discussions with lawyers at Fermilab and Oak Ridge and will advise the OSG once clear guidance is available. In the meantime, the Exec. Team is looking into a process that would distribute CA root certificates to sites based on the usage of CAs by the sum of all VOs. This has been determined to met with WLCG policy.

_%MAROON%(B) Review of &quot;Definitinions of Year 2 Metrics&quot; by OSG Council %ENDCOLOR%_ [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/0007/000740/002/Year%202%20Baseline%20Metrics%20Definitions-V2.doc][link to Definitions]]

The year two update to the Year 2 Metrics were driven by feedback from the OSG Review earlier this year. There were 6 new metrics added as a result. In total there are now 16 metrics. A decision has been made to couple these metrics to WLCG metrics. Expect some will not me met this year. Determining benefit to stakeholders is noted as being both important to the agencies and also difficult to gather/provide. OSG is able to measure all of these metrics to varying degrees of precision. There is a self imposed goal to publich mid year reports on these.

There is a draft report which need inputs from the major stakeholders. ATLAS and CMS were contacted about this need for inputs on July 2nd and currently awaiting response. Ruth will be contacting LIGO after today&#39;s meeting. Lothar noted that acknowledgements to agencies are typical. It was also pointed out that it was difficult to provide acknowledgements to everyone as there are a large number of groups that contribute to a publication. DZero and LIGO both reported that similiar discussions had occurred in they projects and there had been concern expressed about this very issue.%ENDCOLOR%%BLUE%

Ruth reported that Fred Johnston of the DOE suggested that SciDAC funded projects could publish something very concise that captured a recent scientific result that benefited from the OSG. This could be as simple as a couple of slides of PowerPoint to the agency. In order for this to succeed, the OSG would need inputs from the stakeholders when a scientific publication came out. It was suggested that OSC Council Representatives could provide this on a quarterly basis and that it should be an agenda item once a quarter in OSG Council Meetings to assure awareness and timely feedback. The Council could review publications for significant OSG contribution and approve their usuage in the short write-up to the agencies.

_%MAROON% (C) XD solicitation. Any OSG council view on this?_

%BLUE%(See Ruth&#39;s June 24th report for XD Solicitation details). Ruth asked the Council for any viewpoints on this solicitation. She reported that OSG has not been involved/invited by the agencies to brainstorm on this solicitation. There have been a couple of one-on-one discussions with a few institutions involved with the OSG. Craig Stewart reported that Indiana was not planning to be involved with XD.%ENDCOLOR%

%BLUE%It was suggested by Craig Stewart that the %ENDCOLOR%[[http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf08573][Track IID]] %BLUE%Solicitation might be a better match to OSG. It has a number of new items associated with it, having been dramatically revised. In a nutshell, the award is at the level of $2M per year for maintenance, management of condor pool via the teragrid. OSG&#39;s experience with software, trouble tickets, QA are elements that would potentially align well with this solicitation.%ENDCOLOR%

Chander Sehgal reported on the slide provided in the link above, briefing the council on what has been done and what the process is. Framing of the high level goals is being achieved through meetings and discussions with the area coordinators. Also trying to provide tracking capabilities to the goals this year. Chander also reported that SLAC and Cornell would not be involved with OSG in year 3.
---+++ Update on DZERO request for expanded utilization of OSG

   * Correspondence between OSG Council co-Chairs and OSG Executive Director ([[June-11-2008 correspondence ][Email]]) 

%BLUE%minutes: %ENDCOLOR%

Ruth reported that the Council had asked after our last meeting that the Executive Team identify help for DZERO with the efficiency issue (see link to Email above). Currently, the OSG Storage Group is involved in looking into this. Expect to identify individuals from troubleshooting and DZERO in the near future as more understanding develops through the storage contact. ATLAS has proved several sites with storage for to help out. Ruth will be talking to CMS about his request later today. Joel Snow of DZERO is proviing weekly reports to OSG. Concerns continue regarding the efficiency and throughput.
---+++ Round-Table VO Reports and Issues - Ongoing Goals/Milestones

%BLUE%minutes: %ENDCOLOR%

*Rob Quick (GOC):* In the month of June, OSG 1.0, RSV and the OSG Information Management Planner were all released. It was a busy month with lots of accomplishments. These were done while maintaining the ticket load at a fairly constant level.

*Lothar Bauerdick (CMS):* CMS challenges are over and process running under way.

*Brad Abbot (DZERO):* The issues with efficiency continues. In fact, the trend for number of jobs completed per unit time has been dropping recently. They are still keeping up with goals but this continues to be a problem.

*Craig Stewart (Indiana):* No longer on the call.

*Scott McCauley (Indiana):* No longer on the call.

*Ann Chervenak (ISI):* Big news this month is the release of Globus 4.2. Globus team held meeting with OSG to discuss the incorporation of Globus 4.2 in both the VDT and the OSG. Expect to be ready to move forward on this as the needs of the OSG identify.

*Kent Blackburn (for Patrick Brady-LIGO):* LIGO has continued to advance the running of Einstein-At-Home jobs on the OSG. Since the beginning of the year, Grids in the US and Europe (DGrid specifically) have contributed more cycles towards completed jobs (known as credits) than any other single source of computing available to Einstein-At-Home. There is currently a push for new development and associated debugging for the code base which will result in a near term drop in the number of jobs, but expect to continue once development cycle comes to closure and may even reach a new throughput peak as more ws-gram sites appear on the OSG.
