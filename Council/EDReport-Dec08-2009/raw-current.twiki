---+++ Executive Director Report Nov 9th 2009


Usage of OSG remaining has has maintained at a high level.Usage by the Engage VO continues to be maintained at the early summer levels for most days (see attached)

The OSG had no significant issues when the LHC started up. We are continuing to work with the WLCG Operations team on the Alarm Ticket dispatching for US ATLAS. 

This week there will be another joint OSG-EGEE-WLCG design meeting at CERN. We will discuss the EGEE to EGI-Inspire/EMI/Roscoe transition as well as storage and software issues. We have written letters of &quot;Commitment to Collaborate&quot; for these three proposals - [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=915]]
 
OSG and ESNET held a joint workshop in 2 parts: first to discuss the principles and architecture of the ID management infrastructures on the table and the second to solicit VO input. There is a report in draft form and a list of action items for the OSG coming out of this meeting. All VOs regarded the discussion as very worthwhile.
Initial actions are to:
   * Help VOs in their interaction with the IGTF for CA certification. LIGO is the first customer for this
   * Have a template and help list for VOs interfacing with the IGTF and other certificate organizations. 
   * Ask VO contacts for their 5 top security concerns. This is in progress. 
   * Address &lt;b&gt;Usability&lt;/b&gt; at the same time as Security in all activities. The ED has suggested renaming the Security as the &quot;Usability and Security&quot; Officer/Team. This is in discussion across the Executive Board, with input from the Fermilab Security Team. The ED gave a period of 6 months for thinking this through. 
   * Follow up discussions with SBGrid and CompbioGrid on their specific security needs. There will be a published statement about use of group accounts where the individual user is traceable - which is allowed by the OSG AUPs. 

The contact for all these is the security team through the security officer.  maltunay@fnal.gov

Brian is working with Miron and the Executive Team on the display of OSG usage for DOE ASCR. There is a first draft in progress which will be sent to the Executive Board soon and to the Council for review by January. 

Dan will report on the start of the &quot;Adopt a Cluster&quot; Satellite project.  Ruth attended the kick off of the &quot;100 Gigabit research and testbed&quot; projects at SC09. One of the research projects is an OSG satellite. Haifeng Wu has posted a couple of papers of preparatory work in the document repository.

There have been no major incidents. 

*Science Advisory Group*
The Introduction to OSG, the NSF Annual Report and a sample of current metrics were sent to all members of the SAG.
We have initial feedback from Thomas Ullrich and Jack Dongarra. All input will be summarized over the next month or so.
