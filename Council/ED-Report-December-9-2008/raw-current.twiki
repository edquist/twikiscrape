Executive Directors Report Dec 10th 2008

The Executive Team has started its preparations for the review. We are planning a dry run  - with a couple of &quot;mock&quot; reviewers on 8th January. We have not received a final charge. The draft charge has four sections, with the following people responsible for each section:

   * Scientific and Technical Merit of the project - Frank, Torre,  John McGee, Abhishek
   * Appropriateness of the methods and approach  - Alain, Mine, Rob G, Rob Q
   * Competency of the OSG&#39;s personnel and adequacy of the proposed resources - Chander, Kent, Paul
   * Performance - Miron, Ruth, Brian, Jim

The usage on OSG has been sustained at &gt;20,000 CPU days/day over the past two weeks. 

I attach a section of the &quot;Value of OSG&quot; paper we are working on, for discussion at the meeting tomorrow. It is going slower than we hoped and we are looking for a few members of the Council to help review and comment on this for us over the  next 3 weeks.

We submitted a section to a book on &quot;experience with production grids - concepts and patterns&quot; being edited by LSU. It is  attached as well as available in the document repository. While the text will be significantly rearranged and massaged, the section as is being useful for internal communication.

We have extracted specific text  related to OSG from the document being presented by Lisa Childers tomorrow. If you are interested in receiving this before the meeting please contact me directly.
