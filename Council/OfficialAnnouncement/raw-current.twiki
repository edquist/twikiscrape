Should you be unable to cast an email vote during the official voting period, the rules provide that you have the option of casting your vote by phone.Please let us know if you need to do this so we can arrange the required conference call.

Should you choose to delegate your voting rights to another member or to some other person, you must inform the election administrators or the Council via email stating this choice upon the opening of the voting period.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

Paul and Rick
