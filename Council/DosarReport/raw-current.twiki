---++ DOSAR Report: Horst Severini

   * we&#39;re still working on validating BOSCO -- I&#39;ll get back to that next week again, after this ATLAS Software Week is over 
   *  we are working with LaTech to get their compute resources &#39;grid-ified&#39;, so they can start running ATLAS MC on them. 
   * We&#39;re also trying to convince OU folks to adopt BOSCO, but that&#39;ll require some work, since people are used to logging into the OSCER cluster and submitting their jobs there, but we&#39;re trying to teach them that BOSCO would make their lives easier! Except for those people who have Windoze desktops -- of whom I&#39;m afraid unfortunately there are many -- who are on their own. :)
