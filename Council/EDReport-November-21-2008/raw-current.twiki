Executive Directors Report Nov 21st 2008

I would like to bring to your attention recent presentations to the APS Division of Nuclear Physics, by Frank Wuerthwein http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/0007/000786/001/dnp-2008.pdf and to the US LHC Joint Oversight Group by Chander Sehgal http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/0008/000801/001/OSG%20LHC%20JOG%2031Oct08%20v4.pdf 

Two productive OSG workshops were held in the past two weeks:

At the site administrators workshop http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&amp;confId=2184
more than 10 administrators installed both Compute and Storage Elements on the fly. There were demonstrations of new operational security tools for certificate management and user banning. There were more than 35 attendees.

The first external software providers workshop  http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=2209
brought together technical leads of many of the software development projects contributing to the OSG. The  software tools group discussed their work, the interfaces and interactions with the software development projects, and specific issues with security and incident response. About 14 people attended. 

Several of the OSG project staff were at SC08 and participating in workshops, presentations and exhibits: http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Supercomputing 

I have sent the attached letter of appreciation to the director of the SBGrid project – Piotr Sliz. Both SBGrid and OSG plan to upload this letter as supporting material in reports about our projects. The SBGrid NSF project is outlined at http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0639193. I would like to bring to the attention of the Council a proposal to add Piotr to the OSG Council at the face-to-face meeting in March.  

I wish everyone a peaceful and happy Thanksgiving next week

Ruth
