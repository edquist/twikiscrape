   * Question re: slide 12: 
      * Q: List of issues &amp; needs on slide 12, do you have effort, who would work with OSG technical groups?  A: We are doing work in some of these areas, effort/interest in these technical discussions and interactions. Armando speaks to this----interested in collaborating, putting effort  together; collaboration CVMFS- interested for future access of data not just software distribution; 

***Short answer- contact person for these areas is Armando with Steffen as a backup***

      * Q: Gabrielle Garzoglio—want to clarify needs, concern about using remote VOMS.  Availability becomes more of a concern (tier 0) not for upcoming simulation production (Steffen)
      *  Ohio Site- OSC facility, facility started by Physics faculty= not totally sure. Gabrielle, working directly with infrastructure people.
      *  Richard- SLAC hardware:  In terms of hardware, all batch farm, any capacity dedicated to SuperB is already accessible to OSG subject to any limits on no-Atlas jobs that get run. Atlas can expand into any fraction including 100% of batch farm, even if SuperB has dedicated batch resources, will only change the way in which priorities get worked there. SuperB requires outgoing internet access from worker nodes—something SLAC batch farms do not provide---worked from SuperB perspective pushing this…potential major security issues re:  way site is set up to allow this…policy issues re: way SLAC site set up. Should accommodate what legitimate applications OSG would need..
