&quot;Next Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed validation cycle is coming up. [ATLAS, CMS, LIGO], D0, CDF, Fermi-VO have plans to perform VO validation. D0 and CDF  may be good candidates for opportunistic storage&#39;s evaluation on ITB, if time permits. [ATLAS and CMS may have plans for regular storage&#39;s evaluation.]&quot;

Iwona is updating ITB release documentation for BeStMan in full mode.
Tanya is working on  BeStMan-gateway, Xrootd and gratia transfer probes. The discussion is underway how to organize ITB packaging for !BeStMan, !GridFTP and Gratia transfer probes.

---++ Seven agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Tickets

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
No tickets were entered to GOC. Andrew has been declined to get access to GOC (Tanya is trying to resolve this issue). Ted didn&#39;t have a chance to do it so far. 
The following problems/questions have been reported during last week:

   1.  Problems with vdt-dcache-SL4_32-2.2.8 upgrade at  MWT2 (reported by Charles Waldman)
      a. java will not start after upgrade - looks like some problems with symlinks - restart of dcache helped to solve the problem
      a. After the upgrade, we did &#39;/etc/init.d/dcache-pool restart&#39; on the pool nodes.  This failed to stop the running pools, and started a second Java process.  This resulted in corruption of the &#39;companion&#39; database, which took some time to repair.
      a. Nodes which are running both doors and pools are incorrectly set to NODE_TYPE=door (in node_config) instead of NODE_TYPE=custom. This results in the pool services not being upgraded/installed.
      a. A &#39;-dryrun&#39; install of pnfs resulted in a script /opt/pnfs/bin/pnfs which calls itself.  We reverted to the older version.
      a. The deprecated scripts &#39;dcache-core&#39; and &#39;dcache-pool&#39; are not removed from the runlevels. 

   1. Transfer timeouts from MWT2_IU reported by Sarah Williams - may be could be closed , it looks like it is because of pool restart problems reported by Charles
   1. Requests from ATALS (Doug Benjamin):
      a. to allow  multiple partitions for xrootd cache to be added via vdt configure_xrootd script
      a. add utilized ports list to documentation  - done
