Alex:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;

* Support
  - bestman2 2.1.0
  - Support US-ATLAS on some odd GSI from NERSC/PDSF
    -- srm-ping on some endpoints (U. Chicago and RAL, UK) fails on PDSF nodes, while the same srm-ping works on other machines other than PDSF.
       * U. Chicago had backend GUMS configuration issue after restart.
       * Could not figure out for RAL, UK, but srm-ping worked after a week. Seems to be an intermittent issue at UK side.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Status Report:
- Bestman2: 2.1.0 built with Oracle Java and put into new repository.  Certs no longer needed to build.  Java dependencies are still packaged within.
- VDT RPM transition: creating osg-discovery RPM, fixing xrootd-dsi module, reading Fedora guidelines, discussing java best practices.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Jeff:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Hadoop 0.19 -&gt; 0.20 fixes
- fixed typos when setting ganglia monitoring in hadoop-metrics.properties
- fixed status command in init script so that service hadoop status
doesn&#39;t report not running
- todo: finish updates to upgrade docs

Hadoop 0.20 Documentation
- still working on updates based on Tanya and Neha&#39;s feedback
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- reviewed https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/HadoopUnderstanding
- installed hadoop storage probe. tested that records were making to collector
- working on restoring my bestman hadoop install on cloud nodes. datanode ip 
   address was changed, so mounts on namenode had to be redone. also 
   namenode seems to have been corrupted - the hostcert/key was missing 
    and certificates directory as well
    found this out in process of installing hadoop chronicle rpm - 
    the install right now just hangs , probably will work once basic hadoop 
    installation is up and working again
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tanya: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;

   bestman2 client and server
   os-wn-client
