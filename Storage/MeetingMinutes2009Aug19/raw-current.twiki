&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
 vdt-dcache  2.4.0 release/ITB testing and what is next? (Tanya,Neha)
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We have to release a new version of vdt-dcache with fixed gratia probes 1.0.4.4d-1. Tanya will do it tomorrow. Suchandra volunteered to do a fresh  install, we should ask Steve to do upgrade on Fermi ITB. Ted can upgrade dcache on his node. We have to start to test 1.9.4-3. It looks like we should not enable ACL for now - neither US CMS nor US ATLAS expressed interest in this feature for the time being.

Tanya had meeting with Frank and Abhishek. We have agreed to the following:
   1. Michael will handle packaging - major release will come in every 6 months. 
   1. Only one release at any given time will be marked as production and supported by OSG
   1. OSG Storage will be responsible for  testing installation and core features
   1. The questions/problems submitted to OSG storage will be handled somewhat differently from the way we handle other storages: 
      a. GOC ticket will be created and monitored 
      a. CMS hadoop team (Abhishek, Brian, Michael) will be assigned to investigate the problem.

Documentation
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
