---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Bestman-gateway/Xrootd and static space tokens/xrootd &quot;used bytes&quot; script (Tanya, Alex, Wei) 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Tanya has tested &quot;used bytes&quot; script &amp; c code provided by Wei and asked Alain to include it into VDT distribution.
Alain has raised the concern that code is not a part of any release , does not have an &quot;owner&quot;  or a release version. Tanya has asked Wei to include this code with !XrootdFS release. The script will be used by  !BeStMan-gateway with underlying Xrootd. It requires xrootd libraries so it makes sense to release it together with !XrootdFS. Wei agreed but pointed out that if executed on !XrootdFS node just C executable should be sufficient (no need to have a script). Tanya will try it.

Question to Alex: When !BeStman-gateway is configured with static space tokens and underlying DFS reports that amount of used space exceeded the allocated quota  !BeStMan still proceeds with executing srm-cp command that is failing (in case of HDFS) or succeeding (in case of Xrootd). Is it possible/needed to modify !BeStMan to honor quota limitation?

from Mats:

Still trying to unpack. I starting to think that the tar/unpack approach is not the way to do this.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Brian has talked to Mats , proposed different approaches.
