---+++ Discussion


There are three new tickets.

   * UERJ - New directories in pnfs did not have tags, causing Pnfs.
   * CIT - Pinning stopped working.
   * SPRACE - cacheinfoof not working for a few files.

The first two have been resolved. Neha is working on the third one.

It was decided to use Alex Sim&#39;s SE test plan for OSG 0.8, which involves using srmtester only. We will not attempt to test implementation-specific features for 0.8. We will attend the ITB meeting today to a) Verify that ITB sites will use the VDT install scripts of dCache, and b) Determine if there are enough SEs on the ITB so the Storage Activities does not need to provide an additional one c) Present the SE test plan. Subsequent to that we will establish correspondence with the ITB SE sites to ensure responsive support.

Some of the test plan for dCache 1.8/OSG 1.0 was discussed. We settled on the items listed in Configuration as priorities

   *        -Configuration
   *              -Billing
   *              -Replica manager
   *              -Space reservation
   *                   -default to work transparently
   *                   -reserving space for OSG jobs
   *              -GIP for glue schema 1.3

with the understanding that the correct conguration of these features by the VDT install scripts is the most important metric. Also included will be client request testing, either with srmtester or S2. Alex pointed out that srmtester supports space reservation functions. Detailed test plans for each of the above items will need to be written.

Use of the new test cluster hardware was discussed. Ted reported that the SRM development group at FNAL requested that the test stand be used for dCache 1.8 S2 load testing in the immediate time frame after installation. The claim is that nothing beyond the standard install would be necesary. It was decided to support the S2 load tests under these conditions until the beginning of throughput tests with UCSD.

Tasks were assigned as follows:

   * Tanya - write test plan for Replica Manager
   * Neha - write test plan for Billing
   * Ted - write test plan for GIP for glue schema 1.3
   * Ted - begin scripts for tests and evaluation of tests
   * Neha - conduct tests
   * Michael - redeploy Billing cell on fapl046
