Installation - Ted

There is a new dCache patch 12-p5, however,  there will be a 12-p6 with some replica manager fixes. We may wait for this, depending on the timing of the release. Ted will check at the developers meeting tomorrow.

Several fixes needed to the install scripts: srm db update typo, add dropdb for replica manager, fix srmwatch install(4559), fix error reported by config-node.pl(4560), update jdk, do not install jdk if same version already installed, access postrgres through localhost only. Ted will work on these this week. Brian pointed out that the GIP will need to access the srm database remotely. We will have administrators set the permissions by hand for now.

Ted is making additions to the space manage test suite. Tanya has additions to the replica manger test suite. These will be committed this week. Installation and test suites look OK to be done by the 15th.


Probes and GIP - Brian

Found minor problems with transfer probe on fapl node, having to do with installation. Reported to Chris Green. Available space probe not tested yet. Ted will run space manager tests on GridWorks to create reservations that should get picked up by the probe. Finishing up GIP scripts. Looks OK to be done by the 15th. GIP is in production at UNL. Tanya will test on GridWorks.

Testing - Tanya

Tested RM against 12-p6 branch of code. Test succeeded but took a long time - 230,000 files on GridWorks. Will try on another dCache installation that doesn&#39;t have so many files. Will use a good fapl node.

fapl cluster is dying and will be taken out of ITB testing.

There are four functions to test in lcg-utils. This will be set at lower priority than other tasks.

Tools

Ted reported that Dmitri  Litvintsev will add code in SRM-dCache to throttle reporting of expired space reservations. Otherwise, listing them may overload the system if there are many. This will impact the space reservation cleaner tool.

Extensions - Ted

dCache srm was caching credentials by DN only. This caused problems in gPlazma when users switched from having a role to not having one. Ted will fix srm code.

Bestman - Alex

Still working on next release. Should be this week. Working with Jay Packard at BNL on adding role-based authorization.
