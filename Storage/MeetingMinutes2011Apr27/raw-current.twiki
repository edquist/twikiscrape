Tanya:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
attended doc telecon
discussed globusonline with Maxim

xrootd native packaging:
 - discussed the content of xrootd-dsi package, tested several versions, wrote installation instructions
            https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/HowToInstallGridFTPXrootd
continued testing of bestman2 2.0.10 server and client - some issues still needs to be debugged  
ran several tests between Nebraska and Wisconsin, transferring 5000 files, ~80GB. 
The times varies from 2 hours 30 minutes to 1 hours 20 minutes. Most of the tests were successful but there
 are still some issues that need to be debugged on the local hdfs installation. 

Tested bestman 2.0.10/hdfs 0.2 rpms built by Jeff. Have not encountered any problems.

Support

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
HDFS 0.2 and related software
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
hdfs 0.2 is ready for ITB testing. The release also include !BeStMan 2.0.10 and grdiftp-hdfs 0.3.1-1 (with fixes for directory listing). All rpms have been installed on gridwork cluster and tested.
Jeff will not be able to work on documentation during the next week but he will provided installation instructions for ITB testing.

---++ Second agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
!BeStMan2 2.0.10
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We are still investigating SocketException errors that have been observed during testing of !BeStMan 2.0.10 client/server. Tanya will send Alex her script so the problem could be reproduced at LBNL. At Fermilab, the  client and server are running on VMs. !BeStMan2- gateway has the default configuration and uses GUMS for authorization (tested with SAML and XACML). It looks like an exception happens during client communication with jetty. It looks like srm-lbnl client (1.3.18) gets the same exceptions but was able to recover after ~ 10 minutes.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
xrootd native packaging

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We have released xrootd-server, client, xrootdfs rpms. Doug has finished packaging gridftp-xrootd-dsi. Tanya was able to install and test it. The only problem is that globus-url-copy stops working when configuration is modified in such a way that the VMP has a different name from the xrootd storage path. Doug said that he thinks that the order should be different: redirector:port/VMP=/storage_path. Tanya will try that and if it is true we will need to rebuild rpm changing  configuration template file accordingly. 


---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dcache probes
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
The test probes are ready for testing but Neha needs to work with Phillipe to tag and rebuild the gratia source to make an official release.


---++ Fifth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
globus online tests
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
New gridftp-hdfs (with directory listing) is now installed at Nebraska and Wisconsin. Tanya has done multiple transfers via globusonline.org. The results look promising but some of the issues still need to be investigated. Tanya will do a short presentation during the next VO Forum(May 5th 2pm)
