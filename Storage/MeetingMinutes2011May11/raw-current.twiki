---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
!BeStMan2.0.10, HDFS 0.2 status

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Jeff has experienced problems with his new !BeStMan server. It is up and running and there is nothing suspicious in the log. srm-ping is failing with java.io.EOFException. The client doesn&#39;t reach bestman (it least there is nothing in the logs). Tanya thought that this was happening at the jetty level and something is wrong with authentication. We have the same version installed at Fermilab but do not see any problems. Jeff will continue to debug. Suchandra is in the  process of upgrading his cluster. He has suggested to do some modifications in installation instructions.

---++ Second agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
!BeStMan/gridftp rpms
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Tanya would like to move !BeStMan rpm to the standard vdt repo. This will be useful for people who want to install !BeStMan on top of xrootd. We need to discuss it with Alain during the team meeting on Monday. We would also want to have lcas/lcmaps plugin rpm and install/configure it with grdiftp rpms. Right now gridftp server installed from vdt-rpms can only use gridmap file for authorization.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;

We are in the process of testing 3.0.4rc1. We hope that this satisfy ATLAS Tier-3 request to have multiple xrootd mount points on the same node.
We have reinstalled xrootd on the test stand and ran verification tests. Additional cluster , installed  on fermiclould, will have frm; global redirector is installed on gw014k1.
