---+++ Discussion
Discussed SRM issues/feature requests with Timur. In summary, simple and/or urgent issues will be addressed soon. Others will be put in the context of feedback from CMSSW feedback. Notes on the discussion follow; see the minutes from 1.31.2008 for descriptions.

1. Will check the code.
2. Will implement authorization for releasing reservations, later consider authz for using reservations.
3. Will likely have Replica Manager operate on files with retention policy =  OUTPUT, and space accounted for in Space Manager.
4. A known problem.
5. dCache developers will need to modify pools to synchronize control file info with pnfs. Ted will follow up with dCache developers.
9. Ted will show how to repeat the problem.
10. Brian will supply more info to Timur.
11. May add regular expression support.
12. Will provide a fix for srmrm.
13. New request for limiting lifetimes of space reservations. Will consider the feature request.

Brief discussion on other OSG Storage issues.
Neha solved problem with pool installation on VDT site.
Install of SrmWatch and bug in config-node.pl script needs to be fixed by Ted.
New install.sh from dCache - should check and possibly use new features.
Trash.StoragePoolManager.conf writing for Replica Manager - no progress.
Gratia probes - bugs found by Brian, need new rpms from Chris Green.
GIP - Brian has the static script from Anand, but may need updates. Ted will follow up.
Testing - There is an lcg-utils script from GSSD. Tanya can use this for testing whether package works with VDT globus libs.
Tools - No progress due to UCSD participation in CMSSW.
Bestman - A new version for OSG 1.0 will be released next week.
