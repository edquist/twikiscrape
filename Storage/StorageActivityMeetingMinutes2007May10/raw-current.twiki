---+++ Discussion

Seven tickets were reported on. Four are active, three may be closed. From one closed ticket, a possible ambiguity in the java detection script was discussed. Neha will check the script. Correspondence on the possible use of installation scripts by the Univerisity of Michigan was reported by Ted. Later in the meeting Abhishek reported a problem with a new set of pools at UCSD. He will send a jvm stack trace to Alex.

The Gratia dCache probe was discussed. Michael reported that he will package the new module and test it. Abhishek agreed to also test the module using the package from Michael. Greg reported on the future deployment setup, which will store a site&#39;s local and external transfers in a site&#39;s Gratia database, and employ tools to forward the external transfer info to the central OSG Gratia server. Thus a Gratia server including mysql will also be installed at a storage site based on a package from Phillipe Canal. Greg described a possible modification to the billing cell in which it would write directly to the Gratia database.
