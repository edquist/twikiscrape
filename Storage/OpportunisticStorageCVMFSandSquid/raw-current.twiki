CVMFS is a fuse-based filesystem that turns accesses into http requests
from a central server and cached locally by squid.  It is built into
[[http://cernvm.cern.ch][CernVM]]
but it can also be used outside of it.  Here are general conditions under which
it may be a viable solution for opportunistic storage on the OSG:
   * Write only at central server, read-only everywhere else.
   * Public data that doesn&#39;t require authentication to access
   * The same subset of the data is used by many related jobs at a site.
   * Each job set uses less than around 50GB at most (at 50MB/sec
      taking about 15 minutes to transfer it all from the central server
      so also should be long-running jobs with that much data and
      preferably spaced out over the job).
   * Files no more than about 1GB each, preferably less than 500MB to
     allow for fair sharing and avoid too much retransmission if there
     are errors.
   * Local transmission rate of copies of the data from squid to the 
     worker nodes where the jobs are running,
     a couple hundred MB/sec or less.  Figure on 100MB/sec per gigabit
     of connection to each squid, and it needs to share with other
     activity at the site.  This is assuming that each worker node has
     a CVMFS client on it so the worker nodes communicate directly 
     to squid.  Bandwidth can be easily scaled in the future by 
     increasing the number of squids and possibly arranging them in
     a hierarchy and possibly even having one on each worker node.
