---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of storage tools
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Abhishek is ready to release a new version of tools. He is waiting for Brian to send him the latest fixes. The release will be ready within this month.
Discussed the best way to release tools within  VDT framework:

   1. For time being decided to release within vdt-dcache because of the following reasons:
      a. all current tools are for dcache, so it is logical to release them with dcache vdt cache
      a. the tool kit is packaged as rpms, so it will require min work  to incorporate them into vdt-dcache installation procedure because it deals with rpms already
      a. most of tools may be used only by storage admin
   1.  All new tools relevant to BeStMan should be packaged under common VDT infrastracture
   1. If we decide to move dcache to common VDT infrastructure we will move tools as well 
---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of gratia probes
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Brain said that it looks like the problem he has found was fixed by Andrew. He would like to have officially build rpms in order to test it. Tanya will talk to Andrew and Chris.  After the test we should request to include into next VDT release this new version.

Brian wrote some classes that allow to extract information from dcache Information Provider to GIP, he will share his code, so we can used it while updating dcache storage probe (it should talk to InformationProvide too).
