---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
AHM 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Brian:  people expressed great interest to HDFS. CMS  has organized the HDFS workshop immediately after the AHM  and there are  4 sites that now have !BeStMan-  
gateway/HDFS installation. Brian was sure that CMS would officially request VDT to support HDFS and Brian is prepared to help out with this. Tanya has asked about official request and the expectation for support. Brian said that the request would be sent and he hoped that &quot;community support&quot; would satisfy CMS needs. Tanya raised her doubts. We  have agreed to talk to Ruth and Alain about that.


Alex: The presentations went pretty well. !BeStMan, !BeStMan-gateway, !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd packages have been installed during workshop. Also he was able to help to some sysadmins with configuration problems with existing installation.

ITB Testing, documentations

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Abhishek: &quot;D0 will not have time to do storage testing for ITB. CDF is planning to participate&quot;

Tanya will need to make some changes in ITB documentation based on comments she has received from ITB testers.

Brian was waiting from SLAC to test gratia transfer probes, but they have not responded  so far. So he will try to ask Iwona and Horst to do the testing so we can validate the procedure described in our documentation.
