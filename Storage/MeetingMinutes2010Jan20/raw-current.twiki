Gathered links to and reviewed and OSG twiki topics to be incorporated
in the new Storage documentation. Restructured some sections on main OSG
Storage twiki page and began writing content on that page.

For OSG Discovery Tool, in surl query added capability to check
GlueSAAccessControlBaseRule for vo match. Also added capability to
handle VO: and VOMS: prefixes in vo match and to handle input of role
rather than vo name only. Began modifying other queries similarly.
&lt;/pre&gt;
