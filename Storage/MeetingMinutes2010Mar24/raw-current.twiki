---++ Status report
Abhishek:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
UCSD Hadoop testbed is running OSG/VDT Hadoop release 1.0, disk capacity 22 TB with 15 datanodes and O(10) GridFTP servers. 
Near term goal is benchmarking and scalability evaluation. Jointly being operated and coupled with GlideinWMS and OSG Scalability area goals:

1. BeStMan scalability profiling.
2. Benchmarking and I/O profiling of HDFS (without GridFTP).
3. I/O profiling of HDFS with GridFTP.
4. GridFTP optimizations.
5. GlideinWMS scalability tool.
&lt;/pre&gt;

 Bestman2:
 we&#39;re reviewing Jetty instead of tomcat, and the release will take time.
The tomcat based bestman2 is given to Brian and Tanya, and the
functionality should be the same as before. When we decide to go on with
Jetty, it&#39;ll take some time until we get the working version out.

* Support
  - document review for bestman gateway
  - document review for bestman full mode
  - multiple user id mapping support for recursive copy case in srm-copy
- STAR
  - bestman deployment support for NERSC HPSS
  - bestman and srm-copy/ls usage support for a Chinese user

* Release
  - working on bestman2 test and packaging
&lt;/pre&gt;

Andrew is finishing up the development. Will be ready to release a new version soon. He should ask Chris to build the test version and then Neha will create and installed rpm on dcache billing node.
Brian has volunteered to install this version at Nebraska so it could be tested in production environment and realistic load.
