Abhishek:

Release documentation preparation and limited-scale scalability testing are ongoing 
at UCSD testbed. 

We are evaluating BestMan v2.2.1.3.8-2 for possible inclusion into the stable repository
for Hadoop v1 release. It is currently in testing repository.

VDT repository at Wisconsin is in good shape, but may have a small change if 
BeStMan transition is made. 

Documentation is expected to make VDT RPM/YUM install process more clear.
