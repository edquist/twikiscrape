---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
DCache gratia probes

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Dcache gratia probes are installed on several CMS Teir-2 sites and one Atlas site.
Brian has  provided links to transfer probe reports:
   * [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/facility_transfer_volume][Volume of Gb Transferred by Facility]] 
   * [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/vo_transfer_volume][Volume of Gb Transferred by VO]] 
   * [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/protocol_transfer_volume][Volume of Gb Transferred by Protocol]]

Jon Bakken tried to installed gratia transfer probe on Tier-1 - it doesn&#39;t work for two reasons:
   * postgres lib mismatch - Tanya will build all rpms with postgres 8.3.5 as well
   * CMS Tier-1 is using password file for postgres. Tanya will investigate if simple removing of password from ProbeConfig will work, if not Chris will add additional functionality: extracting password from .pgpass file

gratia gridftp probes are ready and will be released to VDT with a general probe release. 


---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
D0 Storage utilization status

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Abhishek reported that: 
   1. Florida site had temporarily blocked out D0, abruptly reducing CE slot availability and SE access. 
   1. SE related problems encountered at MWT2_IU. GOC ticket is open, work is in progress with OSG Storage. 

MWT2_IU problem has been solved. Again, the reason for failure was expired host certificate on the pool node.


---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dCache 1.9.2 release status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
dCache release 1.9.2 has been taken out from dcache.org. The reasons were:
   1. failure of  implicit storage reservation for some gPlazma authorization methods 
   1. failure to check VOMS validation causes no authorizations to succeed.

The work is underway to fix these problems. Brian has promised to contact OSG security group and discuss the status/necessity  of VOMS validation for OSG dcache installation.

Tanya has got a &quot;non-official&quot; pnfs release for postgres 8.3.5. Postgres requires changing in vdt-instalaltion script. Tanya made these changes and tested installation on the &quot;clean&quot; node. We will need to test upgrade procedure as well. We will wait for 1.9.2-x release for that.


---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Problem related to lcg-cp and BeStMan
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Patrick McGuigan reported that use of sudo change the apparent behavior of bestman in  reacting to what lcg-cp is doing.  Alex is working on making consistent  the return status code on srmMkdir when sudo is enabled or disabled. This fix will be included in upcoming release (scheduled for the end of this week).

Tanya has asked to create GOC ticket to monitor the status of this bug.
