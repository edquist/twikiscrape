---+++ Discussion


---++++ Support - Neha reported on the following tickets.

   * 4425 - Closed. Problem with 64 bit install of VDT dCache package.
   * 4467 - Closed. Failure to get the pnfs manager to start up successfully (1.8.0-9) with following in our dCacheSetup: cacheInfo=companion.
   * 4153 - Closed. Pool throws &lt;nop&gt;NullPointerException when p2p copy requested by replica manager
   * 4396 - Closed.  Port number in srm url - srmclient requires it to be explicitly specified in the url
   * 4431 - Closed. The gridftp server at AGLT2 not returning full path when a globus-url-copy is performed against it.
   * 4466 -  New. Java version of G-U-C against gridftp server at AGLT2 failing. C version works fine. 
   * 4427 - New. Link Manager crashes after upgrading to dCache-1.8. Follow up in progress.
   * 4428 - New. Attempts to use srmcp (v1 client) to copy between two (different) dCache SRM doors are timing out. As asked by Ted, he will put hostcerts on pool nodes . No update after this.
   * 4397 - dCache Low SRM write speed. User didn&#39;t have a chance to try this. He is looking at the problem at a different direction. I have asked user to notify when there is an update.
   * 4227 - No update
   * 4100-4115 - No update
   * 4207 - No update
   * 4228 - No update
   * 4246 - No update

Ted described the following feature change requests.

   * Changing file attributes from T1D1 to T1D0 should cause file to eventually be swept from cache.
   * Bugfix in SRM - &lt;nop&gt;AccessLatency and &lt;nop&gt;RetentionPolicy have default values which prevent them from being read by directory tags.
   * Have Space Manager and Replica Manager able to work on the same set of pools.
   * (note : also, allow Replica Manager settings to vary by pool group, for example, to have one set of disks retain exactly one copy of each file).

---++++ Installation scripts - Ted

Tried installation on virtual machines. Need detection of SELinux so warning message is not displayed. Also, need dCache settings to be changeable by changing site-info.def, so scripts can be used to configure dCache as well as install/upgrade it. Need to add postgres compatibility libraries for 64-bit bundles and &quot;--nodeps&quot; option to install_postgres script. SRM bugfix listed above should allow complete opportunistic storage procedure to work.

---++++ Testing - Neha

Found problem on gridworks reporting &quot;FileNotFound&quot;. Will restart pnfs. Ted reported that he has begun writing Space Manager test scripts in python. There will be new Pin Manager, Space Manager, and Replica Manager code - will not wait for all of them to begin testing.

---++++ Tools - Abhishek

Working on space reservation cleaner. Will collect tools from UNL, then other sites. Will be in contact with FNAL T1 on scripts. Ted will provide name of new contact.


---++++ Extensions - Ted

Issues RPM packing of gratia probes still being worked by Chris Green. Brian reported that once the install succeeds the probes do work. Brian is designing the web page for the storage reports on the Gratia server. CMS templates will be used, rather than Birt.

Greg is now working on the gridftp transfer accounting probe.

Ted reported that gPlazma needs a bugfix in the handling of email fields in DNs, and that the next coding for the XACML interoperability project will be a reference implementation, though it is not clear yet who will write that.

---++++ Bestman - Alex

Will provide opportunistic storage instructions this week or next. There will be a new Bestman release this week, to fix a bug in the use of a limited proxy.
