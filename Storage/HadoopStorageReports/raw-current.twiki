---+ Introduction

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ReportIntro&quot;}%

The Hadoop storage reports provides a daily report on the status and usage of your SE.  This serves as a handy tool for both site administrators and site executives.  An example report is copied at the end of this guide.

%ENDSECTION{&quot;ReportIntro&quot;}%

This guide is split into 2 parts: the probe installation/configuration and the report installation/configuration.

---+ Hadoop Storage Probe

---++ YUM Installation

This probe is currently kept in the Caltech yum repository.  Once [[Documentation/Release3/][VDT Release 3]] is completed, this package will be available from the VDT repository.  Assuming that you have installed HDFS with this, do the following on the namenode:

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ProbeInstall&quot;}%

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install gratia-probe-hadoop-storage
&lt;/pre&gt;

Updates can be installed with:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum upgrade gratia-probe-hadoop-storage
&lt;/pre&gt;

%ENDSECTION{&quot;ProbeInstall&quot;}%

---++ Configuration

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ProbeConfig&quot;}%

This RPM *does not* using Linux-standard file locations.  Here are the most relevant file and directory locations:

| Purpose | Needs Editing? | Location |
| Probe Configuration | Yes | /opt/vdt/gratia/probe/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig |
| Probe Executable | No | /opt/vdt/gratia/probe/hadoop-storage/hadoop_storage_probe |
| Log files | No | /opt/vdt/gratia/var/logs |
| Temporary files | No | /opt/vdt/gratia/var/tmp |

The RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it.  The configuration of the probe is controlled by two files

&lt;verbatim&gt;
/opt/vdt/gratia/probe/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig
/opt/vdt/gratia/probe/hadoop-storage/storage.cfg
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

---+++ !ProbeConfig
This is usually one XML node spread over multiple lines.  Note that comments (#) have no effect on this file.  You will need to edit the following:

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| !CollectorHost | Maybe | Set to the hostname and port of the central collector.  By default it sends to the OSG collector.  You probably do not want to change it. |
| !SiteName | Yes | Set to the resource group name of your SE as registered in OIM. |
| !Grid | Maybe | Set to &quot;ITB&quot; if this is a test resource; otherwise, leave as OSG. |
| !EnableProbe | Yes | Set to 1 to enable the probe. |

---+++ storage.cfg
This file controls which paths in HDFS should be monitored.  This is in the Windows INI format.

For each logical &quot;area&quot; (arbitrarily defined by you), specify both a given name and a list of paths that belong to that area.  Unix globs are accepted.

To configure an area named &quot;CMS /store&quot; that monitors the space usage in the paths /user/cms/store/*, one would add the following to the storage.cfg file.

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[Area CMS /store]
Name = CMS /store
Path = /user/cms/store/*
Trim = /user/cms
&lt;/pre&gt;

For each such area, add a section to your configuration file.

---++++ Example file
Below is a configuration file that includes three distinct areas.  Note that you shouldn&#39;t have to touch the [Gratia] section if you edited the !ProbeConfig above:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[Gratia]
gratia_location = /opt/vdt/gratia
ProbeConfig = %(gratia_location)s/probe/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig

[Area /store]
Name = CMS /store
Path = /store/*

[Area /store/user]
Name = CMS /store/user
Path = /store/user/*

[Area /user]
Name = Hadoop /user
Path = /user/*
&lt;/pre&gt;

%ENDSECTION{&quot;ProbeConfig&quot;}%

---+ Hadoop Storage Report

---++ Prerequisites

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ReportPrereqs&quot;}%

   1. A working HDFS installation
   1. A local [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationGratiaSiteCollector][Gratia Collector]] installed
   1. A Hadoop Storage Probe installed and configured to point to the local Gratia Collector

%ENDSECTION{&quot;ReportPrereqs&quot;}%

---++ Installation
This package is kept in the Caltech yum repository.  Assuming that you have installed HDFS with this, do the following on the namenode:

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ReportInstall&quot;}%

&lt;verbatim class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
[root@client ~]$ yum install GratiaReporting
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Updates can be installed with:

&lt;verbatim class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
[root@client ~]$ yum upgrade GratiaReporting
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

%ENDSECTION{&quot;ReportInstall&quot;}%

---+++ Files and Directories Used


---++ Configuration

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ReportConfig&quot;}%

This RPM uses Linux-standard file locations.  Here are the most relevant file and directory locations:

| Purpose | Needs Editing? | Location |
| Report Configuration | Yes | /etc/gratia_reporting |
| Cron template | Yes |  /etc/gratia_reporting/gratia_reporting/gratia_reporting.cron (move to /etc/cron.d) |
| Logging Configuration | No | /etc/gratia_reporting/logging.cfg |
| Log files | No | /var/log/gratia_reporting.log |

---+++ Configuration file
Copy the file =/etc/gratia_reporting/reporting.cfg= to a new filename in =/etc/gratia_reporting= (for example, =/etc/gratia_reporting/reporting_cms.cfg=).  You will do this once for every report you want to send out.

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| !SiteName | Yes | Set to the resource group name of your SE as registered in OIM. |
| database | Maybe | Set to the database section containing the login details for your Gratia Collector (a few, non-functioning examples sections are included). Installing a Gratia Collector is [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationGratiaSiteCollector][covered here]], but ask around on osg-hadoop: Nebraska will usually run these reports for you if requested. |
| toNames | Yes | Python list for the &quot;to names&quot; for the report email. |
| toEmails | Yes | Python list for the &quot;to emails&quot; for the report email. |
| smtphost | Maybe | Hostname of a SMTP server that accepts email from this host. |
| fromName | Maybe | Set to the &quot;from name&quot; for the report email. |
| fromEmail | Maybe | Set to the &quot;from email&quot; for the report email. |

---+++ Cron
Copy the file =/etc/gratia_reporting/gratia_reporting.cron= to =/etc/cron.d=.  There is one line per report; comment out all except the hadoop report.  It is the line containing =-n hadoop=.  Update the line to point at your new configuration file.

%ENDSECTION{&quot;ReportConfig&quot;}%

---+ Sample report

%STARTSECTION{&quot;ReportSample&quot;}%

This is a sample report from the Nebraska HDFS instance.
