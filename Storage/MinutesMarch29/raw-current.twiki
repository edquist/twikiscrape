---++ MEETING SUMMARY

Prior to Mark joining the meeting, Alex Sim and Bockjoo Kim reported
that the issue of monitoring and validation of SE&#39;s on the OSG has
been the subject of much activity in the Operations and ITB groups
over the past month, and a solution has been sketched out and is now
being implemented.

The first problem is that sufficient information needs to be registered
with the GOC so that site testing of SEs can be carried out.  An initial
list of 7 attributes (see below) has been identified, and Fermilab is setting up a
test SE against which the test/verification proceedure can be run.
This proceedure uses the SRM tester tool developed by Alex.  One
purpose of this initial test is to determine if the 7 attributes are
enough information to carry the tests to completion.  Other sites
wanting to participate should send their attribute informaiton to
Mark Green and he will add you to this initial test as well.

Eventually, sites wanting to register SEs will go to the GOC site and
register their SE by filling in a registration form with the required
SE attribute information.  This information will by synched with the
ACDC Dashboard at SUNY-Buffalo.  Once the SE is approved by the GOC,
the idea is that the dashboard tests will be automatically carried out
and displayed on the dashboard, much as is done for the CEs now.

In addition,  Shaowen Wang (Iowa) will be adding attributes to the Glue
Schema so that the necessary information can be gathered from an SE.

Mark Green has forwarded minutes from recent meeting in which much of
the above was discussed.

Seven Attributes:
   1 Fully qualified Host Name
   1 Version of SRM
   1 Service URL
   1 Is file overwrite allowed?
   1 the get and put paths for the SE
   1 Policy URL
   1 DN for SE

Tests currently performed by the SRM test module:
   1 Is SE alive?
   1 try to put a file into SE
   1 try to get the file from SE
   1 optionally try to remove the file
   1 if two SRMs provided, try a copy.

There was much useful discussion of all of the above, clarification, etc.

See you again in 2 weeks.
