---+++ Discussion

---+++++ Open Tickets - Neha

   * 4100/4115   gsidcap authorization bug. dCache ticket #2139. No update. Ted will investigate.
   * 4153          Pool throws NullPointerException when p2p copy requested by replica manager. dCache ticket #2107. No update. Tanya will check w/latest dCache version.
   * 4207          dCache client unable to retrieve files (from certain pools NOT all) which have replicas. dCache ticket #2144. No update.
   * 4227          srm.batch ignoring gPlazma parameters. Will try to reproduce the problem. Ted will investigate.
   * 4228          bidirectional gridftp adapter not working. No update. Abhishek will followup with Vladimir.
   * 4246          p2p transfers failing for several files in dcache-server-1.7.0-36. Possibly fixed in 1.7.0-37. Neha followed up - site will upgrade.
   * 4271          dCap transfers being suspended (~10/hr) with &quot;Pool Unavailable&quot; error. Jon suggested problem could be due to pools being busy handling the requests and not contacting the Pool Manager with in time out period. So Pool Manager thinks pools are not available. User was recommended to increase the time out period and run cron job to cancel the suspended transfers. Ted followed up - no suspended transfers in first two hours, all pools active.

---+++++ Installation - Ted
Install scripts worked on SL5, though a specific version of postgres must be used to match an rpm already present. Should look for /usr/sbin/rpcinfo if rpcinfo is not found in path.

---+++++ Testing - Tanya
dCache 1.8 on GridWorks upgraded to 1.8.0-26, now working. Used new documentation for Space Reservation from Timur. Will upgrade to production version 1.8.0-0. From Abhishek: will upgrade to 1.8.0-0 depending on production schedule.

---+++++ Tools - Abhishek
Will have a phone call this week with Ted for planning. From Ted: Started web service interface for gPlazma and Space Reservation. Discussion of whether VOMS attribute certificates would be available when using https.

---+++++ Extensions - Ted
From Greg Sharp email: space reservation cleaner ready for testing. Nearly finished with first version of space reservation probe.

---+++++ Bestman - Alex
New BeStMan 2.2.0.4 release. From email: &quot;SRM-Tester results on OSG ITB SEs are working normal, and
FNAL and BNL dCache SRM v1.1 work with srmCopy with remote gsiftp.&quot;
