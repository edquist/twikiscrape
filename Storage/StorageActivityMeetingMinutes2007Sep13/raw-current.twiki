Reports

Gregory- SRM Space Reservation Cleaner: Has script to be run by site administrators to list files in expired reservations and optionally delete them. Working on functionality allowing users themselves to list and delete their files, and VO administrators to do the same.

Neha- Wrote load testing client scripts for GridWorks cluster. Set up 10 fapl nodes to run clients. Discussion of file sizes to use, how to measure the load. Handled MIT srmcp protocol issue, above. Investigate error message in postgres install, seen at Cornell.

Tanya- Running script to check replica manager. Code included new dCache cell to query replica manager. Will deploy as cron job on fapl Storage Element. Will add dcap, etc transfers with code from enstore. Will not pursue S2 stress test package if our own load testing scripts are adequate. If so, will look into deploying S2 functional tests for use after formal S2 testing has finished.

Michael- Changed config-node.pl to have Utility domain run on SRM node.

Ted- New install scripts. Fixed df problem, Utility domain (above). Tanya reported that spaces entered during the config-node.pl dialog cause problems. Michael will investigate.
