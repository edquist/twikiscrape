---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of vdt-dcache packaging

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Neha is working on configuration conversion script. Should be done by the end of this week. Tanya has started to test the new package and have found several problems.
They should be fixed this week as well. We will need to include new pnfs rpm and gratia libs. It is unclear what version of dcache we have to include 1.9.3 is not marked as production.
We will have to discuss it with developers.

---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
gPlazma status

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
According to Ted UChicago problems have been solved with increase of gPlazma/GUMS timeouts.  Tanya has observed very weird behavior of gPlzama with xacml plugin -  authorization is performed for all group/roles that are listed in GUMS but not in storage_authz.db (no caching), this could significantly increase load.


---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Hadoop upgrade
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Andrew will install the newest version of Hadoop. The performance of gridfrp-hdfs service is really bad and we know that it was significantly improved several month ago.
He will also check if now hadoop components could start/stop with vdt-control.

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Discussion of scalability problems reported in STEP09 talks

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We know that dCache developers are working on improving scalability: delegation service, srm load balancing, async ls etc.  Similar work is taking place for BeStMan. We will need to monitor the progress.
