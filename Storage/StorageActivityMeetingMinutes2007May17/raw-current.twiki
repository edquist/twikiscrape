---++ Attending
Ted Hesselroth, Neha Sharma, Anand Padmanabhan, Xin Zhao.

---+++ Discussion
Eleven open tickets were discussed. Two were deemed closable, two need followup to determine the current state, and seven are ongoing. The topic of which binary is chosen by the java detection script was raised. Neha will add a description of the detection script to the README.

Xin Zhao asked for help debugging srmAdvisoryDelete, which is not working on his test stand. No obvious reason could be arrived at based on the conversation, so Xin was asked to send the stdout of the command to Ted.
