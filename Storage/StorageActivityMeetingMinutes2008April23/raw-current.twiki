Attending: Ted Hesselroth, Neha Sharma, Tanya Levshina, Brian Bockelman, Abhishek Rana, Andrew Baranovski

Open tickets were discussed. Ted will follow up with the developers on 4771, 4472, and 4100. Ted will work on 4772 this week. Neha will change install_postgres for 4904. This change will into the next VDT package for dCache along with dcache-server-1.8.0-15.

Tanya has been working with Greg Sharp on the dCache Gratia probes. The available space probe has been completely rewritten. It is better, but Greg is fixing a few bugs in it.

Brian stated that the dCache GIP probes could be tested by the ITB for OSG 1.0. Instructions for opening access to the srm postgres server will need to be provided; Abhishek has written some in the context of the Tools release. Discussion of using dCache&#39;s infoProvider for OSG 1.2 in place of some of Brian&#39;s code. Ted will follow up with the developers their plans for this cell. (The functionality was included in the requests by  OSG to dcache.org on the next round of development.)

Tanya reported that replica manager has been tested on GridWorks for dCache 1.8.0-14. She is using GridWorks to test the Gratia probes. Ted reported that he is using GridWorks to test lcg-utils. Neha stated that she has tested all of the new Storage Toolkit and will test the next release when it is available.

Opportunistic storage was discussed. Abhishek urged that as much ITB testing be done as possible. Ted and and Tanya (if possible) will attend the ITB meeting tomorrow. Storage sites will be asked to go through the instructions for setting up opportunistic storage. Ted will work with Neha in Steve Timm&#39;s absence on setting up and end-to-end test with the Fermigrid CE/SE combination. On testing the SE part only, there was discussion of providing a test suite vs having VOs supply client-side tests followed. Abhishek will pursue involvement of VOs as part of the User Group. Brian mentioned that CMS and D0 appear to have use cases that could take advantage of opportunistic storage. Abhishek will follow up for the D0 case.

Ted is continuing to work on compiling lcg-utils for various platforms using Metronome. The VDT build now runs on 32-bit SL4 and SL5. Up to 12 platforms may be supported. On extensions, Ted started work on  gPlazma code changes.

Bestman&#39;s new capability of authorizing through GUMS is now in testing at TTU. Support for roles is still to be added.
