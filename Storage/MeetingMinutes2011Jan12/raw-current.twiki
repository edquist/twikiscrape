---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Hadoop rpms
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Jeff  has installed mash to install and copy rpms on vdt repo node. He is still working on hadoop rpms.  !BeStMan and related packages will be updated next. Jeff has gridftp (with gridmap file) working with hdfs on his teststand. He failed to get the right mapping with UCSD GUMS. He will start working on documentation this week.

---++ Second agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
RSV storage probe and Pigeon tools
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
RSV and Pigeon have been released to ITB. Horst has reported problem with storage rsv probes due to java version mixed up. Scot is working on fixing it. Tanya has installed and tested rsv/pigeon. She has found the following problems:

   1. simple gridftp test is executed against all SE, should be performed only against Classic SE
   1. ping test for dcache shows &quot;success&quot; even when the version number of dcache is not returned. This is an indication of authorization failure.
   1. the output is ordered by SRM host name and not by Site Name  
   1. in some tests, &quot;ping&quot; test is missing and the first test is &quot;put&quot;

Doug will look into all the problems. 
---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dcache status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Suchandra  has done fresh install of ITB dcache, we are waiting for result  upgrade We can release this version in production when ITB testing is done. Neha will start working on dCache 1.9.10.
The dCache team has provided the fixes for pnfsDump problem on 64-bit node and asked Will Maier to try a new version in test environment. 

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Xrootd
---+++ Discussion
Tim(VDT) is working on rpms for new xrootd release. We need a new version in pacman cache as well. We have to implement changes in xrootd configuration. Doug should be able to help VDT team with that.

Xrootd gratia probes are failing with gratia 1.06.16b-1 common libraries. Tanya has notified Brian and Phillipe and will create VDT ticket. We should ask to be notified when common libraries are changed even if probes code remains the same.  

---++ Fifth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
BeStMan2
---+++ Discussion
We have notified site administrators about !BeStMan to !BeStMan2 transition. We need to work with ITB to package !BeStMan2 the same way as !BeStMan is packaged (include prima, transfer probes etc). Also, the changes are need in OSG client and WN client.
