---+++ Discussion

Reports were taken from each member attending.

Greg: Worked SRM Space Reservation Garbage Collector. Visited Fermilab. Started work on improvement to dCache Gratia probe. Discussion: Send probe to Chris for packaging. Will be tested by Greg at UCSD. May test at FNAL as well.

Tanya: Wrote testing scripts and specialized dCache cell for sending commands. Discussion: Will try to use jython script for sending cell messages.

Neha: Installed host certificates and dCache 1.8 on GridWorks cluster. Resolved problems with srm client. Transfers failing with unusual host name from one of the nodes. Talked with Tanya about using her test classes. Found possible bug in Billing cell. Talked with Vladimir about it. Discussion: Try using &quot;nslookup&quot; on the nodes to find the hostname problem. Can use Tanya&#39;s scripts for load, however, need more protocols in them. Michael has enstore scripts that exercise all the clients. He will work with Tanya on merging them with hers. For testing, we will have a continual load on the system, and run the tests repeatedly. Success will be when a test has passed 100% over a period of time. Ted will continue to work on getting a framework ready that will allow detection of pass/failure in this scenario.

Mike: No OSG work.

Ted: Helping Charles with LIGO ITB install (bundled postgres did not work with fedora 4, tried CE/SE on same node, pool misspelled in site-info.def, df in scripts not giving space in GB, bidirectional adapter from reading from private pools not working). Description of GSSD issue.  Found reason for &quot;no valid credentials&quot; problem on fapl cluster- no host certificates on fapl059. Discussion: gsiftp-&gt;srm copies not working for Charles or on test stand, yet srm-&gt;srm does work. It may be enough to copy the CA certificates to fapl059 to delegate credentials.
