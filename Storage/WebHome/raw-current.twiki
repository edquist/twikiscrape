The OSG Storage group has been subsumed into the OSG Software group.

For further support, use the following guidelines:
   * For problems related to installation, configuration, or running of OSG software, open a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open][GOC ticket]].
   * For general software questions, please contact osg-software@opensciencegrid.org.
   * For general storage questions relevant to OSG, email osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org for best-effort answers from the community.


The scope of OSG Storage and Data management includes:

   * *Storage Element* implementation, policy, deployment and documentation about storage areas that are accessible to the OSG infrastructure. 
      * The storage resources are of clearly-defined types (tape and disk), and flavor (permanent, persistent, transient, and volatile). 
      * Interfaces for the writing and reading of data by applications to and from storage over the grid. 
      * Policies and agreements for use of Storage Resources on OSG. 
   * *Local Storage* implementation, policy, deployment and documentation of storage accessible to the applications when running on an OSG site. 
      * Definition of the data and storage areas available in the job&#39;s execution environment. 
      * Policies and agreements for the use and management of local storage on OSG sites. 
   * *Storage Interface Definitions* with respect to interoperability of storage resources across Grids.
