Jeff:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- 6/15 - 6/22
Hadoop testing 0.19 -&gt; 0.20 upgrade
- successfully upgraded but encountered minor issues that should be easily fixed:
- if yum removes hadoop rpm from 0.19 after installing 0.20, it removes symlinks needed for 0.20:
          /usr/bin/hadoop
          /etc/hadoop
- upgrade instructions say to use /usr/bin/hadoop-daemon but this is a symlink and fails unless you envoke it with real path:
       /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh
- hadoop namenode data directories needs ownership change since daemons can no longer be started by root
- fetch-crl / osg-ca-certs didn&#39;t get upgraded with new rpms
Hadoop repository updates:
- rebuilt repo initialization rpms to include osg-ca-certs repository:
      http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/1.0/rhel5/x86_64/osg-hadoop-1-3.el5.noarch.rpm (for 0.19)
      http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/2.0/rhel5//x86_64/osg-hadoop-20-3.el5.noarch.rpm (for 0.20)
Hadoop 0.20 Documentation:
- reviewed Tanya and Neha&#39;s comments, will update this week
- 6/8 - 6/15

Hadoop 0.20 repo
- Currently testing the transition between 0.19 and 0.20 and verifying instructions here:
          https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/HadoopUpgrade

Documentation
- completed first draft of https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Hadoop20Install
- will continue to revise as needed
- update homepage with 0.20 information / links: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/hadoop.html

!BeStMan2 2.0.14 will be released by the end of this week. This will be the last version of !BeStMan2 packaged in pacman. Alex and his team are working on modification of configuration script so it is compatible with native packaging standards. There are still some issues that need to be worked out.
