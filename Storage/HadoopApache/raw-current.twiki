---+ Installation

Hadoop&#39;s HDFS filesystem provides a mostly POSIX compliant interface using FUSE.  When HDFS is mounted using FUSE, the files can be accessed using standard filesystem tools like ls, cp, and such.  Apache can make use of this fuse mount to export the HDFS files through the more common http protocol.

---++ Prerequisites

   1 This guide assumes you have already installed [[HadoopInstallation][Hadoop and configured the FUSE mount]] on the web server machine.
   1 FUSE mounted.  You do not need to run any of the hadoop services on the web server, but you do need to have the fuse mount available.

---++ Install packages

Install the web server and GUMS client (latter two are only needed for SSL authentication):

=yum install httpd mod_ssl gums-client=

---++ Basic Configuration

Create a new file called =/etc/httpd/conf.d/hadoop.conf= with the following contents:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
Alias /hadoop /mnt/hadoop/

&lt;Directory /mnt/hadoop/&gt;
        Options Indexes
        IndexIgnore favicon.ico
        IndexOptions FancyIndexing
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

You can customize the Allow/Deny rules as appropriate for your site&#39;s policies.  A stricter access control system based on user x509 certificates is described below.

---++ SSL support

Described here is just one way to enable authenticated access to the HDFS files.  This is probably the most complicated way to configure user authentication, but it allows you to control access based on a user&#39;s VO membership.

First you will need to install and configure the gums-client package on the web server.  You can install the gums client with =yum install gums-client=.  Configuration is described in the [[HadoopGratia#Configuration][Hadoop Gratia configuration section]].  Basically, if you are using SSL, edit =/etc/gums/client.properties= to reflect the actual location of your GUMS server.
Add the SSL options at the end of the =&lt;Directory&gt;= section in =/etc/httpd/conf.d/hadoop.conf= above:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
Alias /hadoop/ /mnt/hadoop/
Alias /hadoop /mnt/hadoop/

&lt;Directory /mnt/hadoop/&gt;
        Options Indexes
        IndexIgnore favicon.ico
        IndexOptions FancyIndexing
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all

        # Options below here are needed for SSL authentication
        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +StrictRequire +FakeBasicAuth
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName &quot;Restricted Files&quot;
        AuthBasicProvider file
        # Don&#39;t forget that all users must have the fake password &#39;password&#39;
        AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/http.passwd
        Require valid-user

        SSLRequire (    %{SSL_CIPHER} !~ m/^(EXP|NULL)/ \
            and %{SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY} eq &quot;SUCCESS&quot; \
            and %{SSL_CLIENT_V_REMAIN} &gt;= 0 )
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Update =/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf= to enable SSL client authentication.  An entire =ssl.conf= file is quoted below, but the important pieces are =SSLVerifyClient= and =SSLVerifyDepth=.  The =RewriteRule= is a convenient way to protect against users who accidentally type =http= into their browser window instead of =https=.

The file below assumes that your certificate and key are installed in

&lt;verbatim&gt;
/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

and that the user =apache= can read both of them.

&lt;verbatim&gt;

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Create a script called =/usr/bin/populateUsers.sh= with the following contents.  You will have to customize the script with your host DN, and update the grep statement to filter only the users that you want to authorize.  In this example, only users from the uscms pool accounts are allowed access.

&lt;verbatim&gt;
#!/bin/sh

source /etc/profile.d/java.sh

tempPasswdFile=`mktemp`
passwdFile=/etc/httpd/hadoop.passwd
cmsmapfile=/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile

mysubject=`openssl x509 -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject | cut -d &#39; &#39; -f 2-`
gums --host generateGridMapfile &quot;$mysubject&quot; &gt; ${mapfile}
userlist=`cat ${mapfile} | sed -e &#39;/^#/d&#39; -e &#39;s/^&quot;//&#39; -e &#39;s/&quot; .*//&#39;`

# Loop over lines in the output, not space-separated fields
export IFS=$&#39;\n&#39;

for user in ${userlist} ; do
    htpasswd -b ${tempPasswdFile} &quot;${user}&quot; password
done

cp ${tempPasswdFile} ${passwdFile}
rm ${tempPasswdFile}
chmod 640 ${passwdFile}
chown apache. ${passwdFile}
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

The script should be run from a cron job at least once per day to make sure the list of VO members is kept up to date.  This can be done by doing the following in a shell as root:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
echo &quot;5 */12 * * * root /usr/bin/populateUsers.sh&quot; &gt; /etc/cron.d/populateUsers
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
