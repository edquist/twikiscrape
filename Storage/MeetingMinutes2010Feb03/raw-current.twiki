Abhishek:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Due to problems with codeforge used by LBNL, there was a mismatch of 
packages  in  the previous version 2.2.1.3.8. We are now going to test newer 
version of Bestman 2.2.1.3.10  

Installation of 2.2.1.3.10 and basic ping, ls, copy work. Stability evaluation 
at UCSD is set to start.

We have moved 2.2.1.3.10 into Stable Repository, and are going to include it 
in OSG-Hadoop v1.

UCSD Testbed is 1.4 TB, and will be extended to ~7 TB. 1 namenode, 1 SRM, 1 GridFTP 
and 3 to 15 data nodes (two 32 bit, others 64 bit).

YUM repository for OSG-Hadoop v1 is near final -
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/ or http://vdt.opensciencegrid.org/hadoop/

&lt;/pre&gt;

For OSG Discovery Tool, modified all queries to search on VOMS role as
well as VO. 
Added capability for searching on multiple attributes of the
same name in the same element, which ldap allows but xml does not. 
Added query to show OSG software version per cluster and site. 
Added similar query to show operating system version. 
Added capability to produce columnar and html table output. 
Added support for quote-delimited parameters. 
Fixed parsing problem when union operator is used in xquery.

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Public storage
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Fly&#39;s Eye - work has not been  started yet. Chris has necessary information.

SCEC - meeting with Gaurang, continued negotiation with U Florida

Public Storage discussion with CMS T2: not a lot of enthusiasm from site admins for getting a new storage depot, more positive response for adding new disks or srm server to existing SE. 


---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dcache storage probe
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Ready for testing. Discussed how to streamline process of releasing the probes. Andrew, for sure, should be able to have &quot;production&quot; environment on his computer in order to test.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
DMS discussion 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We are getting more question from VOs how to do managed file transfers. It looks like FTS is too heavy for what people need, RFT seems to be better solution but is not supported by Globus anymore. Should we look at PhedEx and see if it could be used in general case?
