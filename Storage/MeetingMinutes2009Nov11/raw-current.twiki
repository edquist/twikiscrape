---++ Status report
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;

Andrew:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
created transform that produces dCache topology and generates usage
statistics for pools, linkgroups, reservation descriptions and overall
space.
created program that builds python gratia records using XML output of the above.
the latter needs to be integrated with gratia connector

&lt;/pre&gt;

Abhishek:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
no report 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ted:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
For discovery tool:

made fixes to make attribute comparisons non-case sensitive and to allow functions in xquery variable declarations.
Modified the maven build to produce a product for either the release branch or the trunk. The former has 
its version identified with format x.x.x and the latter has its version identified with format x.x-rxxx, 
where xxx is the svn revision number. 
Also added a version variable in the readme text which is replaced by the true version number at build time. 
A new change log has been added with the same feature. The xpathsearch jar, based on the java code of the tool,
has been given it&#39;s own version number, since a new discovery tool version might be based on changes 
to non-java files, such as xqueries. Will likely add a version variable to the query scripts, 
so that a --version flag could be honored.

Looked at Complex Event Processing as a technology for a diagnostics tool.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
implemented new pool creation/addition mechanism.

added support so that dcache can be started as non-root

on dCap and FTP doors only, the file permission checking can now be done by PnfsManager. 
To enable it, following has to be set in the config/dCacheSetup file  
permissionPolicyEnforcementPoint=PnfsManager so, i added support for it in our conf file and script

investigated implication of pnfsManager option &quot;-storageinfo-provider&quot; no longer being supported

validated the fresh 1.9.5-5 install on fg0x1, investigated problems bringing up srm

 followed up and maintained osg storage tickets
&lt;/pre&gt;
