---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dCache tickets/issues  at MWT2
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Sarah had listed the following issues:

   1. dCache problems because of the packets lost - working with network group no need for storage to be involved
   1. intermittent rsv probe failure (goc ticket: https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=6420) - solved , Sarah has promised to sent additional information
   1. About 1% of srm write transfers at MWT2_IU and MWT2_UC fail with &quot;No write pools configured for..&quot; - the reason is still unknown, happens under heavy load, increasing debug level doesn&#39;t help. Sarah will try to investigate if this could be also related to packets  lost. Tanya will try to reproduce it on test stand (Could be tricky because we have already upgraded to 1.9.2-4)
    1. Poor performance of xrootdfs  during stress test. Sarah was creating files using xrootdfs directly. There were multiple timeouts. Tanya said that it looks like a known problem and GridFTP - Xtoortd (that is uisng DSI lib) should be used for file transfer. She will contact Wey to get some clarification about reasonable xroodfs performance.  
    
---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dCache 1.9.2-4 release 

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

We have to replace pnfs rpm once more because it is still has dependency on zsh rpm. It should be ready for Steve Timm to upgrade Fermi ITB SE. 

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
BeStMan teststand 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Teststand for BeStMan is installed and configured consists of 5 nodes:

2U dual Intel Xeon Quad Core X5450 3.0Ghz 12M 1333Mhz Rack Server


They have been configured to have 4 VMs per each physical node with:
2 CPU 3.0 GHz

213G disk

2026Mb memory

The names are:

gw0[14-18]k01 - SLF5.2

gw0[14-18]k23 - SLF4.7

We will install !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd, !BeStMan and !BeStMan gateway on these nodes,

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
D0 and CDF status

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Abhishek&#39;s report:

&quot;D0 - D0 had a very productive week (peak in 2009). Almost 140,000 to
160,000 wall hours per day with 8.4 million events produced. Known SE
efficiencies - MWT2-IU  0.473, UCSDT2  0.969, UNL  0.513, MSU 0.988,
Purdue 0.258.

CDF - No new update from CDF in usage of opportunistic storage. Caltech
(Production CMS T2) SE is in midst of provisioning storage for both D0
and CDF. Related configuration was performed, but space reservation
failed; possibly due to problems in SRM SpaceManger; will refer Caltech
team to osg-storage for further investigation.&quot;

Follow-up question:&quot; Why storage efficiencies is so low for MWT2-IU ,UNL  and Purdue? Is it site problem or d0?&quot;

Abhishek&#39;s answer:

&quot;A mix of both. There can be 2 factors: (i) dCache can have intermittent transfer failures at a high throughput of incoming SRM requests. D0 monte-carlo generation workflow&#39;s throughput used to be very high till last year; it has been moderated quite well since then; but can sometimes exceed a specific site/SRM&#39;s stability. (ii) Another factor can be missing files or offline pools.&quot;

Brian has mentioned that they have a special BeStMan-gateway server dedicated to D0 and it was hang several times during last week. He mentioned that it is possible BeStMan problem that he discussed with Alex outside of the list. Tanya has asked to be included into discussion.

From Abhishek:

&quot;After a campus security incident at a local
system, the build/development testbed is not fully established yet.
System and networking are now up; waiting for campus IP release from
blocked list. Likely to be this/next week.&quot;
