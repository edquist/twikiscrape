---++ Status report
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Alex:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
* Support
  - support for STAR data delivery from PDSF to BNL via bestman full mode
    for the completed 15,600 jobs (89.4% efficient), which 
    produced ~10TB data, 3M events from ~465,000 hours cpu at PDSF/NERSC
  - Follow-up with EMI SRM security discussion items
  - Working on source release of the bestman2 pkg
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- RSV/Pigeon: Still in ITB cycle.  Pending some gratia changes.  
      Looks to be released soon.
- Documentation: Pigeon RSV done, pending release.

Jeff:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Hadoop RPMS:
- requested michael to copy bestman rpms to testing yum repository. 
He copied over bestman-2.2.1.3.18-1.el5.noarch.rpm and bestman2-2.0.5-1.noarch.rpm but not 2.2.1.3.16 or 2.0.3. 
 I asked why those didn&#39;t make it and am waiting for a response.

AHM tutorial:
- reviewed Hadoop install tutorial and sent Doug a summary of issues I encountered for reference

Documentation:
- opened GOC ticket for twiki authorization problem, and it is resolved. 
  It says I am logged in as a guest user but I can still edit as JeffDost.  This is a known bug but won&#39;t affect editing.

&lt;/pre&gt;
