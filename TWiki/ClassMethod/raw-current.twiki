A ClassMethod is a method that must be called relative to the containing class object. This normally only applies to the =new= method used to create new object instances. For example,

---+ package Telecoms
---++ ClassMethod new()

&lt;verbatim&gt;
my $mobile = new Telecoms();
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
or
&lt;verbatim&gt;
my $mobile = Telecoms-&gt;new();
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
