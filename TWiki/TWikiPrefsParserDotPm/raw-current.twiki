---+ Package =TWiki::Prefs::Parser=

This Prefs-internal class is used to parse * Set and * Local statements
from arbitrary text, and extract settings from meta objects.  It is used
by TopicPrefs to parse preference settings from topics.

This class does no validation or duplicate-checking on the settings; it
simply returns the recognized settings in the order it sees them in.
