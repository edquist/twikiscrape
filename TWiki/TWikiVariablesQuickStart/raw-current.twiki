TWiki Variables are names that are enclosed in percent signs =%= that are expanded on the fly. Some variables take arguments, such as =%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE%=. For those variables, the arguments are included in curly braces ({ and }).

| *Variable* | *In brief* | *Full documentation* |
| =%&lt;nop&gt;TOC%= | Automatically generates a table of contents based on headings in a topic - see the top of this page for an example. |VarTOC |
| =%&lt;nop&gt;WEB%= | The current web, is &lt;b&gt;&lt;nop&gt;%WEB%&lt;/b&gt;. | VarWEB |
| =%&lt;nop&gt;TOPIC%= | The current topic name, is &lt;b&gt;%BASETOPIC%&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;!-- using BASETOPIC instead of TOPIC for the example because this document is normally included in TextFormattingRules --&gt; | VarTOPIC |
| =%&lt;nop&gt;ATTACHURL%= | The attachment URL of the current topic. Example usage: If you attach a file to a topic you can refer to it as =&lt;b&gt;%&lt;nop&gt;ATTACHURL%/image.gif&lt;/b&gt;= to show the URL of the file or the image in your text. | VarATTACHURL |
| =%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{&quot;SomeTopic&quot;}%= | Server side include, includes another topic. The current web is the default web. Example: =&lt;b&gt;%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{&quot;%TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap&quot;}%&lt;/b&gt;= | VarINCLUDE |
| =%&lt;nop&gt;SEARCH{&quot;sushi&quot;}%= | Inline search showing the search result embedded in a topic. FormattedSearch gives you control over formatting, useful for creating web-based applications. | VarSEARCH |

   * *Colored text:* Write: =%&lt;nop&gt;RED% Red %&lt;nop&gt;ENDCOLOR% and %&lt;nop&gt;BLUE% blue %&lt;nop&gt;ENDCOLOR% colors= to get: %RED% Red %ENDCOLOR% and %BLUE% blue %ENDCOLOR% colors.

There are many more variables. To see them all, go to *[[TWikiVariables]]*.

*Documentation Graphics:* There are many graphics available to use in your topics. Use =%&lt;nop&gt;ICON{&quot;help&quot;}%=, =%&lt;nop&gt;ICON{&quot;tip&quot;|%=, and =%&lt;nop&gt;icon{&quot;warning&quot;}%= to get: %H%, %T%, and %X%. To see all of the graphics available, see TWikiDocGraphics.


%ICON{&quot;tip&quot;}% To &quot;escape&quot; a variable, prefix it with an exclamation mark. Write: =!%&lt;nop&gt;SOMEVARIABLE%= to get: !%SOMEVARIABLE%.
