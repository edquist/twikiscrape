---++ About Google Analytics
[[http://www.google.com/analytics/][Google Analytics]] is a free statistics tool to track website visitors. While this service is especially meant to measure the effectiveness of !AdWords, it can be used for any site.

Google blurb:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Google Analytics offers a host of compelling features and benefits for everyone from senior executives and advertising and marketing professionals to site owners and content developers.

Learn how visitors interact with your website and identify the navigational bottlenecks that keep them from completing your conversion goals. Find out how profitable your keywords are across search engines and campaigns. Pinpoint where your best customers come from and which markets are most profitable to you. Google Analytics gives you this and more through easy-to-understand visually enhanced reports.
