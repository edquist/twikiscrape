Use the &quot;Minor changes, don&#39;t notify&quot; checkbox in preview in case you only make a minor change to a topic and you do not want to inform everybody who is on the WebNotify list of the current web of this change.

__Note:__ No new revision is created in case you save the same topic again within a certain time frame (default is one hour). You only need to checkmark the &quot;Minor change, don&#39;t notify&quot; checkbox once within this time frame, because subsequent save operations do not notify users.

__Note:__ The initial state of the checkbox can be set to on with the =DONTNOTIFYCHECKBOX= preferences variable. See TWikiPreferences for more.
