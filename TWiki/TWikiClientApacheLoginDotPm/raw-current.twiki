---+ Package =TWiki::Client::ApacheLogin=
*extends* &lt;tt&gt;[[TWikiClient DotPm][TWiki::Client ]]&lt;/tt&gt;


This is login manager that you can specify in the security setup section of [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%][configure]]. It instructs TWiki to cooperate with your web server (typically Apache) to require authentication information (username &amp; password) from users. It requires that you configure your web server to demand authentication for scripts named &quot;login&quot; and anything ending in &quot;auth&quot;. The latter should be symlinks to existing scripts; e.g., =viewauth -&gt; view=, =editauth -&gt; edit=, and so on.

See also TWikiUserAuthentication.

Subclass of TWiki::Client; see that class for documentation of the
