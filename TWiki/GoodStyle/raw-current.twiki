---+ &lt;nop&gt;GoodStyle Collaboration Tips

   * TWiki has a very simple *[[TWikiShorthand][text formatting shorthand]]*. In any case, you won&#39;t go wrong if you simply:
      * start each line without spaces
      * separate paragraphs with a blank line 

   * Run together capitalized words to form *[[WikiWords][WikiWords]]:* 
      * WikiWords automatically appear as hyperlinks
      * make up meaningful, reasonably brief Wiki names - it can be a challenge (it&#39;ll sharpen you up!)
      * WikiWords has name-creation tips that may help

#SignAndDate
   * If a *discussion* is going on:
      * separate each follow-up with a space
      * add your WikiName and the date at the end. Example:%BR%
        =-- &lt;nop&gt;%WIKIUSERNAME% - %SERVERTIME{$day $mon $year}%=
      * OR, by all means, insert your comment where it seems to fit best:
         * you may want to inset it with a bullet and/or _set it in italics_ so it&#39;s clear (always sign and date)
      * if you&#39;d like to use an initial, use a link with label. Example:%BR%
        =-- [&lt;nop&gt;[%WIKIUSERNAME%][ZXQ]] - %SERVERTIME{$day $mon $year}%=

   * A good format for a *new topic* is &quot;dissertation followed by discussion&quot;: 
      * start with a brief, factual introduction, followed by double horizontal rules
      * let the discussion begin

   * When a discussion dies down and the page becomes static, if you&#39;re clear on your course, feel free to *refactor mercilessly*:
      * fearlessly edit down to capture the key points
      * reduce the noise without losing the facts or the flavor
      * if you merge or delete comments, group credit =Contributors:= at the end of the page
      * _This is how Wiki content matures and grows in value over time._

   * For *external site links*, you can type URLs directly into the text - =http://etcete.ra/...= - it&#39;ll be clear to anyone where they&#39;re headed on click. 

   * TWiki is intended for world-wide use, and an internationally understood date format like ==01 Sep 2003== or ==2003/09/01== is preferred. It&#39;s clearer than the xx/xx/xx format, where a date like 9/1/01 can mean either Jan or Sep, depending on the local conventions of the readers. For months, use the first three letters: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr,...

   * *TIP:* Check the source when you want to find out how something is formatted: click ==Edit== on the lower toolbar. To see earlier versions, click ==More==, then check ==Raw text format== and click ==View revision==. A bit of HTML experience can&#39;t hurt, but you&#39;ll soon see with TWikiShorthand how far that is from necessary.
