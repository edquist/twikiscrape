---++  Mine Altunay - Security
   * Distributed Computing Access through Federated identities (DCAFI): 
      * Several releases have been made to add new functionalities and enable support/integration with existing solutions on scientific production.
      * SSLv3 has been disabled in servers supporting cigetcert infrastructure.
      * Poster presented at CHEP 2016: &quot;Grid Access with Federated Identities”.
   * Operations
      * DigiCert API has been entirely disabled for OSG: https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30812
      * Vulnerabilities/Incidents:
         * Vulnerability in canl-C library; an attacker can impersonate any user of any VO supported by that service, though only with an unprivileged role. It was reported by EGI SVG and rated as “Critical”. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31295
         * Vulnerability reported in MySQL application (CVE-2016-6662). This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges and gain control of the server hosting the affected version of MySQL.
   * PKI tools is being modified to generate SHA2 Certificate signing requests (CSRs). https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2136
   * HEPCloud Risk Assessment document has been completed.
   * Brian Bockelman met with OSG Security team to solve some questions about Singularity.  We recommended replacing glexec with singularity, it is a better choice for account separation.
   * OSG Risk Assessment 2016 started last October 17th. 
      * Security surveys were sent out: GOC, OASIS, CA, Software, OSGConnect, DocDb. These security surveys evaluate the status of the security controls are that in place to guarantee Data Integrity in OSG. 
   * Upcoming meeting with Steve Tuecke about GlobusAuth.
   * Security training conducted for 3 new VOs: SPT (South Pole Telescope Collaboration), project8 (spectroscopy technique for measurement of neutrinos) and miniclean (Dark Matter).
