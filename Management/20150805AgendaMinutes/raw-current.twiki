Key Initiatives
   1. OSG Trash/Trash/Integration with Clemson. 2 Tracks of work: (1) establish submission from the local Palmetto cluster to OSG Connect to OSG: still some problems; (2) Provide a resource target to OSG Connect: now available, but still no OASIS.
   2. Planning next Software Carpentry workshop at Duke - Oct 27-29 . Planning to use Duke CI Connect system.
   3.  Internet2 Technical Exchange - Oct 4 - 8 Cleveland OH - Organizing Campus roundtable - Expect mainly senior leadership audience. Target timeline to make FreeSurfer work on OSG (brain imaging tool from Hardvard).

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Several clusters in OSG support multi-core scheduling: no good way in OSG to interface to these capabilities for non-LHC VOs. FreeSurfer community might be a good target to bootstrap this; need discussion with production support. 
   2. Same concern for GPUs, but see OSG AHM presentation for SBGrid

Key Accomplishments
   1. User School - material is of high-quality: some modules should be incorporated in the baseline documentation.
