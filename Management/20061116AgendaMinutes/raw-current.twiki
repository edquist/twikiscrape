From Kent:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
Planned Deliverables for Finance Board Meeting:

o Review/Discuss Charge (as defined in the management plan)
    - In particular Jim Yeck&#39;s role
    - Including change control responsibilities/authorities
    - How do we interact with and what are our expectations
      with External Projects
    - Who does the Finance Board report to

o Establish concrete reporting structure (email list, website,
  report templates/invoicing, chain of command)
    - Reports should be substantive (PA)
    - Web based would be good, needs password protection and
      probably the least painful (PA)

o Concrete schedules for reporting (due dates)
    - How will reporting schedule overlap with other schedules
    - Review November 30 effort reports

o Determine frequency and logistics of meetings (relationship to
  Executive Board Meetings and Annual Reports to funding agencies)

o Review of SOW, Project Plan and WBS
    - Presentation of SOW by chair
    - Presentation of Project Plan/WBS Executive Director
    - Have a standing item to review reports
    - Seek guidance from Council via chair

o Roll all this up into a Finance Plan
    - Talk to Bill Kramer to learn what he is looking
          for in a Finance Plan
    - Do we integrate into OSG Management Plan or provide a
      separate document
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
   
LIGO has weekly reporting of ~ 15 bullet items from each person that rolls up to top, quarterly reports to agency

Looks like a full agenda and will need efficiency and advance preparation , reading.

---++ Facility 
   * Operations Coordinator [[Operations.ProductionReport][biweekly Report]] -- Leigh - next one due next Monday.
      * FKW - Abishek can contribute (Leigh - he can add to the twiki directly)

---+++ Users in Multiple VOs issues
   * Recommendations for use and configuration of GUMS
      * without using voms-proxy-init &amp; GUMS users in multiple VOs should have different DN&#39;s for different VOs
      * Also an issue that VOMS servers go down at times and this impacts GUMS
      * it is necessary that same DN in multiple VOs means all GUMS servers must read VOMS servers in same order or mapping will get mixed up
      * we should make this an action item to push through ITB

---+++ Security

Note sent to security-discuss about the .eu honeypot collecting mystyped .edu domains. DP looking into it.

Will put mention of it on ops agenda for Monday.

---+++ Software
   * Status of SRM/dCache in VDT test release.
      * FKW checks weekly with FNAL on srm/dcache.  Nov. 15 target probably moving.  Nov. 22 release won&#39;t be tested yet on public/private network issues. Will know more early Dec.  Should start with only UCSD for now, and will pick another site to try next.
   * Alains question:

From OSG Project Plan 0.21 (for 0.8 release)
I&#39;m not sure what this text means at a technical level: &quot;Add first pass packaging and distribution to support VO software installation: The OSG software model is of VO scoped and managed environments on shared and opportunistically available resources. Each VO installs their application middleware in a VO specific storage area $OSG_APP. To date the OSG software stack is statically installed into a common area accessible to all VOs. In the next year we will provide collections of VDT and OSG software that will provide common modules for VOs to include in their own installations. This will set the stage for the longer term goal of dynamic &quot;on-the-fly&quot; installation of both OSG and VO software.&quot;


FKW - does not know who wants it.
