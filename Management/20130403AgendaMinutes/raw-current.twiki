Key Initiatives
   1. End-to-end user jobs in glideinWMS w/o user certificates: considering this activity as part of the id management services item in the yr1 security plan. Focusing on the OSG-XSEDE users. Completed technical assessment and all-day exercise with FE and Factory admins: the FE and Factory have the ability to track users to a worker node, given the collaboration of the site. Planning on another exercise with sites.
   2. Increasing adaption of CILogon CA. Focusing on tests at Fermilab with the goal of moving the site to production. This is considered a minor policy change, since the DN clearly notes the institution to be trusted. Commissioned single command tool to generate proxy for end users.
   3. ID Management roadmap: finalizing document by integrating final feedback.
   4. Security training for new VO

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Activities on the plan are proceeding according to schedule. No major concerns on the plan at this time.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Pakiti demo at the AHM. FermiGrid is interested to monitor their services using Pakiti. Seeking additional sites.
   2. OASIS / CVMFS security assessment completed satisfactorily. Official CVMFS deployment date at the GOC is Apr 9.
   3. Completed the risk assessment for md5 and sha1 : no major concerns, although still recommending migration to SHA2.
