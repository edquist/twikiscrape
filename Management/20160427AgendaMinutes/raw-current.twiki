---++ Dave Dykstra for Mine Altunay - Security
   Since March 2
&lt;noautolink&gt;

   1 Operations
      1 Sent out an announcement for a critical NSS buffer overflow.  Now there&#39;s another one, labeled &quot;moderate&quot; but still could cause remote code execution so it seems pretty similar to us.
      1 Replication of data from the OSG VOMs at Fermilab to the one at the GOC is not maintained.  The plan is to [[https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/29008][shut down the one at the GOC]] next month because Fermilab already has a pair of them for high availability.
   1 OSG CA
      1 Someone noticed that the new OSG CA user certificates cannot be used for signing email like could be done with DOEgrids and Digicert-grid certificates.  I found out that it was missing an &quot;E-mail Protection&quot; flag.  I asked Mine, and she said it was an oversight.  I updated our formal CA description, [[https://groups.google.com/a/tagpma.org/forum/#!topic/tagpma-general/SuvwUfUndCE][posted it]] for comments with TAGPMA, and its two week wait period is over today (no comments were received).  I will request CIlogon to implement it.  We also sent out an announcement telling people about it and suggesting they use free certificates available from the web; those only verify by email, however, so they&#39;re not a very high level of assurance.
      1 Only [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CATransitionProcedure][9 more VOs to be transitioned, next month]].  Still no response from one of the VO managers (SCDA) as of Friday.  5 VOs will not be transitioned because they&#39;re deprecated.
      1 Only minor issues have been found.  There was a problem getting a certificate with more than 18 Subject Alternative Names in one cert, which CILogon fixed by increasing the limits.  There was an overnight outage of certificate retrieval through OIM because of a problem with an update.
      1 Neha updated OSG twiki pages on getting certificates to give the info on the OSG CA instead of Digicert.  She still needs to adjust some image sizes.
      1 Jeny has made a draft and a couple of revisions of an SLA for the OSG CA.   It was discussed at the OSG AHM, but hasn&#39;t yet been finalized.  Currently waiting for comments from Rob Q which he said he&#39;d do by the end of this week.
   1 OSG AHM
      1 Security session went well
      1 Suggestion came out to start doing some more security drills, which Anand is preparing to do
      1 Anand also making sure there&#39;s another OASIS security drill (previous attempts didn&#39;t succeed and fixes have been made)
   1 Cyber and Information Security Research (CISR) conference 
      * I presented our paper on integrating federated identity with grid computing.   There was only a 42% acceptance rate, yet I still felt out of place there because nobody else was talking about grids or X.509 certificates.
   1 CILogon Basic CA certs not accepted in Europe
      1 I learned CILogon Basic CA is not currently accepted in Europe.  lcmaps is getting a new plugin to accept CAs like CILogon Basic CA (currently it is the only such CA) but only in combination with a file listing approved VOs.  This is because CILogon Basic CA supports some identity providers that do not verify the identity of their users, combined with the fact that unlike in the OSG, many of the European VOs do not verify the identity of their users either.  OSG has been able to accept CILogon Basic CA for 2 years because they trust all their VOs.  The concept of VO in Europe is closer to the OSG VO&#39;s &quot;project&quot; where most of the infrastructure is provided for them.
      1 I believe this is going to be a problem for users of CILogon Basic CA like Fermilab when they want to run jobs in Europe.  The European infrastructure for cross-checking CAs with VOs (that is, the lcmaps plugin and a mechanism for updating the VO list) is not expected to be ready for about 18 months.
      1 The problem comes whenever user certificates are sent with jobs in order to selectively access storage, as is the case for analysis jobs for many experiments.  Even if storage is only done back home where the CILogon Basic CA certificates are accepted, the remote site should run glexec to separate users so they cannot steal each other&#39;s certificates.  Glexec usually then verifies the user&#39;s certificate, although a use of pool accounts for user separation could avoid that.   I expect the WLCG traceability task force will be looking into these things.
      1 I met with Jim Basney just before this meeting to talk about the possibility of a CA with a higher level of assurance for identity providers.  CILogon has another CA called CILogon Silver CA which is fully accepted in Europe, but it requires InCommon Silver certification which is too stringent for most U.S. institutions.  Only one institution in InCommon has ever achieved the Silver level.  Jim is interested in modifying the formal description of that CA to say that it also accepts other institutions that OSG affirms do a good job of verifying users.  We would need to write a formal document saying how we approve the identity providers, get it accepted by the IGTF, and send a request to CILogon whenever we approve a new institution&#39;s identity provider.  Initially this may only be for DOE labs, but if a University is interested and they&#39;re willing to distinguish between approved and unapproved users in their IdP, CIlogon could switch between  the two levels.
       
    
---++ Dave Dykstra - Technology: OASIS

   1 The big OASIS update happened in March with only minor problems.
   1 CVMFS 2.2.2 is being released to the osg repo in May, including use of a configuration repository and osgstorage.org repositories.

&lt;/noautolink&gt;



---++ Stakeholder Request Management - Gabriele Garzoglio

https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10030

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. 9 remaining VOs to be transitioned to the OSG CA. Expect release of OSG ops SLA on OSG CA this week. Requested that OSG CA be used for signing email: CILogon needs to turn on support for it.
   2. Preparing to increase number of security drills (e.g. block user, oasis security drill). Anand working on it.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. CILogon Basic CA is not accepted in EGI. IGTF accepted it in combination with a VO that ensured identity of the members (in EU, in general there is no VO identity vetting). Working with EGI on new policy: provide a list of VOs trusted to use CILogon Basic CA because of their identity vetting processes. Designing plugin of gLExec to support this VO list (probably widely available in 18 months). Complications envisioned in the use cases involving gLExec. Exploring options to use CILogon Silver CA for OSG CA.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Presented paper on grids and x509 at the cyber and information security research (CISR) conference.
