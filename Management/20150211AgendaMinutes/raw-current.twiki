---+++ Concerns and Issues
   1. !PerfSONAR
      * Decisions need to be made on the hardware/contract options for Cassandra datastore
      * Data Store is not accurate and no one knows why
      * Data is not easy to understand
      * Data storage in Esmond is not understood
         * Along with how summary data is created and stored
      * No integration management
         * Leads to a lot of finger pointing at the other guy
      * A purge of ITB data led to corruption
      * Unknown future use-cases beyond !MadDash
         * Routing decisions? 
         * Data analysis 
   2. Service Additions Adding Up - &quot;Currently sustainable but there are limits&quot;
      * OASIS - Version 2.0 - See below
      * !PerfSONAR data store and visualization
      * !CondorCE Info Service (now in place) 
      * !XRootD Redirector
      * PKI Updates for !DigiCert contract end
      * Others?
   3. OASIS v2
      * OASIS v1 (Workplan Nov 2012 to Production for early adopters Mar 2013)
      * OASIS v2 is a packaged version of v1 with minor updates (CVMFS versions and installation scripts)
         * Workplan September 2013 - Production ???
         * Stratum-1 should reach production in March
         * Stratum-0 and Login have been close to ready for a year, I have no confidence this is true 
      * OASIS v1 is a fully production ready and stable instance
         * Functionality has been added based on user request
      * While we should strictly adhere to the &#39;dead or done&#39; timeline we&#39;ll still need a way to update functionality
         * Suggest if project reaches this deadline it be turned over &#39;as is&#39; and future updates be provided some combination of technology/software/ops teams
   4. OSG Connect 
      * Participation in the weekly Operations Meeting has dried up
      * Account Administration
      * Topology
   5. IPv6
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Sandbox/OperationsServicesIPv6CompatibilityTable][TWiki Page]]
      * Not much activity for Ops

Key Accomplishments - Communications
   1. Newsletter articles

Key Initiatives - Operations
   1. PerfSONAR - running pre-production infrastructure. Evaluating production H/W costs, including commercial hosting for cassandra DB. Data structure still needs clarifications and there are concerns about stability.

Top Issues / Concerns - Operations
   1. Growth in number of services under operations
   2. OASIS v2 slow to converge. v1 is stable and functionalities are added as per user requests.

   2. Prepared High Throughput Computing Challenge for AHM 2015
