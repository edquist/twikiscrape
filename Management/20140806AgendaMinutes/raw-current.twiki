---+++ Top Concerns

   * Many of the OSG Software team are &amp;le; 40% effort. Given the overhead of context switching, etc., our total productivitity is not the same as fewer full-time people totaling the same effort. So we are organizing work in terms of larger and smaller tasks, with bigger, more important tasks being assigned to &amp;ge; 50% staff.

   * The backlog of useful work is still significant. We are tracking overall progress and working on it, but slowly. Put another way, our rate of ticket completion is at or just slighly above the rate of incoming tickets.

   * There has been little to no effort put into documentation lately. We are shifting the responsibility for this area back to Software and will draft a plan to address missing, incomplete, and out-of-date documents. Effort will be available in September.

---+++ Stakeholder Requests

   * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/REQUESTS-62][REQ-62]]: Add extra features to GUMS (support for groups)
      * Implementation in progress
      * Part of GUMS 1.4.0
      * Hopefully in the September release

   * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/REQUESTS-71][REQ-71]]: Two !GlideinWMS support requests
      * First part (HTCondor CE-only metapackages) is in progress and should be released next week
      * Second part under review

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Year 3 new features, internal maintenance, and documentation: good progress on some projects (HTCondor CE, IPv6, EL7); not much progress on others, but not a concern yet.
   2. ITB Instance at Madison: good progress

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Fragmentation of team members leads to inefficiencies. Attempting to reorganize tasks internally.
   2. Slow progress in reducing the backlog of useful work and in documentation.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Released a polished HTCondor CE system. First integration of PanDA server.
   2. Extended testing infrastructure for IPv6 and EL7.
   3. OSG User School finished
   4. 4 releases in the last month - one high-priority due to problems with Gratia and HTCondor CE
