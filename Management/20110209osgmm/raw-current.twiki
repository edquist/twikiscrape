---+ Metrics WBS Items:

---+++ Late / unsatisfactory progress

   * 3.1.3.1 Deploy metrics at GOC: There has been good progress here, but it is later than WBS plans.  Still at least a month left, then &quot;clean up&quot; things we broke in the transition to GOC.
   * 3.1.3.6 Consistency RSV Probe: These probes were written awhile ago, and just last week were released by VDT.  Would improve the quality of our info and accounting systems if everyone used them.  However, WBS item is very vague and lacks firm deliverable/goal/timetable.

---+++ Requested WBS changes

   * 3.1.2.4 Pilot/cloud accounting: We published [[Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics/PilotAccounting][a strategy last year]].  No effort to execute.  What should we do with this?  I&#39;m fine with stopping here.
   * (NEW) RSV-Reports update: Task that should have been recorded on WBS for Jan 1 - 30.  Remove external dependency for RSV-Reports, making them more reliable.  Finished.
   * (NEW) OSG.org usage graphs: I would like to spend time cleaning up these scripts for !FermiGrid, similar to the RSV-Reports effort.
   * (NEW) Re-validation of the correctness of the monthly thumbnail reports.  These have not been validated in awhile, and utilize external data sources - we should make sure those data sources are being used correctly.
   * ??? Validate HTPC: From a metrics point-of-view, the end-to-end HTPC accounting data has not been validated.  Should this be metrics effort?

---+++ Things we&#39;re not overly concerned about

   * 3.1.2.1 Gratia liason: Gratia project is effort-limited.  [[Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics/GratiaLiason][We have the prioritized list of tasks here]].  Plan is to continue with what effort we have.
   * 3.1.2.3 Gratia reports: Progress is satisfactory.  Reports are more robust to install and no longer OSG-centric.  Only reason to keep this task open is future, unknown development tasks
   * 3.1.3.2 Normalization constant collection: Progress is satisfactory; constants continue to be recorded and webpages updated to remove KSI2K as possible.
   * 3.1.3.3 and 3.1.3.7 Monthly reports: We&#39;ve had issues with the WLCG changing schemas without warning, making automated error-catching difficult.
   * 3.1.3.4 and 3.1.3.5 Current engineering for metrics displays: No large tasks.
