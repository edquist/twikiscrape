   * Need to do some STAR software updates and configuration to have the right versions and db access for a useful run.
   * Will test Lavanya&#39;s virtual cluster launching procedure in next few days
      * goal is to instantiate an OSG CE to accept normal grid jobs and Torque batch system
      * will be doing some testing of data handling to see what is most effective
   * Thanks to valuable efforts from Matt, Jan, Iwona, Lavanya, ...
   * Also an activity going on to use Kestrel workflow system possibly combining nodes from Magellan and Clemson
   * Have a target of running the Fast Offline workload early in 2011
