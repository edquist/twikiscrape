Key Initiatives
   1. South Pole Telescope on track. Software repo in OASIS. Setting up local analysis infrastructure at the south pole and MWT2.
   2. FreeSurfer execution service - scope increased, but service is stable and scalable. Need final scale test with 450 MRI workflows before release to production.
   3. Quick connection service for Stanford in production; low maintenance effort
   4. stashcp - code has been cleaned up and released; now tested delivering 1 PB of data. It lowers failure rates in data access with respect to a month ago.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Lack of opportunistic compute resources for the OSG VO. LHC experiments have ramped up and opportunistic cycles have diminished. Observed good correlation: when CMS submission was down, OSG and GLOW VO usage was up.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Xenon1T on track. OSG participated in computing workshop. Integrated Pegasus for MC; validating large scale (10M events) processing on OSG. Rucio fully integrated and in production. Facilitated membership in LHCONE to use transatlantic ESNet links.
   2. OSG User Survey to understand usage of OSG. Unanimous satisfaction with User Support team response to user issues. OSG is very important or essential to 75% of the 49 respondents. 26% heard about OSG through a workshop or training event. Many respondents were not aware of certain tools that might benefit their research. Common factors that prevent/limit OSG usage (jobs too long, too memory-intensice, ...), with 47% saying that “Nothing” is limiting their use of OSG. See slides for preliminary report.
