      * CVMFS (to support OASIS)
      * SLURM (alternative batch system)
      * HTCondor-CE

   * *Testing*
      * Automated tests: Improve and expand coverage
      * Manual tests: Document test cases, expand pool of testers, better define process

   * *VO Data Distribution*

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Effort, Effort, Effort*
      * Effort available from OSG Software team developers and testers
      * Tim’s effort and responsibilities
      * Effort available from ITB and other contributors (i.e., volunteers)
      * Working on hiring at UW–Madison; in progress, no clearly outstanding candidates, takes effort (!)

   * *Reactive vs. Proactive Work*
      * Related to lack of effort
      * Taking steps to improve processes and prioritization
      * Working closely with %RED%Technology%ENDCOLOR%, Production, Project Management, and Operations areas
      * Need to coordinate better with BOSCO effort

   * *Slowed or Delayed Projects*
      * Documentation: Affects end-user experience
      * Testing (see above): Affects end-user experience
      * Configuration management: Affects end-user experience
      * Debian support: Affects who can use OSG Software
      * Non-RPM worker node: Affects who can use OSG Software
      * Community packaging, especially w.r.t. EPEL: Affects effort

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

   * *&gt; 50% Deployment of OSG Software 3 (RPMs)*
      * As of 6 November 2012: 56 sites using OSG 3, 49 sites using older (OSG 1.2, except for one)
      * OSG 1.2 deprecation notice sent to sites
      * No broad, major blockers to deployment

   * *Releases*
      * Since last Software report (8 August):
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release318][3.1.8]]: Condor security update, other bug fixes
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release319][3.1.9]]: Many updates and fixes, including GRAM blockers
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3110][3.1.10]]: CA certificates, mostly
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3111][3.1.11]]: VOMS, VOMS Admin, CA cert updater, Digicert, Condor, Java, etc.
      * Aiming for about one per month

   * *SHA-2 Support*
      * Most testing completed, most software is fine
      * Wrapping up support for SHA-2 in !BeStMan and !jGlobus, which was a major concern
      * Need to start pushing on software providers to further certify their software

   * *Transition to Tim*
