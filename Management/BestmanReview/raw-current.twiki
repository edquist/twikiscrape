1.30pm - 5.30pm  on 13th September  2011 at the Gleacher Center in  downtown chicago at the tail end of the XROOTD workshop.

8.30 am - 12.30 pm on 14th September 2011 at Searle Chemistry Laboratory, Room 240B, 5735 S. Ellis Ave

 Location logistics are at http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=149453. 

---++ Scope and Charge

The scope and charge of the assessment is to: Execute a comprehensive review, constrained by the time available during the review meeting, of the Bestman software for maintenance, update, and support for the next 3 years for the known usage by OSG stakeholders.

---++ Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment report 

   * Results of the demonstration that OSG personnel can rebuild, make a distribution, install and use the latest Bestman release from source in the SVN at Wisconsin or from an open source repository such as  Sourceforge on the currently supported VDT platform SL5 as well as one other platform of interest to the OSG stakeholders. 
   * The list of existing requests from OSG stakeholders to the Bestman team for software enhancements and an understanding of their priority and effort that would be required to complete them by the existing s/w team. (I will work to pull this together). 
   * Results of an exercise to find and fix in the code a security  vulnerability or other problem that will be “artificially identified”. 
   * The need for and resource estimate that would be needed to port the code to Java 7. 
   * Itemizing the current use cases of Bestman by OSG stakeholders and software providers. 
   * An estimate of the skill set, ramp up and sustained effort needed (assuming the basic skill set already exists in the personnel doing the support) for continued maintenance and support of the Bestman component for existing OSG stakeholders and software providers.


The assessment will be an open process with the results available to the Bestman software team as well as the OSG Executive Team and core stakeholders.

---++ Pointers to information about Bestman

We have Bestman packaged as an source RPM, and that includes both information on how it is built and the source code itself:
http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-development/source/SRPMS/bestman2-2.1.2-1.src.rpm

Bestman&#39;s codeforge page (links to downloads):
https://codeforge.lbl.gov/projects/bestman/

Information about Bestman&#39;s public source code repository. (There is also  a private repository):
https://codeforge.lbl.gov/scm/?group_id=54

---++ Agenda 

   * Introduction, Charge
   * Gather questions and agenda items issues from the assessment group.
   * Bestman Architecture
      * Provided: architecture documentation and diagrams
      * Q&amp;A
   * Bestman Code
      * Provided: Design, developer and user documentation
      * Discussion: number of files / file layout / lines of code / How much isn&#39;t in Java?
      * Team identifies resources used and kinds of thing being done: network I/O vs. Storage &quot;stuff&quot; vs. config files ...
   * OSG Bestman Build and RPM structure
      * Walk through Bestman build and RPM structure with the team
      *  jar files:
         * Where are the jar files sourced from?
         * How is versioning identified and maintained? 
         * How are and can the jar files be maintained?
         * Who are the providers of the jar files and what are the agreements for their maintenance and support?
         * Walk through one of them as an example
   * Ease of evolution of the software
      * Discuss/identify impact and effort  to switch from httpg to https, what code/libraries would need to be touched? How deeply?
      * Discuss/identify impact and effort to move to OpenJDK and Java 7
   * Security:
      * Provide a list of previously identified security flaws and their resolution.
      * Discuss What runs as root? How/when user switching is done?
   * Code maintenance:
      * Source code management
      * Discuss testing process and needs before a release.	
      * Understand the use and experience with JNI
      * Provide list of dependencies on external software?		
      * Walk through a release process
   * Known requests/changes needed
      * Provide current list of requests and changes. 
      * Estimate effort to do them? 
       * Walk through one of them--effect on code &amp; libraries. How much of Bestman do we touch?
       * What do we think &quot;multiplier cost&quot; is for someone new to the code?

   * Known use cases by OSG stakeholders
   * Work through estimates of needed effort/expertise
