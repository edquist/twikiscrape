Key Initiatives
   1. Release of standalone mesh-configuration: Soichi was approved to work 1 FTE mo over 6 months, finishing in Apr (slipped from Sep 30). Initial release to include non-WLCG sites planned for Jan. This configuration is compatible with the mesh-configuration maintained by perfSONAR.
   2. Release of perfSONAR v4.0, expected in Feb. Will need upgrade campaign for the sites that fail auto-update. Also working to publish all perfSONAR metrics to the system, rather than a selection, at a 25% increase in the data size.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Service meets SLA, but with stability problems. Examples: MadDash (to display meshes) has intermittent daily load issues; reason not understood, mitigated by restarts. ITB instances also unstable. Investigating possible conflicts of resources.
   2. Network data lifecycle management: running out of space. Written document describing problem and options. Plan to increase local storage by 24 TB, compared to a data ingest of 5 TB / yr.
   3. Recruiting 10 new non-WLCG sites for OSG networking. Delayed to Feb (from Oct), waiting for standalone meshconfig and perfSONAR v4.0. Planning reach-out campaign now.
   4. Release of alarming system into production (slipped from Dec 1). Initial alarm conditions in place; now investigating options for alerting (e.g. check_mk).

Key Accomplishments
   1. 3 papers for CHEP on Networking with OSG components.
