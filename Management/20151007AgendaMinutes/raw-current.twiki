---++ Tim Cartwright - Software

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 12 August 2015:

   * *EL&amp;nbsp;7.* Making progress on “big 4” Java packages (VOMS Admin, GUMS, !BeStMan, HDFS) and their dependencies
   * *GUMS.* Major security update (September) plus many small improvements and fixes
   * *Java.* Dealt with the loss of another Maven repository on which we relied
   * *HTCondor-CE.* Many small improvements and fixes, including better PBS Pro support
   * *StashCache.* Small improvements to shim daemon and configuration
   * *Updates.* edg-mkgridmap (for EL&amp;nbsp;7 support), GIP, !GlideinWMS, HTCondor, !XRootD
   * *ITB.* Finally got (test) user jobs running at Madison ITB site
   * *Testing.* Improved automated tests to return fewer false negatives
   * *New site support.* Clemson, Florida International, Georgia Tech

---+++ Key Initiatives

*EL&amp;nbsp;7* &amp;ndash; Still working on Java packages&amp;hellip;

*StashCache*
   * Still need to create one more RSV probe
   * Whatever else comes up (Phase II, support, etc.)

*ITB*
   * Expand site to remaining ITB hardware
   * Ramp up number of pilots to full capacity
   * Add more software components to CE and, eventually, other nodes
   * Need to discuss storage section, especially in light of !StashCache

*Documentation Renovations*
   * Purge old, unused, and obviously unnecessary documents
   * Finish prototype of new style for templates and other reusable elements
   * Complete initial version of new, user-centered Release3 home page
   * Update individual documents in priority order
   * Write mid-level overview of the !GlideinWMS system and how basic use cases work

---+++ Concerns

Not too much, things seem to be going pretty well right now!

*Upcoming Transitions*
   * Move from Java 7 &amp;rarr; Java 8
   * Continued HTCondor&amp;nbsp;CE deployments and issues
   * !StashCache &amp;rarr; Phase&amp;nbsp;II
   * *No significant issues yet, but watching effort and expectations closely*

*Documentation*
   * Started, some good progress
   * Limited staff who can contribute, at least in critical ways
   * BUT: Better to wait for right effort than create more rework
   * Tim&amp;nbsp;C. should have more time now (but I have written that line before&amp;hellip;)
