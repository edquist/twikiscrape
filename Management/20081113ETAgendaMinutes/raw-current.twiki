Present: Frank, Torre, Chander, Ruth

Agenda:

Security Policies - How we plan to work them; First one - 10 minutes - Jim Basney.

Status of Review preparations.
Ownership and credit for reliance of Panda on Condor and Condor-G. OSG is instrumental for the dependence on Condor and getting the attention and priority within the team. Torre will develop a panda slide for the review. Want to more clearly attribute what we have done for the big three. Instead of Jim Shank and Lothar presentation might be more useful to have a smaller, more specifics on what OSG has done for ATLAS and CMS presentations from Torre and Frank, a few slides. Valuable to have a good discussion block. Would avoid overlap between ATLAS and CMS presentations that happened last time. together? some common and then separate slides; impression that are in sync and agreement. 

Round table report of activities/issues
