Key Initiatives
   1. Effective service delivery for XSEDE - proceeding well
   2. Enabling more researchers to access DHTC through OSG - proceeding ok
   3. Transitioning users of Engage VO to OSG-XD or OSG-Connect (individual researchers) - Planning for 1 month transition - processing well
   4. MC simulations on OSG with LBNE - just started - many stakeholders want to influence the technical plan.
   5. Develop a plan for 2014 to increase sites and cycles for the OSG VO by 50% - new initiative
   6. Improving Gratia reporting for OSG VO per submit host.
   7. Supporting the FIFE project at Fermilab to understand how to leverage OSG initiatives

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Not many new researchers joined OSG recently - cultivating new channels
   2. Lack of tools to understand production in glideinWMS. Increase in opportunistic access may be hindered by this,
   3. Need to develop site support, as we understand the separation of gFactory operations and site support functions.
   4. Current workload is impacted by not having the 0.5 FTE at UNL on User Support

Key Accomplishments
   1. Cumulative opportunistic usage at 88M CPU hours over the past year - growing in average 1M hour per week. Recently achieved &gt;18k cores, breaking the historical barrier of 12k.
   2. Fine-tuned configuration of OSG-XD FE with the support of the glideinWMS project
   3. Continued to operate OSG public storage service for the OSG VO. Planning to move the service to GOC.
