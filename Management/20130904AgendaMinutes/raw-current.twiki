---++ Software - Tim Cartwright

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 29 May 2013 — last presentation was focused on Year 2 plans.

   * Contributed to four releases: [[Documentation.Release3.Release3119][3.1.19]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3120][3.1.20]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3121][3.1.21]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3122][3.1.22]]
      * CA certificate updates
      * CVMFS 2.0.19 &amp;ndash; 2.1.14
      * GlideinWMS 2.7.1
      * HDFS 2.0
      * HTCondor 7.9.6 &amp;ndash; 8.0.0
      * HTCondor-CE support nearly complete (in testing)
      * Java 7 packages in Upcoming production, just moved to 3.1 testing
      * SHA-2 updates complete
      * SLURM supported as a resource management system
      * VO package updates
      * Myriad bug fixes and small improvements!

   * Most sites have deployed OSG 3.1

   * Started work on “OSG Next” &amp;mdash; support for future release series (e.g., 3.2, 3.3, 4.0, &amp;hellip;)

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * WBS 1.x: Ongoing

   * [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][WBS 2.1: Transition from Oracle Java 6 to !OpenJDK 7]]
      * Going very well, expect to be complete with next release (Tuesday!)

   * WBS 2.2: Add support for SLURM resource management system
      * Essentially done, except for Gratia configuration support (coming Tuesday, I think)

   * [[SoftwareTeam.SP021_NewVersions][WBS 2.3: Prepare for OSG 3.2 and beyond (aka “OSG Next”)]]
      * In progress now
      * Coding, testing, deployments, etc., scheduled now through 22 October
      * Aiming for a 3.2.0 release on 12 November

   * WBS 2.4: Merge in latest Globus Toolkit changes, including upstreamed patches
   * WBS 4.1: Move Globus patches upstream
      * Waiting for Globus Toolkit 5.2.5 release (imminent)
      * Then will update patches and contribute to Globus
      * Globus Toolkit 5.2.6 may be based mostly on our patches

   * WBS 5.1: Simplify test development by improving test framework
      * Added ability to read configuration file (helps with tests-as-jobs and environment tweaking)
      * Will add dynamically generated CA, host, and user certificates (can run in more environments)
      * Will rewrite sequencing engine, express tests as DAG, and randomize topological sort (more diversity)

   * WBS 5.2: Run tests as normal jobs locally and perhaps in OSG
      * Have run osg-test as a VM universe job in CHTC, but still have a few failures
      * Need to expand set of available base OS images (to current 6)
      * Plan is to replace current tests with VM universe-based ones in next 6 months or so
      * *MANY* technical challenges and hurdles to make this all work!

   * WBS 6.1: 2013 OSG User School
      * Submitted one part of 2012 final report, waiting for Indiana on other part
      * Wrapping up finances and final assignments from 2013 School
      * Planning follow-ups, in terms of a survey or two, plus mentoring duties
      * Starting to think about using (the dreaded?) social media to help promote and communicate

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Past:* Defining Technology, Software, and Release Teams
      * Seems to be going well
      * Still working on hiring and staff duties at some institutions

   * *Past:* Multiple Important Projects
      * Seem to be juggling many projects at once fairly well
      * Number of simultaneous, high-priority projects going down (phew!)

   * *Past:* Slowed or Delayed Projects
      * Many projects carried over to Year 2, on track to reach most/all of them

   * *Tracking Upstream Changes*
      * Example: Still had condor-7.8.6 long after 7.8.8 had been released
      * We package so many upstream components, that it is very difficult to track changes to all of them
      * Nominally assigned to the Release team now, but it is a big task
      * Need to work with !BrianB and !TimT to come up with a real plan here


---+++  Tim Theisen - Release
---+++ Recent Accomplishments

   * *Releases*
      * Since last Software report
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3119][3.1.19]]: gratia-probe fix; CVMFS 2.0.19; GlideinWMS 2.7.1; client tarball fixes; HTCondor 7.9.6 in upcoming 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3120][3.1.20]]: Update CA certificates 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3121][3.1.21]]: Update CA certificates and VO data; Upcoming: OpenJDK 7, HDFS 2, HTCondor 8.0.0 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3122][3.1.22]]: CVMFS 2.1.14, VO package v46, RSV/osg-configure improvement/bug fixes, SLURM, dCache-SRMClient; Upcoming: OpenJDK7

   * Established predictable release schedule
      * Aligns with GOC schedule
      * Unexpected Benefit: Software Team has specific time to work on futures
      * Aiming for about one per month, but will do interim releases (e.g., 3.1.20) as appropriate

   * Record of testing performed in the JIRA ticket

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * ITB instance in Madison
      * Be better able to test the system as a whole
      * Much closer to the user experience

   * Collect Standard Test Cases
      * Repeatability of Testing
      * Able to hand components to new testers

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Difficult to Get Early Adopters*
      * Multiple Solicitations needed
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs
      * Perhaps, some (not all) people that scream for something are not willing to test?

   * *Finding appropriate testers*
      * Have had luck working the personal network to find helpful individuals
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs

   * Still Learning

---+++ Minutes

Key Initiatives for Software
   1. Preparing environment for new software release (v3.2.0), maintaining in parallel old one (v3.1). Automating these transitions where possible. New release will include HDFS2, HTCondor 8.0, HTCondor CE, and new Globus updates.
   2. Transferring Globus patches used in OSG to Globus: targeting 1/3 of them for this round.
   3. Improving test framework to simplify development of tests and to increase flexibility by moving towards dynamically allocated VM for testing.

Top Issues / Concerns for Software
    1. Tracking changes to products. No big concerns: most concerns of the past are getting resolved.

Key Accomplishments for Software
   1. 4 releases including HTCondor-CE, SLURM, Java 7, SHA2
   2. OSG v3.1 deployed at most sites - about a dozen remaining at v2.


Key Initiatives for Release
   1. Setting up ITB instance in UWisc to have redundant testbed.
   2. Collecting test cases to enable repeatability

Top Issues / Concerns for Release
   1. Hard to find early adopters to match release schedule. Defined release schedule will help find adopters.
   2. Finding testers is not easy for all products. ITB instance will enable the team to test products internally.
   3. Tim T still ramping up.

Key Accomplishments for Release
   1. Defining release schedule
   2. Organized process to record test cases for each component
