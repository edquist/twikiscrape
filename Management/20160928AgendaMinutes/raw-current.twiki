---++ Operations - Scott Teige

---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1. Front Line Support and Operational Services meet SLA definitions. 
      * [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]]
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PerfSONARDataStoreRCA][RCA]] for perfsonar outage
         * log access is complete
         * Improved monitoring in progress
   2. Marina Krenz has joined OSG Operations as a developer.
      * The 20% of Soichi&#39;s effort devoted to training Marina has ended
      * Marina now has primary responsibility for ticket and ticket exchange, secondary for OIM
      * Ticket exchange with XSEDE well along, to be fully operational next release cycle.
      * contacts in place for XSEDE
   3. HTCondor Transition Plan
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/CondorCETransitionPlan][Plan]] 
      * GRAM Support Ending Message went out April 14 - November is the date for support end. 
      * Operations part is complete
   4. GRNOC that provides service desk staffing and tools are negotiating a contract with Service Now
      * Many possible affects for ticketing exchange and presentation
      * This is still several months away, but will take planning and coordination with our collaborators
         * EGI, WLCG, FNAL, BNL
      * I expect a very slow burn to full implementation
   5. Final move of legacy contents from software.grid.iu.edu
      * This is close just needs a final push to complete
      * Standing by to complete the shutdown
   6. Gratia sustainable for life of the current grant
      * Frank is calling for more immediate action. Prototype based on !ElasticSearch in September, turn down of Gratia by year end. 
      * UNL is providing the testbed cloud resources. More decisions will be made as the project matures. 
      * [[https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/gracc-payload-summary][GRACC.opensciencegrid.org]] is available
      * gratia-apel reporting interface needs to be written
   7. Cancer Computer - Non-profit cluster looking to do cancer research jobs from OSG. 
      * Cancer Computer running jobs: &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/CancerComputerSlots.png&quot; alt=&quot;CancerComputerSlots.png&quot; width=&#39;512&#39; height=&#39;309&#39; /&gt;    
   8. !PerfSONAR and GRACC CHEP submissions
   9. Long term projects and directions
      * Reduce the hardware owned and administered by OSG Operations
         * Depend on OSG organizational institutions cloud type services
         * Never get to 100%, but should get as close as possible
         * We&#39;ve been moving backwards with new !perfSONAR and new VM hosts added
      * Update service environment to a more standard configuration management system
         * Ansible based configuration management is in place
         * Oasis and Stash development teams have access to the machine that implements the new system
            * External collaborators, relatively easy to add others as appropriate
         * 26/July and subsequent releases were ansible based 
         * Effort will need to be shifted, possibly from Operations Support, to get this done in a proper manner. 
         * Service machines switched: condor collector, oasis, oasis-login, oasis-replica, oim, stash redirector, tx, web
         * Internal machines switched: csiu, kvmhost, lvs, staff, wn
            * csiu has Lustre a capable kernel, xrootd origin server capability and has oasis mounted
      * Cleaning up expired/out dated documents from the TWiki
         * Have gathered metrics on TWiki usage to determine what are the most visited pages
         * Determine a proper archiving method, we want to remove documents from public but keep a record for revisiting if necessary


---+++ Concerns and Issues

   1. Staffing changes
      * Integrating new staff at beginning of June to alleviate pressures on other staff. 
   2. IPv6
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Sandbox/OperationsServicesIPv6CompatibilityTable][TWiki Page]]
      * Not much activity for Ops
      * Effort is ramping up
   3. BDII Deprecation
      * End of life [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2016/07/planned-retirement-of-osg-bdii.html][announcement]] sent 15/July
      * Activity has leveled off after initial WLCG discussions. 
         * Current plan is to provide WLCG with information in JSON format from OIM data (existing with possible minor extensions). 
         * My mail to the WLCG-IS working group chair and OSG and GLUE2.0 - &quot;As I’ve repeated several times over several years, OSG has no plans to implement GLUE 2.0 in general. Outside of these specifically defined uses for WLCG, we will not being putting any effort into providing information in a GLUE2 schema.&quot;
      * The current version has a hard deadline of March 2017 due to the RHEL 5 life cycle ending.

---+++ Goals and Metrics Update (Year4)
   1. Many of these are behind due to staffing discussed above.
   2. Goal #5 - &quot;Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort.&quot; - Additional hardware in place for production services providing a home for this work. I don&#39;t see having the effort for this until the next round of funding. 
   3. Goal #6 - &quot;Continue to provide training on new technologies to equip support desk staff to troubleshoot issue as they are reported.&quot; - Working with UCSD !GlideIn Ops to provide access to logs and common problems documentation so Ops support can do more in depth and proactive troubleshooting of !GlideInWMS problems. Kyle and Rob G are talking about offloading user support tasks to the ops support desk. 
   4. Goal #7 - &quot;Develop and share a set of metrics that provide a reasonable measure of responsiveness to stakeholder tickets.&quot; - See draft document at - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/QATicket

---++ Stakeholder Request Management - Gabriele Garzoglio

https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10030

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Gratia is sustainable for life of the current grant. OSG Display and gratia-apel reporting interface are the remaining items for GRACC - a month behind. Then need 2 months of stable ops before turning off Gratia.
   2. Ansible-based configuration management is in place and used; expect to spend effort to transition remaining service deployments to use it.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Ramping up Marina Krenz within OSG Operations as a developer
   2. IPv6: not much activity but ramping up.
   3. BDII Deprecation: minimal usage at this point; expected turn off on Mar 2017

Key Accomplishments
   1. Cancer Computer (non-profit cluster for cancer research) running jobs from OSG.
   2. HTCondor Transition Plan complete for operational part.
   3. Final move of legacy contents from software.grid.iu.edu
