---+++ Software - Tim Cartwright
---+++ Key Initiatives

   * [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][Java Migration]]
      * Moving from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7
      * Last (expected) security updates to JDK 6 just shipped (yesterday)
      * Initial builds are mostly complete (except HDFS 2.0)
      * Initial testing underway (mostly good news)
         * !BeStMan 2: needs minor configuration change, otherwise basic functionality is good
         * !dCache SRM client: basic functionality is good
         * GUMS: finding some issues on EL5 (appear easy to fix), basic functionality is good on EL6
         * VOMS Admin: minor install warnings, basic functionality is good
      * May have some or all major components ready for external testing by end of March %RED%???%ENDCOLOR%

   * [[SoftwareTeam.NonRootClients][Tarball clients]] (&amp;ldquo;install anywhere by anyone&amp;rdquo;, aka _non-root_)
      * Support non-root and relocatable clients that match RPMs
      * Needed before actual EOL of OSG 1.2
      * Progress is good: Script creates tarball(s) (on EL5), just starting testing
      * *Note:* Will include some OS and EPEL software, but we do not plan to update those parts more often than normal releases

   * *Support for SLURM* (another batch system)
      * Coming along well, in scalability testing right now
      * May ship initial release in 3.1.16 (standard repo or Upcoming, depending)

   * *HTCondor-CE*
      * Effort concerns had this off of the near-term list, but now back on
      * Just getting started on the packaging parts of this project (HTCondor team has done a lot!)

   * *Ongoing Updates and Support*
      * Software: CA certificates, Fetch CRL v3 on el5, !GridFTP, HDFS (0.20), VOMS (2.0.x), &amp;hellip;
      * Sites: Oklahoma (LSF), RENCI-Blueridge, &amp;hellip;
      * Tickets (GOC and JIRA)

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Multiple High-Priority Projects*
      * Java, client, upcoming, !HTCondor-CE, SLURM, SHA-2
      * Added effort will help, but see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month The Mythical Man-Month]]
      * Working closely with Technology, Production, and Project Management areas
      * Outlook: Cautiously optimistic!

   * %GRAY%effort%ENDCOLOR%
      * Lost 0.5 FTE (Doug Strain)
      * Added 2.0 FTE (Carl Edquist, Brian Lin)
      * Contributing 1.0 FTE for 3 months to HTCondor
      * Tim must run 2013 OSG User School, getting some help locally (PAs, Lauren Michael)

   * *Slowed or Delayed Projects*
      * Documentation: Affects end-user experience &amp;mdash; chipping away at most important tasks
      * Testing: Affects end-user experience &amp;mdash; making small progress, esp. on infrastructure
      * Configuration management: Affects end-user experience &amp;mdash; not started
      * Debian support: Affects who can use OSG Software &amp;mdash; not started
      * Community packaging, especially w.r.t. EPEL: Affects effort &amp;mdash; not started (but, e.g., Java)

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

   * *Releases*
      * Since last Software report (30 January 2013):
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3115][3.1.15]]: Fetch CRL v3 on EL5, Upcoming repo, !GridFTP, !gLExec, etc.
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3114][3.1.14]]: CA certs, frontier-squid, HDFS 0.20, OASIS config
      * Aiming for about one per month, but will do interim releases (e.g., 3.1.14) as appropriate

   * *&gt; 65% Deployment of OSG Software 3 (RPMs)*
      * As of 5 March 2013: 66 sites using OSG 3, 37 sites using OSG 1.2
      * OSG 1.2 deprecation notice sent to sites, more coming soon

---+++ Stakeholder Request Management - Gabriele Garzoglio

http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10030

Tim will address requests 28, 44, 48, 49 - Seeking input from ET on request 33

---+++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Schedule-driven Big projects - Java, SHA-2, Tarball clients - continue to proceed well and on schedule.
   2. Internally-driven Big projects - SLURM, HTCondor-CE - Proceeding as before with minor delays due to effort limitations
   3. Ongoing maintenance and support - continuous work proceeds as expected

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Multiple high-priority projects - careful management of priorities to handle the complexity in the dependencies and timelines
   2. Effort - improved. Additions: 2 new people: quick ramp up on detailed work; slow ramp up on &quot;the big picture&quot;. Losses: 0.5 FTE; 3 FTE mo contribution to HTCondor; Tim&#39;s effort on the OSG User School
   3. Some projects slowed / delayed - tracking dependencies and user expectations - no known adverse effects

Key Accomplishments
   1. 2 releases this months (expect about 1 per month)
   2. &gt; 65% deployment of OSG Software 3 - rate of deployment has slowed down; expect rate to pick up again.

Input from ET
   1. Propose to drop Atlas request for CREAM support - Communication on the issue as slowed down. Seeking concurrence from ET - http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/REQUESTS-33
