   * Document status managed by Owners, Reviewers, Testers using a few variables at the beginning of the documents
   * Tracking via a table on each person&#39;s home page in the TWiki ([[https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/RobertEngel][Example Tables]])
   * TWiki wide status maintained in similar table that includes all official documents
3. Create Documentation TWiki 
   * Don&#39;t plan to create a new TWiki
   * Created test !TWiki where we test plugins, tools, etc. before moving them to the production TWiki
   * Will keep track of status of documents to be improved using method above
4. Identify owners for each documentation area
   * Proposed areas (preliminary)
      * CE - Suchandra Thapa
      * SE - Tanya Levshina
      * VO - Abhishek Rana
      * Security - Mine Altunay
      * T3 - Marco Mambelli
      * User Documentation - John !McGee
5. Develop standards and templates for documents

   * Will use Comment Box appended at the end of every document
8. Deploy technology for Document Rating and Collection of Ratings
   * Problem - the identified Peer plugin is unmaintained and non functional in our TWiki release
   * Investigating difficulty of writing our own plugin (Perl).  Looking at approach used by Peer plugin.
9. Better organize documentation for each major role in OSG
   * Roles: !EndUser, !SysAdmin, !VOMgr - just started
10. Implement an effective search for Documentation
   * Requires reorganization of TWiki
   * May do some reorganization; but since most people just use Google, we need to study how to best accomplish this
   * The Storage Area is being reorganized based on a review of all storage documents
11. Get all documentation into Documentation TWiki
   * Will be changed to getting documents in new structure within current Twiki and getting them updated to new standards

---++ Plans/Issues
   1 Next big task is to do a review of all documents in a triage sort of process.  We did this for Storage.
   1 Planning a meeting of the owners of each documentation area in February for training and improving some documents
   1 Planning a broader training session at All Hands meeting in March (for everyone involved with documentation)
   1 Document Rating is an important goal from the Documentation Workshop but the implementation is an issue
   1 Getting good Google searches to be researched
