Key Initiatives
   1. Allocation-based HPC: LIGO most active to date (Stampede); CMS and MINOS have also allocations now. Now working on solidifying the systems (Stampede and SDSC).
   2. Opportunistic use by LHC: ATLAS and CMS have demonstrated capability at small scale. May ramp up for peak provisioning later in the year.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Need to improve on linking OSG and XSEDE ticketing systems to support the HPC initiative
   2. Observe lowering usage of resources by the Fermilab experiments. Will address this at the FIFE workshop at the end of June.

Key Accomplishments
   1. 67M h opportunistic in the past quarter. We can observe the effects of LIGO and AMS winding down.
