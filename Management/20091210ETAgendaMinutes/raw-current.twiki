---++ Agenda

   * 1.8 [[20101210TrainingContentManagementReport][Training and Content Management]] – Jim Weichel  _(confirmed)_
 
   * 2.1 Scalability, Reliability and Usability  – Igor Sfiligoi _(confirmed)_
      * storage testing&lt;br&gt;Bestman+HDFS was extensively tested at UCSD. The results were presented as a paper at IEEE conference and are available as [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=911][OSG DOC 911]].&lt;br&gt;Performed a benchmark using different levels of security options; CPUs seem fast enough these days that we could afford both integrity and privacy; see [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/GSIFTPTest][the test page]].&lt;br&gt;Now collaborating with CMS to get IO profiling of several OSG sites.
      * GRAM5 testing&lt;br&gt;Deployed GRAM5 at UCSD on top of standard OSG CE.&lt;br&gt;Benchmark numbers very impressive; 10x speedup compared to GT2. Load on the CE also much lower; the new operational logic should also prevent overloads due to too many jobs being submitted. See [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/GRAM5Test1][GRAM5 test page]] and [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/OSGCESubmitterTestingAndMonitoring][GT2 test page]].&lt;br&gt;Still some bugs that lead to GRAM5 lockouts. Working with both Globus team and Condor team to iron out the observed problems.&lt;br&gt;A possible problem without a current solution is the fact that PRIMA does not work with GRAM5 and there are no plans in the Privilege group to solve this before next summer.
      * CREAM testing&lt;br&gt;Testing of a European instance worked fine, but low scale.&lt;br&gt;Have tried to install a CREAM insteance at UCSD, but found problems; CREAM developers helping with those right now.
      * glideinWMS work&lt;br&gt;Assisting CMS in their request for having a single listening port node in the glideinWMS installation. Discussion with the Condor team and testing of the per-releases.
      * testing frameworks&lt;br&gt;Finished the testing and monitoring CE framework; repository at [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/osgscal/][http://sourceforge.net/projects/osgscal/]]. In the process of finalising the packaging.&lt;br&gt;Work started on a framework for distributed testing; the aim is to have a tool that uses O(1000) Grid slots to run controlled tests against centralized services (like SRM). Will be based on a flavor of glideinWMS. 

   * 2.2 Work Load Management – Maxim Potekhin _(confirmed)_: report - [[%ATTACHURL%/WMS_Area_Report_20091210_1.ppt][Powerpoint slides]],  [[%ATTACHURL%/WMS_Area_Report_20091210_1.pdf][PDF]]


   * 2.4 [[Internet2Update10dec09][Internet2 Network Monitoring Update]] – Jeff Boote _(confirmed)_
