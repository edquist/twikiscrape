---++ Campus Grids - Rob Gardner

   * Previous campus grids [[20140604AgendaMinutes][report]]
   * OSG Council report last week [[http://1.usa.gov/1nChAIl][here]]
   * Updates:
      * Distributed Environment Modules deployed (includes statistics gathering on usage)
      * Meeting with Piotr Sliz to discuss sharing biomedical applications (software and infrastructure)
      * New OSG Connect menus and personalized monitoring on login.   (work in progress)
      * Continuous validation in production: http://build.ci-connect.net:8080/ 
      * New hire at UC delayed till 8/15 (!H1B issues)
      * Adding new OSG Connect endpoints
         * Syracuse: Large opportunistic Condor cluster 8000 cores at night in VMs, 4k in the day, mostly Ubuntu and RH, working through issues (firewall, IP connectivity, shared file system, Condor pools).  Lincoln Bryant at UC working on initial setups.
         * St. Louis University: SGE cluster of 75 machines  (there were local networking issues). 
      * Connect work continues
         * UMich Connect (login, portal complete; compute nodes cannot communicate outside campus) 
         * UChicago CI Connect (login portal complete; working on modules based Bosco client for native submission from Midway cluster)
         * ATLAS Connect (added UC Midway cluster using OASIS, CVMFS via NFS export. Biggest issue is CVMFS at TACC)
         * CMS Connect - planning with Kevin Lannon (Notre Dame). Will imply new development for institutional sharing agreements (a la &quot;me, my friends, the grid&quot;) [[%ATTACHURL%/CMS_Connect_Planning_-_Google_Slides.pdf][(slides)]]. Will discuss using USCMS VO front-end, and LPC CAF as initial resource targets.
