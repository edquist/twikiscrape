 OSG Newsletter, March 2012 
Vignettes from the 2012 OSG All Hands Meeting
By all accounts – and I am getting many of them - last week’s All- Hands Meeting (AHM) was a great success.
<p />
This year saw an increase in the number of joint technical sessions between VOs covering areas of common interest; these included sessions on data federation, site technologies, campus and cloud technologies, and a review of WLCG working group summaries for databases, operations, workload management. 
<p />
There was a definite “buzz” about continuing to engage campus scientists, understanding their needs and helping them achieve their science. The keynotes from Brian Pytlik-Zillig, (humanities), Tessa Durham, (biology), and Florian Richter,(enzyme design with Rosetta on OSG) were of particular note. 
<p />
Tessa Durham’s talk focused on how to solve the problem of how genomes function at the organismal scale; she walked the audience through the scientific problem, and clearly illustrated the time and resource savings experienced by being able to take advantage of the OSG to conduct data analysis. 
<p />
Alain Roy also gave a talk that provided an overview of the various software upgrades occurring this year, including: a major Globus upgrade, OSG 3.0 release, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, VOMs and Condor upgrades. 
<p />
Buzz worthy quotes from Dan Fraser: “Scaling the infrastructure to meet new challenges…providing opportunities for advancing science via new users….. OSG has feet on the ground at over 100 campuses and labs.” Everyone is encouraged to read Frank Wuerthwein’s talk on Science on the OSG, which garnered a lot of discussion. The group learned that protein structure has become a major science theme on the OSG, with both experimental and theoretical work being pursued. 
<p />
Among the surprising science topics were an economics study on horse racing, including betting tips, and the research conducted on the climatology of Barrow, Alaska. Kimberly Myles said: “These examples made clear the incredible diversity of the science that is being conducted using OSG resources.” 
<p />
The OSG 2017 lightening talks were interesting: Rob Quick foresaw an increased necessity for interoperability. With services for international VOs and community building continuing full force. Alain Roy predicted that the total number of software components unique to OSG would go down dramatically and would be packaged for larger community use although he maintained the OSG would always have some of “our own” packaging. 
<p />
The poster session on Tuesday was another great success with active groups gathered round the presenters at all times. 
<p />
On an international note, John Sanabria, of the Universidad del Valle discussed Grid Colombia, outlining their infrastructure. The key message was that Grid Colombia’s focus on supporting Colombia’s scientific development continues to progress. He highlighted the attendance of OSG representatives at a recent workshop and the value of Grid Columbia’s relationship with OSG. 
<p />
Derek’s Live USBs were a great success. His blog post about the AHM, located at, is well worth a read.
<p />
Many thanks are due from us all to David Swanson, Ken Bloom, Brian Bockelman, Larita Lang and their team for another great venue, organization and social calendar. 
<p />
Ken Bloom, deputy head and new OSG Council member for US CMS S&amp;C said: “It was very encouraging to see all the interaction taking place between people from the various VO's, and the great interest that everyone had in helping campus colleagues 'submit locally and compute globally,' as Frank had put it. We believe that after eating and drinking locally (in Lincoln), our OSG collaborators will be all the more energized to take over the globe!" 
<p />
David Swanson, the workshop host, commented that there “were indeed very happy to host, and hope all who attended found it true that there is no place like Nebraska." 
<p />
By all accounts participants would completely agree with that final phrase!

From the outgoing OSG Executive Director
The term of the OSG Executive Director is a two-year appointment followed by an election. My current term comes to an end in 2012. As I indicated in fall of 2011, I did not elect to stand for another term. 
<p />
We are extremely fortunate that Lothar Bauerdick, who has been serving as Associate Executive Director since May 2011, has accepted the nomination and has now been elected by the Council as the new Executive Director of the Open Science Grid. Lothar presented his “State of the OSG” address at the All Hands meeting last week (url). 
<p />
Lothar will start his term on Monday, April 2nd. There will be a 2two -month transition period during which Lothar and I will work together to ensure a smooth transition of the responsibilities. 
<p />
I am very excited to hand over the reigns of the OSG project to such a talented and experienced individual. I look forward to working with him and the rest of the OSG family as we move forward. I plan and hope to be a continuing part of the OSG collaboration in other capacities over the next few years. 
<p />
I want to especially thank the current Executive Team, Area Coordinators, the OSG staff, the Council and the many members of the OSG Consortium for your support, contributions, and collaboration over the past six years of OSG and more than ten years of grid projects in the US. 
<p />
This month also sees a transition for Britta Duadert, who is leaving the OSG at Caltech. For many years she has been the LIGO application integrator on the project. She has recently been making good progress running the Binary Inspiral application across several OSG sites. I want to sincerely thank Britta for all her contributions and wish her the very best for the future.
