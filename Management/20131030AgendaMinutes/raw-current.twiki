Key Initiatives
   1. Traceability for users without certificates: OSG jobs directly submitted to the OSG-XSEDE node run on Fermilab now. Propose to extend the trust model to GLOW.
   2. CILogon basic CA from known IdP: adoption extended to 6 sites.
   3. OSG Connect: investigating whether OIM authentication can be used to access OSG Connect.
   4. Identity Management Roadmap: revisiting roadmap from last year. Focusing on DigiCert contract renewal.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Need to onboard additional users / VOs to take advantage of CILogon.
   2. Java 6 potential vulnerabilities: java 6 is still widespread in OSG. Working with sites to upgrade to java 7.
   3. We may need to grant an extension to the SHA-2 transition deadline: CMS and CERN CA are not ready.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Traceability for users without certificates
   2. Security Controls and Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment is completed
