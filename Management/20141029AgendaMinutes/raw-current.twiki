---++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. perfSONAR 3.4.1 released yesterday. Autoupdate is on by default: learning from Shellshock vulnerability, which cause perfSONAR downtimes.
   2. Progress on OSG production infrastructure at GOC: MaDDash (metrics), OMD (service monitoring), and Datastore deployed. As sites deploy perfSONAR 3.4.1, production data will be populated.
   3. Documentation updates and outreach activities.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Still need to obtain OSG monitoring subnet on LHCONE to include sites there.
   2. Need to validate: (a) production integration of perfSONAR 3.4 instances on OSG and Datastore; (b) OSG mesh-configuraiton creation capabilities; (c) metrics and service monitoring (MaDDash)
   3. Need to define APIs to access data

Key Accomplishments
   1. Mesh-creation ready for production testing and deployment.

On the horizon
   1. WLCG perfSONAR deployment campaign. Targeting Dec 1 for sites to upgrade.
   2. Evolving OSG network service, gaining experience as data is available
