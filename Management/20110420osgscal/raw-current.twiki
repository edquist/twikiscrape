---+  2.1 	Scalability, Reliability and Usability 	- Report as of Apr 20th 2011

by Igor Sfiligoi

No major roadblocks, things are proceeding smoothly. The only area that is possibly behind is testing of central services (GRATIA and BDII); no real good reason for that... just stating a fact.

More details below.

---++ 2.1.1 	Test scalability and reliability of storage 	
---+++ 2.1.1.1 Quarterly status report about SRM (all combinations) scalability 	
   * dCache - Results available (as usual) at [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/DCTest][http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/DCTest]]
   * HDFS+Bestman - No New releases.
   * xrootd+Bestman - Waiting to get access to a server. No progress yet.
---+++ 2.1.1.2 Evaluate new Bestman releases 	
No new releases.

---+++ 2.1.1.3 Follow and evaluate xrootd usage without an SRM 	
Testing started using the Nebraska xrootd.
