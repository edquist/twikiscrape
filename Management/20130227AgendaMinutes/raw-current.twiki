Key Initiatives
   1. Scale tests of HTCondor-CE proceeding with about a 2 weeks delay. This is due to resources still shifted to OSG Software, while the new staff ramps up. 
   2. Working on the initial round of feedback on the glideinWMS monitoring to improve system usability.
   3. Completed design document of the Grid Exerciser. These VO-oriented tests will help bootstrap site functionalities, such as HTPC, idle CPU monitoring, etc.
   4. Beta release of OASIS is 1-2 weeks behind schedule (post-AHM now). Production release still on track to be in early Apr.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Effort - with Ashu Guru leaving, the effort on GratiaWeb maintenance will be below nominal for a few months.
   2. Cross-CE - slow progress due to lack of effort on the gLExec plugin.

Key Accomplishments
   1. OASIS almost fully transitioned to Operations.
