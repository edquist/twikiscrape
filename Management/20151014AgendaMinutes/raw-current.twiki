---++ Security - Mine Altunay
---+++Key Work Items
   * OSG CA 
      * Very good news. We are hitting all our deadlines in fact we are 2 months ahead of our original schedule.
      * I attended IGTF face-face meeting remotely on Sept 30th. Before the meeting, I worked with our reviwers to make sure they are ready to submit their reports to IGTF. At the meeting, I gave a talk on our CA and ask for a voting. We passed the written review (CP/CPS review) with some contingencies, which allowed us to start the operational review, which is separate from the CP/CPS review. 
      * A few weeks after F2F meeting, we passed our operational reviews and worked with reviewers to satisfy their contingencies on our written review.
      * Finally last week, our IGTF Accreditation was fully approved.  OSG CA is accepted into the IGTF CA bundle. We also made the October deadline to get into IGTF October 26th distribution. We already turned in all our files, and IGTF is already processing our CA files at the earliest,  to release us in their October 26th release. 
      * OSG Software team kindly agreed to release the IGTF bundle around Nov 3 or 4th so our CMS and Atlas sites can install it. 
      * We originally thought we could start our transition in January 2016 at the earliest. But later when we got hopeful about gaining our accreditation earlier, we agreed to start the transition in November.  A few months ago, I asked CMS and Atlas whether they would be willing to start it in November, which they both agreed. G
      * We are starting the testing/transitioning phase this November with CMS and Atlas. Both VOs will use OSG CA only for host certs, they will get user certs form CERN CA.  GOC is in the process of changing the expiration notices sent to Atlas users directing them to CERN CA. 
      * Like our testing phase, Neha Sharma will be the lead and Jeny will work with her. CMS and Atlas already compiled a list of services that they want to test. We expect to finish their transition before the holidays
      * We will continue transition form january through june. Fermilab will be transitioned in february. We expect the process go very smoothly afterwards as all the big VOs have already gone through the process. 

   * HEPCloud security assessment
      * Diving into the Amazon authN/authZ model and how it ties into our X.509 management. I was planning on doing the risk assessment in January after the HEPCloud architecture is finalized but some recent developments changed our plans. I will start it in November and continue until the architecture finalized. 
      * plan to give a training session to project staff and admins who will operate the infrastructure later. 
   
   * OSG Connect security drill
      * The drill is almost completed along with a full security assessment of OSG Connect. I will report on this at our next meeting as I do not have the final report from Anand yet. 

   * IF AuthN Model changes. 
      * Project is moving along nicely. Fermilab finally has an IdP that fully works with CIlogon Basic CA. It can provide certificates on the browser and on the command line. Fermilab had to  build a new Shibboleth IdP to provide the command line support. This was a complicated process since Fermilab&#39;s current IdP only worked in browser. We needed a new Shib-IdP and we had to create a new set of requirements and negotiate a set of attribute values for the command line interface to work. 
      * Next steps are getting the proposed architecture reviewed by a panel of experts; start the necessary software changes in Fermi-provided services and software.  


   * Research
      * CISR Research paper is due to be submitted on october 31st. We are explaning how we connect IF experiments to InCommon federated identities. We completed our 7th draft and already got feedback from several reviewers. We will send it out around for one more round of reviews. 

   * Operational Security
      * Vulnerabilities and Incidents
         * Dcache vulnerability -- high level. Sent announcement to OSG sites to apply the patch. 
         * USDC security incident. A cluster in China got root compromised. Attacker installed a ssh keylogger and cpu miner to bitcoin. We reported to incident to OSG community and asked to check connections from the comrpomsied IP address. AGLT2 noticed that a user ssh account was compromised. We received another report from U of Michigan about suspicious user activities. None of the activities were successful. It is understood that another user&#39;s ssh account got hacked. All the users that also have accounts at China got rekeyed and given new passwords. No impact on grid resources. 
         * UCR-HEP reported another possible ssh compromise. But after investigating, we found this to be not true.  
      * Operations 
         * Finally Jeny is on the grid-sec mailing list and our communications with EGI/WLCG and otehr partners grids back on track. Frank also hada  good discussion with Romain while at CERN. Frank was planning to brief ET about this conversation. Basically, WLCG/EGI has a different operational security scope than us. They are much more involved in non-grid security- security of systems that are not used for grid computing. They participate in several bodies that investigate all kinds of incident vulnerabilities that has no direct impact on grid systems but impact the OS, networks, etc. We always kept OSG scope to grid-only. We specifically asked our sites to contact site security first and get our help on grid related incident later. Romain is disappointed that we are not participating as much as they do, but with our current effort profile venturing beyond the grid is very difficult. If the ET agrees we should increase our scope, we should re-visit this.  
         * Distributing CRLs files via CVMFS. we contacted CERN about what security monitoring and cautions they take with distributing the CRLs. We got a reply from Romain. But the issue is their security model is sufficiently different from us that they can get away with less monitoring and 3-hour update frequency. We are writing the security requirements to be completed by the end of this week. We already asked update frequency to be increased to 6 hours. 
         * We asked software team to change the software install instructions such that it  should download the initial rpms containing the GPG signing keys using https instead of http.  The repo web server had its certificate chain fixed. Now a commercially tristed certificate is used for the initial bootstrapping.  
         * We wrote a new guidelines document on explaining certificate management and shared accounts especially for IF experiments. 
         * GUMS admin interface assessment is completed. We did not find any further vulnerabilities. We would like to send GUMS to SWAMP team for a thorough check. 
         * OSG CA bundle routine deployment request and fixed the documentation. 
   
     

---++ Stakeholder Request Management - Gabriele Garzoglio

---++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. HEP Cloud security assessment: starting risk assessment now.
   2. OSG Connect security drill: drill and security assessment done. Anand is writing the final report.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Intensity Fronteir AuthN model: deployed IdP based on CILogon Basic CA for browser and CLI credentials. Now reviewing proposed architecture. Goal to turn off KCA in 2016. No solid plans for the integration with experiments at this point. Written CISR paper on this.
   2. Ops: dCache Vulnerability is high-level: communicating with sites to apply the patch. USDC (Cluster in China) compromised: reacting and looking out for suspicious activities on OSG as spill over.
   3. Request from sites to distribute CA CRLs via CVMFS. Several implications on security, operations, etc.

Key Accomplishments
   1. OSG CA IGTF Accreditation approved 2 months ahead of schedule. CA bundle will be released on Nov 4 with the new CILogon OSG CA. Planning to start transition of CMS and Atlas sites in Nov. Fermilab in Feb. Neha Sharma will technically lead the transition.
   2. Assessed GUMS admin interface: no other vulnerabilities found.
