---++ Rob Gardner -  Campus Grids


---+++ Recent Accomplishments
   * OSG CIC Webinars (*2*) and iFORUM (*4*) meetings, http://campusgrids.org 
   * OSG Connect launched, http://osgconnect.net, partnership with Globus Online team
   * [[https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/display/CON/Home][OSG ConnectBook]] - many contributions from staff throughout the project.  Solid information base and reference for future workshops.
   * OSG Connect Storage Service (Stash) launched, http://stash.osgconnect.net.
   * OSG Campus Infrastructures Workshop at Duke University, https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=6863
      * 65 registered attendees 
      * 29 filled survey response - mix of science disciplines, roles (grad students, faculty, IT staff)
      * Two days of tutorials: many contributions from OSG staff 
      * Dozens of users signed up in real time using Duke campus credentials; thousands of (simple tutorial) jobs executed by all users.  Several application types (R, Mathematica, Octave) and job management approaches (Bosco, Swift, Pegasus) demonstrated.
      * Several Duke projects created
      * Many contributinos from OSG User Support, BOSCO, Gratia, Sites, Operations, Management, RENCI teams ..  *many thanks*
      * Also Duke University that generously supported the workshop both financially and intellectually
   * Getting a number of new projects going in OSG Connect:
      * Project Name: Path Space Hybrid Monte-Carlo (PSHMC)
         * Principal Investigator: Frank Pinski, University of Cincinnati
         * Field of Science: Computational Condensed Matter Physics
      * Project Name: Knowledge Models and Cognitive Systems (!KnowelegeSys)
         * Principal Investigator: Michael Culbertson, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
         * Department/Field of Science = Educational Psychology
      * Project Name: Linkage disequilibrium&#39;s contribution to the maintenance of sexual reproduction (!EvoTheory)
         * Principal Investigator: Christina Burch, University of North Carolina
         * Field of Science: Biology
      * Project Name: National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) is a nonprofit science center dedicated to cross-disciplinary research in evolution.
         * From Duke workshop; Mats taking lead
      * Project Name: University of Chicago Research Computing Center (UChicago-RCC)
         * Principal Investigator: Birali Runesha
         * Multidisciplinary (Campus support group)


---+++ Key Initiatives
   * Continue 3-prong strategy of engagement:
      * At-large end-users
      * Departmental, groups, discipline-focused facilities (a physics department, LHC Tier 3 centers, a bioninformatics facility) 
      * The general campus research computing center
   * Campus Grids as a Service (!SaaS model), Campus Bridging Service, Campus Cycle Exchange Service - to be discussed next week&#39;s at planning meeting
   * *OSG Connect N+2*: To follow-up with Duke University research computing staff, UChicago research computing staff.  TBD: a third campus such as Indiana University or any volunteer here
   * Fixing current glitches


---+++ Top Concerns
   * Adoption of OSG Connect by &quot;the rest of OSG&quot;.  Trash/Trash/Integration with OIM, Gratia.  Identify sensible approach for support of production services by Operations, GOC.
   * Streamlining the user-facing new user/group/campus engagement workflow; integration with CRC, www.opensciencegrid.org, etc. 
   * Identifying, designing a scalable support model (national CI scale)
   * Pathway for campus contributions to OSG infrastructure (incentivizing sharing)
   * Choice, or switch of carrier VO (OSG to Engage, e.g.)
   * Integrating Stash with the OSG-wide data management strategy 
   * Supporting campus application software - managing software dependencies; ease of use of OASIS across *all* platforms (local mounts or generic campus resources). Building and supporting a libary of popular software tools.   
   * Evaluation of PALMS by OSG Technology and Software; guidance and next steps
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/palms-130918-v2.pptx][palms-130918-v2.pptx]]: palms-130918-v2.pptx
   * Evaluation of !SkeletonKey by OSG Technology and Software; guidance and next steps
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/sk-slides-09182013.pptx][sk-slides-09182013.pptx]]: sk-slides-09182013.pptx
   * Providing a common repository of reference templates for various popular workflows
   * BOSCO enhancements for Campus Grids services: 
      * Ease of queue selection
      * Ease of identity mapping between campus ID (therefore running as himself, consuming his project allocation) or as opportunistic (a common account, reaching a preemptable queue)
      1. https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/CAMPUS-133 : Propagate ProjectName form the submit file to the remote HTCondor submission
      2. https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/CAMPUS-134 : Being able to specify a Job manager (PBS/SLURM/...) queue during job submission
      3. https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-121 : Report correctly BOSCO jobs from a Condor submit host
   * Evolving OSG Connect strategy with virtualized images &amp; cloud resources
   * *Effort!*: OSG Connect officially has ~ 1 FTE support - the rest leveraged, contributed, borrowed, ...
