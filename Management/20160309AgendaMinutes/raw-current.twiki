Key Initiatives
   1. HTCondor-CE-BOSCO targeted for Apr release.  Focus on osg-configure and Gratia changes. Aims at simplifying OSG-Connect pilot infrastructure: Campus Grids would deploy locally one CE (as a VM) per cluster accessed via BOSCO (ssh)
   2. Support for LIGO (300k h/day; submit to OSG and XSEDE) and AMS (deploy BOSCO @ MIT)

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Started planning for Gratia v2. Organization needs to be better defined. Initially run two separate raw and summary ElasticSearch DB; expose the data through a message bus (to decouple from the ElasticSearch technology).
   2. CVMFS-over-StashCache delivered in &quot;integration&quot;. Need better reach out for actual utilization and transition to production. Use CVMFS for metadata delivery and StashCache for data. Repositories available for campuses (public Stash), ligo (detector data), nova (flux files), and cms (syncs from AAA).

Key Accomplishments
   1. Support for HTCondor workshop in Barcellona: well received. 70 participants from EU sites. ~5 HTCondor-CE now in EU.
