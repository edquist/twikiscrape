   * Step 2:Look under ”Information to Display” then select “Resource Service Counts”.  
   * Step 3:Next, select “Show Total Resource Count” and  last update page. 
This will give you the information for the Production and ITB Resource for the charts.  

For VO information:
   * Step 1:Return to the home page of My OSG
   * Step 2:Click “Virtual Organizations”
   * Step 3:Select Filter – Check marking on the active VO’s
   * Step 4:Update the page for the list of current VO’s

*Example:*

---++ Excel Formatted Chart
Once all of the information is gathered you will then use the statistics above and move them into an excel chart as seen below:
