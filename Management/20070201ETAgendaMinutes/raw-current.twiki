---++ Focus on OSG 0.6.0 Release
 Our main focus is the OSG 0.6.0 release.

The discussion on the CRLs will happen at Feb 2nd Trash/Trash/Blueprint meeting. Feb 1st  focus is on Storage.

Rob identified the following needs to help meet the ITB release:


&gt;  * Resolution of CEMon, and completing the publication chain through BDII

Rob and Ruth agreed that if this is not resolved a week from today (Feb 8th) that we go to a fall back position of the BDII being deployed to collect the GIP information at a site, since it is proven in production for CMS and EGEE. We understand this requires it is installed in VDT. Miron has in the past offered Non-OSG effort to do this so that the load on the VDT team is not increased. I will discuss with him the availability and time for this effort to ramp up for this time scale and bring a decision to you by the end of tomorrow.

&gt;  * Need effort help from GIP/CEMON/BDII experts to validate the accuracy
&gt;   of the information service from the client/application point of view.

Rob Quick and John Urish are talking  this afternoon; some work was done a while back by Iowa and they have effort funded by CMS to work on GIP/information. Since CMS rely on the information from the central BDII at Indiana this is then within Iowa&#39;s scope of work.  So, I propose this validation is a combination of Operations (from RobQ), CMS (Shaowen/Ransom) and FermiGrid (John).  It would be useful if Abhishek from Extensions, as the storage deployment tester, would help also with the storage information.

&gt;  * Need the VO application representatives to start testing against the 13 deployed
&gt; ITB sites and provide feedback.

Torre and Frank need to organize this -- email asap as to the plans would be very useful...

Hello OSG Executive Team,

This is a heads up to let you know that the release date of OSG 0.6.0 is likely to slip a bit from the planned date of February 15th, 2007.

The main reason that the release date slipped is that testing on the OSG Validation Testbed (VTB) took longer than expected. We believe that the testing was invaluable: there were about a dozen bug fixes and small changes that resulted from the testing, and this resulted in a release that was more stable and ready to use.  The VTB process also worked through serveral OSG configuration script issues, validated installed services with the available tools, and provided the starting set of documents for the ITB install fest.

We&#39;re still two weeks out from the release date of OSG 0.6.0, so what is left to do? Three things: updates to the VDT,  application validation, and provisioning of the final deployment documentation and production servers.

Management of the new VDT on the ITB found numerous problems, which we are turning into an update to VDT 1.6.1. We hope to have this update done by the end of the week, but then it will need additional testing to make sure that the fix isn&#39;t worse than the problem. This testing is important, and it needs time to complete.

At this point, we have begun testing on the Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed (ITB), but VOs haven&#39;t yet begun to validate their applications. We believe that this is essential before we do widespread deployment in the production grid. Testing by VOs always takes a while, due to different schedules, availability of people to do the testing, etc.

At this point, we feel confident that we can release OSG 0.6.0 by the end of February, barring any new, large problems that crop up.

A couple of extra notes:

1) The VTB was very useful, but it didn&#39;t find all of the problems. On one hand, we think we can improve the VTB&#39;s testing. But the VTB is necessarily smaller and less diverse than the ITB, and we are simply not going to find all problems.  Additionally, the VTB crew were mostly new OSG-funded hires and are still coming up to speed. The next cycle should proceed more quickly.

2) In yesterday&#39;s Facility phone call, a potentially large problem came up: how do we avoid inadvertent denial of service attacks on CA web sites when updating the CA CRLs on worker nodes? Miron believes that we need to address this before our release.

Thanks,
Alain Roy and Rob Gardner
