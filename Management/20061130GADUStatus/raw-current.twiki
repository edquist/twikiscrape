From Dinanath Sulakhe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are some sites that I didn&#39;t use due to this NFS issue. Some of them had the problem of staging a job into a job specific directory instead of the &quot;remoreintialdir&quot; specified in the condor submit file. But they are not a lot of them. Most of the sites worked for me during these runs even with larger number of CPUs. But the max cpus I got running from OSG during this run was below 600cpus. I got some 200+ cpus from teragrid as well, so it was still pretty good.

The grand update is completed now. We are not running the third tool &quot;Chisel&quot; because of some changes in the tool. We may run it later or during the next big update. We plan to get this done every two months for now, so the next big update should happen sometime in January next year. I will be running some smaller ones every week or two.

Coming back to the question of NFS issues, I think we should continue to work towards solving it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
