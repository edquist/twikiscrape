Internet2 / OSG Area Coordinators Update

Jeff Boote

perfSONAR-Performance-Toolkit (CD deployments)
   * 3.1.3(Apr) is current release
   * Drafting a security recommendations document to outline supported software and OS versions as well as considerations such as firewalls for the next major release
   * Next major release in development
      * Redhat (CentOS) based
      * Expect first release candidate mid-July
   * LHC USAtlas
      * USATLAS is recommending pS-PT for Tier 3s
      * Aiding USATLAS in hardware evaluations to recommend for Tier 3s
        * Testing a new machine config w/ MSU/UM.  Dell configuration, larger and beefier than KOI.  Has 10G cards too. Want to run all measurements on one machine instead of two.  Early in the process	
      * Internet2 will speak at T3 workshop on network preparation and performance
      * Engage in network debugging exercises with USATLAS participants now that tools have been stably deployed for a while
         * BNL to/from UC and UTexas Austin (Complete - found failing equipment)
         * OU and UTA ongoing
      * Aiding in USATLAS specific development work
         * GUIs - desire a USATLAS specific GUI. Using existing pS-PS APIs as a starting point
         * Alarms - desire alarms (nagios alerts) based on performance measurements. pS-PS development group has some under development, so USATLAS seems content to wait for those to be released before starting on their own
      * Working with Rik/Doug on recommendations for performance testing. Since the machine is in flux (no one wants to buy underpowered KOIs - and the Dells are too new and perhaps too expensive) this will stall a bit.  Will &#39;recommend&#39; people do things, but not force. (This effort could become part of the metrics deliverable for OSG)
   * LHC USCMS
      * Working with CMS participants and VOs (REDDnet) to instrument and make network data available
      * Encouraging adoption of pSPT similar to ATLAS, but nothing formal exists (Brazilian site seems active)
Performance Workshops
   * NSF/DOE supported workshop planned for July in D.C.
     * Focus is on trying to involve researchers in perfSONAR
     * Dan Fraser is attending
   * Additional workshop at Jt Techs geared more for Administrators/Operators and Users
   * Still working on a more Developer oriented workshop
Best Practices Guide (no change)
   * Only small updates needed from the one recommended for USAtlas ( [[http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/Tier2BCP]] )
   * Will likely do this in cooperation with the Internet2 PerfWG
   * Will work on an updated hardware recommendation
   * Reached out to Brian Bockelman but all of us have been overloaded as of late
