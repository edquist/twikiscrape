---++ Time line of web site, announcements, invitations, agenda
   * 3-4 (or earlier) months before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * Decide on the topic and goals of the meeting
      * Create a list of speakers to invite
      * Create a draft agenda
      * Make posters and postcards and publicity
      * Send invitation e-mail to the speakers (see attached e-mail drafts)
      * Create the meeting on the [[https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=77][Indico]] site as a conference. The information on these page should be updated often and should not be misleading.Get help from Fermilab people on issues with Indico. It is not always plain sailing.
       Include the following menu links ([[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=468][sample]]):
         * OSG Home Page (as an external link)
         * OSG Consortium All Hands Meeting (Meeting main top page). Contains information about the meeting, place, time, etc
         * Agenda (Timetable)
         * Registration (this will have a registration form page). Do not forget to add information about any registration fees, method of payment, social events
         * Accommodations. Contains information about hotels that are close to the conference site and any other useful information.
         * List of participants
         * Contact information
      * Meeting announcement soliciting attendance, prompt for registration
   * 2-3 months before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * It is advisable to keep the agenda outside of indico until it is more or less solid, it is a pain to move things around once entered into the indico timetable.
      * It is useful to have scribes, separate from session organizers, for action item lists from workshops. 
      * It is good to have an identified contact for &quot;administrative support for crises&quot;
      * Update agenda to what will be almost the final one.
         * Note that having fewer presentation and more panels, fewer slides and more discussion seems to be well received. We think this should be continued in the future.
         * We have continued co-located US ATLAS and US CMS meetings- Tier-2, Tier-2, Facility. This also works well and should be continued in the future
         * There have been problems with conflicting schedules with iSGC - Taiwan Grid Symposium, it is a good idea to check on this early
         * LIGO has a collaboration meeting in March. It would be good to have a gap between OSG AHM and aLIGO meetings and perhaps have a colocated aLIGO meeting in 2011 if possible
         * The Biology applications workshop could be a regularly scheduled item
         * we now traditionally invite students from the previous years schools/sponsorship to present
         * Remember OSG staff and contributors need BOF, small discussion time and give them rooms, breakfast, pizza as needed.
         *  &quot;lightening talks&quot;. The logistics of their attendance is paid for through Wisconsin OSG funds. It may be that having them give e-presentations is actually preferable.
      * if a speaker has declined the invitation send e-mail to alternate speaker and include a deadline for replying that is no closer to a month before the meeting.
      * Send e-mail to the attendees, announcing the agenda and prompt for registration again 
      * Make sure that the local organization understands that everyone will have 1 if not 2 or 3 network using devices at the meeting. Also that everyone needs power for their laptops during session. This is just life. 
   * 1 month before the  OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * Announce final agenda
      * Prompt speakers for input and registration if they have not done so
      * Check with local organizers the names people with hotel reservations and compare with registration list. 
        This needs to be done on almost daily bases as the meeting approaches to make sure that the speakers have reserved a room. 
         If not send them e-mail to remind them.
      * Check with the vendors and follow up.
      * Let speakers and sessions chairs know how to upload talks and encourage them to do it early.
   * Council Face to face
      * It is traditional to have a Council face to face meeting after the AHM. Make sure to work with the Council co-chairs and local organizers early on this. There is a council dinner the night before. 
   * Other events
      * Group photo shoot 
      * iSGTW coverage
      * Dinners
      * Tours
      * The 2010 vendor and e-presentation went well and we would propose you continue this. 
      * Handouts - it is nice to have OSG as well as local host handouts. these have a time lag to be available so do start early.
      * OSG newsletter articles; vignettes
   * After the event
      * The host or Executive Director send emails of appreciation to the plenary invitees, vendors, workshop organizers etc. 

---++ Time line for local organization
   * 6 months or as soon as possible before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * Reserve conference rooms for the event. All rooms should have videoconferencing and conference phones equipment. 
        For the plenary session the room should hold about 200 people. There are usually 3-4 parallel sessions, so appropriate rooms should be reserved. Parallel rooms need at least to hold 50 nowadays.
      * Make sure that there are network connections (wireless primarily)  and they are using standard ports for communication as outbound non-standard ports may be blocked and any demos would not work. Attendees often have multiple network devices with them. 
      * Conference center provides sufficient power outlets assuming one laptop per attendee.
      * Arrange for local administrative support before and during the meeting
         * before the meeting: to contact the hotels, reserve meeting rooms, arrange for any catering services, make name tags, make labels for the meeting rooms
         * during the meeting: register the attendees, give them their name tags, accept any payments, provide help with local facilities, 
             guide the catering people for timing
      *People just Do register at the last minute. We just have to prepare for and accommodate this. 2010 there were 183 attendees in all.
   * 3-4 months before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * Contact the local hotels and make sure that they can support the expected number of people (so far maximum number of participants was 183 people). If possible reserve an appropriate block of rooms.
      * If breakfast, lunch, dinner are to be provided contact appropriate catering services and start the arrangements
   * 2 months before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * Check with the hotels about their availability.
      * Place the order with the catering service
   * 1 month before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * contact catering
      * Check on EVO and phone availability and reservations. Most of the parallel sessions need phone and especially the LHC, LIGO meetings need EVO
   * 1 week before the meeting
      * make any labels for the rooms providing directions
   * 1 day before the OSG Consortium Meeting:
      * make name tags (this needs to be done as late as possible to have tags for late registration)
      * print any payment receipts
      * Make papers to alert speakers their time is nearly up : 2, 1, 0
