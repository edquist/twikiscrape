---+++ New Items for [[https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=86][OSG Calendar]], 
---+++ Current plan for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/NewsletterArticles][Newsletter Articles]]
Please note that all newsletter articles are due around the middle of the month before the targeted newsletter.

**We want to get an update on the area goals we had established at the staff retreat; these goals are available at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1217

Also please remember that the next OSG annual report for each area will explicitly state the goals and the results.

---++ Minutes
Goals:
   1. Demostrate 50k running job on OSG VO pool: started tests with sleep jobs; now at 24,000 jobs. Changing configuration to improve jobs running rate; need to define target rate (1 Hz per entry?).
   2. Is OSG opportunistic pool demand-limited? Not in the past 3 months
   3. Deliver at least 150M opportunistic hours in 12 months: on track.
   4. Deliver at least 10M opportunistic compute hours to mu2e: met (16M)
   5. Enable access of IF experiment data via Stashcache: targeting NOvA flux files
   6. Expand use of the OSG by the NOvA experiment to opportunistic sites: meeting with production coordintator
   7. Engage other IF experiments including those outside of FNAL to use the OSG infrastructure and tools: in progress
   8. LIGO goals: establish submission infrastructure for LIGO operated by OSG and Georgia Tech PACE cluster as an OSG site to accept LIGO jobs: met for simple payloads
   9. LIGO access to HPC and OSG opportunistic: in progress
   10. At-scale testing of opportunistic OSG resources for DES: in progress. Challenge is memory requirement
   11. Enable LSST computing on OSG: in progress
   12. Enable access to HPC resources via OSG-HPC-CE: : in progress for Comet
   13. Improve GratiaWeb: in progress: new plot types are being added


 Key Initiatives
   1. Improve accounting of opportunistic usage: 52M h in the past 3 months, ~ 20,000 slots per day
   2. Understand multicore resources on OSG


Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Cosmic (DES) not showing progress
   2. LIGO effort behind schedule but making progress
   3. Site integration process continues to be slow
   4. PNNL support for BestMan: discussing ticket escalation policy


Key Accomplishments
   1. See met goals...

Please let Bo or Chander know if there are questions.  Thanks, Gabriele
