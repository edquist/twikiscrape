*1.6.1 Strategy*

Campuses are where most scientists reside and where a large number of mid-range resources are located. Outreach to US campuses and technologies developed for campuses are therefore very important to OSG and the national cyberinfrastructure. The strategy for this fourth year is therefore to continue to contact campuses and help them develop their own grids and at the same time develop/integrate software and technologies to ease the integration of campuses in the national CI.
Key to outreach to two campuses is to develop a procedure to select which campus to outreach to instead of relying on an ad-hoc approach which often is not successful. 
Second is to continue the work from the previous year on use of BOINC on campus based windows resource and finish the integration of BOINC accounting with the OSG gratia accounting. Adding to these &quot;opportunistic&quot; technologies is the prototype the use of GridshibCA to access OSG resources, this technique is currently being tested on TeraGrid.
Finally cooperation with the education area will continue with the proposed development of a virtual OSG site to that could be deployed on campuses. This last strategy could be greatly enhanced, it stems from the fact that very little sites actually support the OSG EDU VO and from the fact that the biggest impediment to outreach to OSG resources is still the user of certificates. We propose to deploy an EDU testebed will more relaxed security setup and using a subset of the OSG framework (for instance no AIM) but adding new technologies like virtual applicance and virtual networks.

*1.6.2 Goals*

   1. Outreach to two more campuses
      1.1 Develop procedure to select campus
      1.2 First campus
      1.3 Second campus

   2. Opportunistic access
      2.1 Deploy BOINC/Gratia probe in a campus grid
      2.2 Work with security team to prototype Grishib CA to ease access to OSG with campus credentials.

   3. Develop Campus/Education testbed
      3.1 Package OSG site for OSG EDU VO using virtualization 
      3.2 Develop EDU/Campus testbed.
      3.3 Use Packaged OSG site in training
      3.4 Develop educational material for Campuses
