Key Initiatives
   1. Improvements to the perfSONAR-PS toolkit - Feeding back issues to developers
   2. OSG Modular dashboard: Datasetore is in integration mode. Problems in RSV-based data gathering. OSG Ops contributes tests and tools to run infrastructure in production.
   3. Documentation - minor updates / correction and more on IPv6


Top Issues / Concerns
   1. OSG Network Datastore: load is too high - concerns in gathering data and current hardware for Esmond
   2. Reliability of perfSONAR metrics gathering - some issues related to firewall or host-down; other issues possibly due to bugs in perfSONAR. Tests do not always complete.


Key Accomplishments
   1. Strong interactions with the WLCG community (sharing mesh-configs, tutorial of perfSONAR)
   2. Outreach - Participated at several venues: LHCONE/LHCOPN meetings, WLCG Network and transfer metrics WG
   3. PuNDIT satellite uses OSG as testbed in the integration of perfSONAR
