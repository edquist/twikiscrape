---+++ *Year 1 Status*

---++++ _End of Year Budget Update_

 Money for DOE Labs became available first; Followed by NSF moneys and SOWs to dispense. Labs used a higher percentage based on communications with finance officers. GriPhyN/iVDGL moneys used at UW for OSG effort. Board would like to see this added to the table to capture this. The amount is about $300K and it was fully utilized. Some DOE Labs have apparently used some of the moneys for the next 6 months during the first year. 

---++++ _Staffing Changes_

Most staffing changes associated with changes to SOWs and subcontracts. Overall hiring is progressing well. The is an expected minor increase in staffing in year two due to the savings in year 1 to get the work done. Would be useful to have a projection of staffing needs for the future. The profile for staffing presented to the institions in the beginning has a change in the 3rd year, which we need to start thinking about. No working assumtion after the 5 year funding ends. This was already an issue for the engagement moneys which only covered one year (and we are going after more money to address this). Ruth suggests adding two slides to staffing &quot;story&quot; to capture these expectations down the road. High level positions (deputy level) are difficult to aquire and transition into.  Need to show tail-out where we need funding.

---++++ _Change Requests (Summary)_

Some ambiguity in the need for change requests is related to the need for more complete reporting on tasks that are overdue. Reporting is useful, but making it efficient is also useful.

---++++ _Completion of WBS_

WBS used to develop a plan that we as a community buy into. As of 24 hours ago, 100% reporting achieved. ATLAS not in a position to step up the storage resources software so this is why this agency milestone less than 100%. Each of the science milestones that are not at 100% do in fact meet the needs of the science communities involved. Some science milestones moved from year 1 into year 2. We need to capture these as they are completed in year two. Absolute numbers for these science milestones hinges on the science community actually exercising the systems at that level, e.g., if they submit at only half the rate but OSG meets 100% of this need, we should not be reporting 50% because of the inability of the science community to submit at the rate needed for 100%.

---++++ _Status of Reporting_

This years JOT meeting in January 08 will include external reviewers. Bill will not be available to attend the JOT External Review in January. Coupling handing out of funds with reporting has some challenges given that we hand out once a year but may be important for leverage. It would be best to find a carrot for reporting.

---++++ _Lessons from Year 1_

(Action Item) Need a histogram (out of the statement of work) captureing the distribution of the % level of effort each staff member is doing on OSG. Also would be interested in tracking the time on the project (retention) each staff person is on the project. (two charts).

---+++ *Year 2 Status and Planning*

---++++ _Year 2 Budget; including contingency_

Year 2 budget now being implemented. Overall, about 4 weeks more work schedule than planned back in May but we are in very good shape. NSF funding comes on Sept 1 and lines up with our yearly schedule, which starts on Oct 1, better than the scheduled DOE funding arrival dates. This is captured in the slide for year 2 budget plan. Question of whether our year 2 staff expansion is because we underestimated what is required to do OSG or whether staff expansion is just what is needed to do some extra work.
Add information to budget chart to capture enabling funding. Must watch cost at end of year 2 very carefully to understand impact of way we are applying the savings. This was driven by consortium and should be noted. 

---++++ _Status of WBS_

Tracking new focus areas for year 2 needs to be called out; this should include calling out the associated WBS items and have specialized reporting to the executive team quarterly and if there is an issue bump it up to monthly reporting. Need to balance out the long term project goals with the &quot;fire&quot; fighting and recognize how these two compete with each other and introduce staffing issues. Also need to be able to track progress on the &quot;fire&quot; fighting efforts - was it successfully addressed and reported as being completed.

---++++ _Staff Plan_

All staffing is within the rim of what is expected, the deltas all line up. Need a statement about RENCI effort. Need to show where roll over money is being used on this slide 17. Need to show that in moviing to year 2 there is a reduction in funding. Similarly this happens again in year 5 from DOE. Need to show funding profile for each of the five years (for JOT External).

---++++ _Status of SOWs_

Better to show the histogram by completion instead of by alphabetical ordering. If they are all completed, show completion week by week. Both of these suggestions would be useful for JOT External Review. (include last year&#39;s progress shadowed on this)

---++++ _Reporting Changes for Year 2_

Stressed area coordinator reports in SOWs this year. Need a carrot. Need to be think of ways to do this. Possibly involving agencies in some way.

---++++ _Closing Comments_

Jim, as someone not involved on a daily basis, is very impressed. Miron asked how do we convey this to the reviewers? One answer would be to show the derivatives from last year. If Finance board provided an assessment of progress, that could be used for a starting point. Recommend turning this into a report and present to the council by resource managers on Tuesday November 13th Noon Chicago Time. Jim will provide some bullet comments to be included in report to council.
