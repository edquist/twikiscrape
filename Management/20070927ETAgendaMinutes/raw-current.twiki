---+ Agenda &amp; Meeting Notes
Attending: Paul, Chander,  Ruth, Doug, Mike W, Alain, Miron
Apologies: Frank, 

The challenges of being matrixed as an OSG staff member. How to ensure a healthy culture for such a distributed, matrixed organization. Miron tells everyone in his organization that they can only take instruction from himself. There is collaboration and people are talking to each other, but taking responsibilities should be at a limited space and should have good communication with the line manager. Things are suggestions rather than &quot;have to&quot;. Important to have good communication. Miron does not like the idea of a separate technical. Caltech does not let Kent be the technical nor the line manager. The line manager at Caltech is a professor. Explicitly factor in stresses of &quot;loaning&quot; from one institution to another, and in the responsibilities that are given to new people. Who is the &quot;HR&quot; person of OSG? 

Issue:  Line manager knows nothing about OSG in any form?  

Issue: Remote project  or activity manager not up to date on personnel, personal problems of the staff member and in contact sufficiently frequently?

Action Items:
Feedback on Caltech job description by end of Friday.
Kent to arrange phone meeting between Caltech line management and the Executive Team. 
Discussion is the resources managers. Can have a recommendation for additional staff to take on such responsibilities.

No major issues but a lot of work ongoing. Problem with the BDII reporting correctly last week. Focusing on fixing the infrastructure to ensure alerted when there are problems. Involving the Troubleshooting team to understand what we need to ensure the monitoring system is working reliably.

---++ Year2 Planning Update

Added a sentence to the Template to capture responsibilities when there is change in personnel. 
Paul, Kent and Chander have scheduled two meetings a week to go over the SOWs once they are signed by the organizational PIs. 
Dual roles as organizational PI and OSG role. People do treat these differently.
Perhaps write up the process as the &quot;OSG Statements of Work&quot; explaining how signatures work. Given the structure individuals may sign more than once.
