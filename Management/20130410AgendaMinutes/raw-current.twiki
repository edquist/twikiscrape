---+++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. OSG-XSEDE usage increased at 1M hours / week - continuing to improve the integration with XSEDE infrastructure, recently to automate user allocation policies - Extending available resources to include Fermilab CMS Tier 1 (for users with certificates)
   2. Public Storage - slow continuous increase of usage by small communities. Recently using iRODS for the deployment of large input data (20GB) for the Snowmass group. - Involving operations and technology areas to prepare recommendations to ET in one month on how to move forward with this service

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. OSG public storage - supporting small communities. Concerns about maintenance load if moved to production for the fraction of user community served.
   2. Opportunistic capacity on OSG is still hard to estimate. This affects how we set expectations with customers, including OSG-XSEDE
   3. Snowmass support requires more effort than initially envisioned. Working to contain scope creep and operational load for long jobs, data archiving, and submit capacity.

On the horizon
   1. Continue support of Snowmass - 2M hours used so far, possibly 5M hours more needed
   2. No end-user certificate at Fermilab. Targeting OSG VO initially.
   3. Develop validation of project-name accounting for OSG-XSEDE clients flocking from portals to XSEDE

Key Accomplishments
   1. Successfully executed the mission. No special activity from supported communities.
