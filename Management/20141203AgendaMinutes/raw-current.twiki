      * Contribute patches upstream to broader distributions as appropriate &amp;ndash; very low priority

      * Expand coverage of components and test cases &amp;ndash; needs planning
      * Improve expressiveness of test infrastructure &amp;ndash; brainstorming session in mid-December or early January

---+++ Top Concerns

   * HTCondor CE transition has seen many challenges, but I think that we are getting into the long tail of deployment support and refinement. Nonetheless, an earlier start and/or less aggressive schedule would have been best.

   * The backlog of useful work is still significant. We are tracking overall progress and working on it, but slowly. Put another way, our rate of ticket completion is at or just slighly above the rate of incoming tickets. Internal projects, including important ones like setting up our Madison ITB site, are wholly starved of effort.

&lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/osg-software-jira-tix-20141203.png&quot; alt=&quot;osg-software-jira-tix-20141203.png&quot; width=&#39;600&#39; height=&#39;371&#39; /&gt;

   * There has been little to no effort put into documentation lately. We are shifting the responsibility for this area back to Software and will draft a plan to address missing, incomplete, and out-of-date documents. !TimC needs to get this area rolling, but has had limited time.

   * Many of the OSG Software team are &amp;le; 40% effort. Given the overhead of context switching, etc., our total productivitity is not the same as fewer full-time people totaling the same effort. So we are organizing work in terms of larger and smaller tasks, with bigger, more important tasks being assigned to &amp;ge; 50% staff.
