Location: Mexico City, Mexico

Owner: Experimental High Energy Physics (EHEP) group at CINVESTAV

Number of Cores: 142

Used by: CMS, DZero, students and faculty in the Physics department at CINVESTAV and collaborators from Mexican institutions.

What sort of opportunistic access do you offer to other VOs?
At least half of the computing (64 cores) are always available on an opportunistic basis.
 
What is the best part of collaborating with and contributing to OSG?
Learning from other OSG sites and having access to the GRID infrastructure.

What is unusual about your site?
Despite limited resources, we have had a local cluster for doing data analysis for more than 10 years. Currently, we are the only site in Mexico collaborating with OSG.

What are the greatest challenges your site faces?
A network bottleneck. The network bandwidth to and from Mexico is very limited, from time to time we experience serious access problems to other sites.

What projects are you working on at your site?
We are increasing data store and computing capabilities for the cluster and CINVESTAV is getting better network access.

*UCSD Campus Infrastructure Science Usage*

The UCSD Experimental Particle Physics group operates the CMS Tier-2 center and the glideinWMS services provided by OSG.  As a spin-off to these activities, we are now offering computing services to local scientists across campus. This started with personal relationships that were formed through teaching or service on committees, and expanded from there. 

Today, friends at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics operate the login platform, the OSG-engage group provides support via a &quot;UCSDGrid&quot; group in their VOMS, and the particle physics group provides knowledge and support. The science conducted this way so far includes Astrophysics, Biology, Chemistry, Climate Science, Engineering, and Oceanography.

Example science projects include: Using NASA satellite images to study cloud formation along shipping routes; study of protein structure; analyzing WMAP data to study the topology of the universe or to create a map of dark matter in the universe via gravitational lensing; searching for whale sounds in data collected with hydrophones in the pacific; studying the way students learn in Mechanical Engineering by analyzing their keystrokes as recorded by special pens throughout the quarter; and much more. 
Looking forward, we are hoping to expand our services across the UC system both in terms of the scientific as well as the IT communities.

Comments are welcome.

*OSG Operations*

With OSG recently topping the 14M hours per week mark,[1] OSG Operational services are also seeing record levels of stability. Of the 15 monitored infrastructures over the past 30 days, the average availability is 99.92% and the critical services (BDII and MyOSG) are operating at 100% availability [2]. One of the most telling signs of stability is marked not in the metrics mentioned above, but found in listening to the community on the daily WLCG Operations calls and the weekly OSG Operations and Production meetings. While important issues are still being addressed during these meetings, much of this time includes VO representatives mentioning how smoothly production is running.
 
Operationally, this stability with existing services has allowed us to focus our attention on upcoming changes to the PKI process and to providing additional dedicated effort to ensuring the DOEGrids to DigiCert Certificate Authority transition goes smoothly for users and resource administrators as well as for the infrastructure services mentioned above.

*ExTENCI Science Results*

Extending science Through Enhanced National Cyber Infrastructure (ExTENCI) is a joint project of the Open Science Grid (OSG),TeraGrid (TG) and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), funded by the [[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1007115][National Science Foundation]].   This project, composed of four technology enhancements in the areas of job submission, wide-area file system, and virtual machines, just completed an interim assessment of the use of the ExTENCI technologies by science projects.  It found work being done in protein structure, theoretical chemistry, earth science, high energy physics, sociology, and RNA sequencing that has used almost 1.4 million CPU hours on OSG and 250 thousand SUs on XSEDE.  Eight papers have been published, three are in preparation, and several papers and presentations have been made on the technologies.  Please view details [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1111][here]].

*Education Schools*

June 25-28th sees the next in the OSG Summer School Series – this year renamed as the OSG User School. About 25 students are in Madison to learn many aspects of how to use distributed high-throughput computing (DHTC) systems locally, remotely through the OSG, and/or on other XSEDE service provider systems. The students provide us with a great venue for involving new users, new needs and new approaches. The teaching provides us with experience in describing and showing our services in a clear, understandable and complete way. The User School [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Education/UserSchool12Materials][materials]] providegood input to the OSG technical documentation for the future.

*From the OSG Blogs*

This month’s [[http://blogs.grid.iu.edu/][blogs]] combine two threads. One is from “spinning Matt” giving lots of useful information about monitoring Schedd’s, Condor pool utilization,  and information about using Hadoop MapReduce. The other is about RENCI’s use of a new workflow system called Grayson built on top of Pegasus, GlideinWMS, Condor and Globus for hierarchical workflow management across OSG and XSEDE resources. 

Keep them coming!
