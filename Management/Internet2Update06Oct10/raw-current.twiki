perfSONAR-Performance-Toolkit (CD deployments)
   * 3.2RC4 is in final acceptance testing, final release expected in the next week or two
      * Redhat (CentOS) based
      * Ran into network performance problems with BIC congestion control algorithm in latest kernels which took a couple of weeks to figure out.
   * LHC USAtlas
      * Still aiding USATLAS in hardware evaluations to recommend for Tier 3s
      * Continue to engage in network debugging exercises with USATLAS participants now that tools have been stably deployed for a while
         * no current issues.
      * Aiding in USATLAS specific development work
         * GUIs - desire a USATLAS specific GUI. Using existing pS-PS APIs as a starting point
         * Alarms - desire alarms (nagios alerts) based on performance measurements. pS-PS development group has some under development, so USATLAS seems content to wait for those to be released before starting on their own
            * Development is mostly complete on this and the nagios plugins will be tested at T2 sites in the next month.
Performance Workshops
   * NSF/DOE supported workshop in July in D.C.
     * Focus was on trying to involve researchers in perfSONAR
   * Additional workshop at Jt Techs geared more for Administrators/Operators and Users
   * Still working on a more Developer oriented workshop
   * Workshop at OSG all hands meeting
       * Plan to support workshop at future meetings with more focused content
Best Practices Guide (no change)
   * Only small updates needed from the one recommended for USAtlas ( [[http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/Tier2BCP]] )
   * Will likely do this in cooperation with the Internet2 PerfWG
   * Will work on an updated hardware recommendation
   * Reached out to Brian Bockelman but all of us have been overloaded as of late
