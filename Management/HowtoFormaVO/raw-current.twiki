---+++ &quot;I want to form a new VO&quot; 

To form a Virtual Organization (VO) that participates in the Open Science Grid, the following is required:

A Charter statement describing the purpose of the VO. This should be concise, yet long enough to scope intended usage of OSG resources.

A VO Membership Service which meets the requirements of an OSG Release. This means being able to provide a full list of members&#39; DNs to edg-mkgridmap. The currently recommended way to do this is to deploy the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/VOAlphabetSoup#VOMS_and_its_extensions][VOMS package]] from the OSG software package.

A support organization (called a Support Center in OSG parlance) that will support the VO in OSG Operations. The Support Center should provide at least the following:
a written description of the registration process, 
   * instructions for the members of the VO on how to complete the VO registration process, 
   * instructions for the members of the VO on how to report problems and/or obtain help.

Completion of the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/home][registration form]] using these [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMRegistrationInstructions][instructions]].

After you submit the registration form, the OSG Operations Activity will review the information. If there are no issues preventing acceptance, they will send a welcome email message, add support for your VO to the OSG software infrastructure, OSG operations and support activities, and published web pages. They will add the VOMS administrator and the VO manager to the vo-admins email list. If questions or issues arise, the Operations Activity will work with the VO and the OSG executive board to resolve them.
