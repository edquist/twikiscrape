---++ Old Description

*Note:* The description below was last updated many years ago and is no longer completely accurate.

The Management, Operation, Trash/Extensions of the OSG Facility is managed by the Executive Team, which responds to the stakeholder requirements and develops and executes the plan for deployment of the OSG infrastructure. The Executive Board members are listed [[Management.ExecutiveBoard][here]].

Executive Team meetings are on Thursdays bi-weekly at 12:00 pm.

Much of the Executive Team business is conducted through email and other e-communication. The Executive Team is a decision making body, with decisions endorsed by the Executive Board and Council. For technology and policy decisions normally the ET designates a member of the EB to be responsible for preparing a recommendation to present to the ET. 

Since phone ET meetings are typically in depth discussions of a single topic, with some private aspects, we do not normally post agendas and minutes. However sometimes we do!
