---++ Virtual Organizations Group

Last reported at the Area Coordinator&#39;s Meeting on [[20090611ETAgendaMinutes][June 11, 2009]]. 

---+++ FY3 2008-09 Summary
   
   * Year3 ground work and impact on at-large VOs&#39; Production:
      * Work was planned and executed jointly; effort shared between OSG and key experts from VOs.
      * &lt;u&gt;Dzero&lt;/u&gt; pulled up from 15-30% (30-50K hours/day) efficiency to 60-80% (80-120K hours/day). Resulted in new monte-carlo production peaks, and D0&#39;s own internal taskforces. Qizhong Li pointed out in July&#39;09 that joint effort has led to an interesting practical metric: &quot;a publication per week&quot; due to MC production on OSG. 
      * &lt;u&gt;Fermilab-VO&#39;s&lt;/u&gt; !TeraGrid gateway picked up from near-0 activity, and was refocused with D0 as a real user. 
      * &lt;u&gt;Geant4&lt;/u&gt; re-started up to use OSG for its regression cycles in June&#39;09 and Nov&#39;09.
      * &lt;u&gt;CDF&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;STAR&lt;/u&gt; have tangible plans and needs. Not all needs were met, but good potential for success.
      * &lt;u&gt;ALICE&lt;/u&gt; started up in the US. Resulted in formation of US ALICE&#39;s internal plan for a Tier-2 Facility, to be jointly established at NERSC/LBNL and LLNL. 
      * &lt;u&gt;nanoHUB&lt;/u&gt; pulled from near-0 to 500 hrs/day with application jobs. Resulted in influx of user jobs toward OSG resources. 
      * &lt;u&gt;SBGrid&lt;/u&gt; pulled from 0 to 2000 hrs/day (from a VO usage view), and from 0 functional sites to 2 functional sites (community grid view). Usage dropped down to 0-20 hrs/day in latter-half of FY3. Ramp up and expansion planned for FY4.
      * Increased focus on &lt;u&gt;IceCube&lt;/u&gt;. Formation of plans for scale-out from GLOW to other OSG sites.
      * &lt;u&gt;CompBioGrid, GPN, GROW&lt;/u&gt; have good potential. Attempt was made to pull up activity, and to make a plan.

   * Management staff of VOs providing direct input of Plans &amp; Requirements to EB and Council: 15+ 
   * Official Reports presented to the EB and Council: August&#39;09 and March&#39;09.
   * Scientific Publications collected for Annual NFS Report: 100+ (Work done with OSG Communications Area)
 
   * OSG 1.2 pre-release validation on ITB 1.1:
      * VOs participating: 13 
      * ATLAS, ALICE, CDF, CMS, Dzero, DES, DOSAR, Engage-VO, Fermilab-VO, LIGO, nanoHUB, SBGrid, STAR.
      * Strict punctuality of closure deadline: VOs validation opened and closed within 3 weeks. 
      * As trade-off in timeline, only a subset of VOs performed a thorough validation.
   * OSG 1.0.1 pre-release validation on ITB 0.9.2:   
      * VOs participating: 6
      * ATLAS, CDF, CMS, Dzero, Fermilab-VO, LIGO.
      * Strict punctuality of closure deadline: VOs validation opened and closed within 4 weeks.
      * Work done with OSG Sites and Trash/Trash/Integration Area.
   * VOs participating in Weekly VO Forums: 15+
      * Usual attendance by representatives of: CDF, Dzero, DES, Fermilab-VO, ILC, nanoHUB, NYSGrid, SBGrid/NEBioGrid. 
      * Increased focus was put on VOs with limited activity: !CompBioGrid, GPN, GUGrid, GROW, !IceCube, MARIACHI.
   * OSG Areas directly interacting with VOs in Weekly VO Forums: 
      * Security, Storage, Communications, Operations/GOC, WMS, Engagement. 
      * As trade-off in scope of discussions, context of operational Security and its implication on VOs was not clear.     
   * VOs that were closed in FY3: 2 
      * &lt;u&gt;GUGrid, MARIACHI&lt;/u&gt;.
      * Decision based on each&#39;s self-assessment. Due to lack of activity/funds.
   * New VO registrations in OIM/GOC that were vetted and stopped: 2
      * &lt;u&gt;MinerVa&lt;/u&gt;, merged into Fermilab-VO. 
      * &lt;u&gt;CALICE&lt;/u&gt;, persuaded to get an official plan or to merge into ILC.
   * New VO registrations in OIM/GOC that were vetted and cleared: 3 
      * &lt;u&gt;GROW, JDEM, !NEBioGrid&lt;/u&gt;.  
   * FY3 WBS Items that were not completed / in need of improvement:
      * # 1.4.1.2.3 - Organize annual face-to-face meeting of at-large VOs.
      * # 1.4.1.4 - Assist in planning of new software features with Project Management and Software/VDT teams.
      * # 1.4.3.3 - Encourage more VOs to make transition to using SRM-based opportunistic storage.
      
---+++ FY4 2009-10 Plan

   * VOs opportunistic utilization and production efficiency:
      * In phase with LHC startup, gauge any limitations of opportunistic resource availability for other VOs on OSG.
      * Monitor accounting data and characteristics of VOs. Use both views - OSG Accounting and VOs Accounting.
      * Preemption/Eviction is a prevalent characteristic in opportunistic grid usage. With ET&#39;s direction, commission a recommendation/solution for adoption by affected VOs.
      * With ET&#39;s direction, organize and lead Joint !TaskForces to rapidly resolve wide-range matters for specific VOs. Ensure closure within 4-6 weeks.
   * Analyze portfolio of functional VOs and recommend needed actions to the ET:
      * Value delivery to Group 1: &lt;u&gt;D0, CDF, Fermi-VO&lt;/u&gt;.
      * Value delivery to Group 2: &lt;u&gt;DES (+ JDEM), DOSAR, ILC, STAR&lt;/u&gt;.
      * Value delivery to Group 3: &lt;u&gt;Geant4, NYSGrid&lt;/u&gt;.
      * Quarterly executive summary to ET on functional VOs.
   * Manage portfolio of VOs that have limited activity:
      * &lt;u&gt;IceCube&lt;/u&gt;: Phased expansion on OSG using glideinWMS and Squid/SRM Storage.
      * &lt;u&gt;ALICE&lt;/u&gt;: Phased increase in operations on OSG. Execute USALICE plan on NERSC &amp; LLNL, and/or VO-Box at GLOW.
      * &lt;u&gt;CompBioGrid, GPN, GROW, nanoHUB&lt;/u&gt;: Specialized support to enable gradual increase in quantitative activity; evaluate results.
      * &lt;u&gt;NEBioGrid, SBGrid&lt;/u&gt;: If needed, work together to manage gradual increase in quantitative activity.
      * &lt;u&gt;CIGI, GRASE, NWICG&lt;/u&gt;: Assess availability of roadmaps.
      * With ET&#39;s direction, assess viability (and closure) of a VO if success-roadmap and value proposition is unclear.
      * &lt;u&gt;New VO registrations in GOC&lt;/u&gt;: Evaluate clarity of plan, and assist EB in deciding approval or denial of registration.
      * &lt;u&gt;New VO formations via Engagement&lt;/u&gt;: Work with Engagement &amp; !Trash/Trash/CampusGrids area to assess/execute plan.
      * Quarterly executive summary to ET on inactive VOs.
   * Organize a forum for regular stakeholder interaction:
      * Organize Weekly-VO-Forum teleconferences, inviting select VOs and peer OSG Areas.
      * Organize !F2F Annual OSG VOs &amp; Users Meeting.
      * Organize !F2F meetings with specific VOs as needed.
      * Serve as conduit for peer OSG Areas to facilitate at-large VOs matters. E.g., Content Mgt, Software, Sites Coordination, Storage, Scalability/Reliability/Usability.
      * Collect VOs scientific publications (&lt;u&gt;including ATLAS, CMS, LIGO&lt;/u&gt;) for annual DOE &amp; NSF reports.
   * Stakeholder participation in OSG planning and software:
      * Organize periodic collection of VOs plans and requirements. Communicate VOs direct input to Council.
      * Plan and execute pre-release software validation by VOs (&lt;u&gt;including ATLAS, CMS, LIGO&lt;/u&gt;) on ITB.
      * Manage and track VOs software requirements.
