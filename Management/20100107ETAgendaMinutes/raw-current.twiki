---+++ Metrics

The Year 3 metrics report and evaluation was circulated. Comments are welcome to guide the Year 4 metrics work. Due to other priorities within OSG, Brian will transition this work to Jim and Ruth, while remaining as a consultant.

Brian, Jim, Ruth assessed the Year 4 metrics with the following comments:

For FY09  we took a different tack and asked each area coordinator to define goals and measurements (bottom up).  In  FY07 and FY08 we defined &quot;top down&quot; goals and measurements. At the start of FY09 Brian had discussions in a couple of Area Coordinators meeting and contacted each area coordinator to define and then measure the goals. He then worked with them to write the document.

For FY10 I am asking Jim Weichel to work with me over the next 2 months on defining the metrics. This is partly because of Brians load and current contributions in other areas: the ASCR display; user support and documentation; WLCG reporting; space accounting and shared storage. Brian, Jim and I talked this morning. Here is Brian&#39;s feedback from the last years work:

Difference with a bottom up approach had to encourage with people who did not see the worth in the activity. regarded as an additional chore to be got done quickly.
&lt;br&gt;   e.g. Storage - was straightforward
&lt;br&gt; Software - was difficult. how to put &quot;numbers&quot; with meaning to a measure?
 &lt;br&gt;          Integration - was non responsive. This area does report metrics in the area coordinators report.
  &lt;br&gt;         VO Group - changed metrics to match available measurements at the end of the FY. 

No/very few trend measurements to show how areas changed from FY08 to FY09. Should we be more explicit on this in the future?

Metrics goal to define &quot;what is a success&quot; and &quot;what is a failure&quot;. This is not captured in the task oriented nature of the WBS. Can it be?

Recommendation for Fy10 to go for a middling approach. Add area coordinators definition of success/failure as metrics in the WBS.  Have some other metrics  with top down goals.

We discussed who the audience is for the metrics:
&lt;br&gt;    FY07 and FY08: Project management and agency sponsors. Metrics were top down. Year 1 we were told they were inadequate. Year 2 presenting the metrics at the Review was productive.
&lt;br&gt;    FY09: Project management and area coordinators.  There was some introduction to the concepts and methods but no regular follow up with socialization. If we ask the area coordinators if the metrics gave them any insight on how and what they are working on what will they say? We will find out.

For FY10 project metrics I am therefore thinking of the following scope:


   1 metrics that speak to the value of OSG as we have defined it in the &quot;Value of OSG&quot; document.
   1 metrics that speak to our delivery of the program of work as defined in the original proposal
   1 follow up on internal metrics for each area coordinator to measure their work within the structure of the WBS

In our thinking to use some of these metrics  when defining our next proposals. 

---+++ Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment of Core Services provide to U.S. ATLAS and U.S. CMS by OSG.

Request from LHC Program Managers to US ATLAS, US CMS and OSG management to Assess nature and cost of Core Services provided to U.S. ATLAS and U.S. CMS by OSG. The report is due Feb 26th. We will work with Jim, Torre, Michael, Lothar, Frank, Ken on this report. We plan a discussion at the &quot;osg futures&quot; meeting on Jan 20/21st. OSG ET will meet again on Jan 14th. Ruth will send round EGI, EMI and ROSCOE proposals. Chander will send the effort plots from the review and make an initial list of core services for discussion at that meeting.
