---+ Opportunistic Storage Increases Grid Job Success Rate


 The DZero high-energy physics experiment at Fermilab typically submits 60,000-100,000 jobs per week at 23 sites. The experiment’s application executables make many requests for input data in quick succession.  Due to the lack of storage local to the processing sites, up until recently, much of DZero’s data had to be transferred in real time over the wide area network, leading to high latencies, job timeouts and job failures.

Joel Snow, head of the DZero Monte Carlo simulation production effort, studied these problems and determined that the local storage element was the key to improving efficiency. After reporting his findings to OSG, OSG subsequently worked with member institutions to allow DZero to use opportunistic storage--idle storage on shared machines at several sites. This represents the first successful deployment of opportunistic storage on OSG and opens the door for other OSG Virtual Organizations. With allocations of up to 1 TB at sites where it processes jobs, DZero has increased its job success rate from roughly 30% to upwards of 85%.

Hosting storage resources is often tricky in terms of hardware and professional expertise, especially for smaller grid sites, says Abhishek Singh Rana, coordinator of the Virtual Organizations group in OSG, which helps science communities achieve good results using the OSG. For this reason, the VO group negotiated with the larger OSG science communities, US ATLAS and US CMS, to allow other OSG communities to use their storage resources opportunistically. So far, DZero has used such storage at six US-LHC Tier-2 sites and is looking for more.

 Work to improve DZero’s job efficiency began in early July and by early August, the experiment was producing about 3.7 million events per week.  By the third week of September, the production rate was a record 11M events per week--more than 130% above DZero’s average weekly OSG production rate for the past year. 

DZero’s success demonstrates the OSG’s stance on the importance of establishing relationships with its user communities in order to benefit all members.

 “We are committed to the goals of the OSG, and that includes the development of opportunistic resources,” says Ken Bloom, manager of the CMS Tier-2 centers in the US. “When the OSG works well, all VOs can benefit.  If we can help get opportunistic storage working for D0, then maybe D0 sites will be able to make some of their storage opportunistically available to CMS, and if we can make good use of that, the reward will be well worth the effort.”

OSG is continuing to work with its stakeholders and resource providers to improve the mechanism for using opportunistic storage. CDF and SBGrid have also expressed an interest in using opportunistic storage in the future. Recommendations based on the DZero use scenario for how OSG sites can enable opportunistic storage have been published.
