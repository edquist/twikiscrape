---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. CI Logon Basic CA IGTF accredited - it will be distributed on OSG.
   2. OSG Identity Management Roadmap: alternatives to DigiCert exist (docdb 1185). Solution: XSEDE is running the CILogon Net Hardware Security Module (HSM) to sign certificate: developed prototype of OIM using CILogon Net HSM to issue certificates.
   3. Simplifying the onboarding of new users in OSG Connect through OSG IdP. Users authenticate once with OSG IdP using their certificate and get access to OSG Connect.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Handling DigiCert process issues handling certificate revocation list. Hard to test fixes before they go to production.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Operational Security: dealt with Heartbleed, bitcoin mining, dcache vulnerabilities
