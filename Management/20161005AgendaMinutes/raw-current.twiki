---++  Rob Gardner - User Support Campus Grids

   * Overview
      * OSG-XD, -Direct, -Connect systems heavily used and operating with good efficiency
         * 146M hours previous 12 months
         * Significant change is adding quota system to /home server on -Connect and training users to utilize local scratch and stash for larger datasets 
      * In good shape w.r.t. target metrics (active users, CPU-hours)
         * An exception is the connect-client which hasn&#39;t been a success (yet at least)
      * Emelie now back from maternity leave

   * !FreeSurfer:
      * V2 is available in beta testing (provides user options for &quot;custom&quot; transformations)
      * Documentation re-worked, under review: http://bit.ly/freesurferopensciencegrid
      

   * !Xenon1T:
      * Deployed !Xenon1T OASIS stratum 1 server to allow automated deploy (their favorite tool is !DeployHQ). *done*
      * Working to get the transfer tools (gfal2) compatible with their python.  *done*
      * Helping get LNGS into LHCONE (*in progress*) 
      * Rucio service and 4 major endpoints deployed (Nikhef, LNGS, UC-RCC, UC-Stash)  *done*
         * Working with Stockholm post doc to integrate with Xenon production system
         * Xenon Rucio clients to be installed in OASIS
      * We have assisted !Xenon1T to deploy a full featured distributed data management system

   * Campus integration
      * Proculus cluster at Stanford in production using a Bosco CE hosted at UC [[https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/payload-jobs-summary?var-VOName=All&amp;var-Project=All&amp;var-Facility=HOSTED_STANFORD&amp;var-User=All&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d][GRACC]]
      
   * !StashCache:
      * UC summer student worked on systematic load testing.  Now complete.  
      * New (python-based) version of stashcp (deployed in OASIS, available as a module)
      * Will make this part of standard introduction for new users

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Adding quota on /home on -Connect to train users to utilize scratch and stash.
   2. FreeSurfer v2 available in beta. Challenging because 2-steps removed from user community.
   3. Xenon1T: making good progress towards running their code in EGI and OSG. Supported deployment of Rucio for data handling. Some challenges related to their effort availability.
   4. StashCache: load testing complete; developed new stashcp, to be made a standard tool.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Emelie now back from maternity leave

Key Accomplishments
   1. Meeting most metric targets for 2016. Reached 146M h in 1 year. Connect-client metrics behind, but low risk.
   2. Proculus cluster at Stanford in production using a Bosco CE hosted at UC
