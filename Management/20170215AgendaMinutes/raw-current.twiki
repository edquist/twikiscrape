---++ Security, by Susan Sons
---+++ Vulnerabilities since 13 Jan 2017:

   1. Followed up on Ansible remediation from 09Jan CVE (used to manage configuration on some OSG infrastructure, not a piece of software we distribute).
   2. SLURM vuln (CVE-2016-10030) reported 05Jan, announced by SLURM team on 10Jan, packages to roll out for all OSG platforms available 21Jan.  We had an announcement to site admins and security contacts on 24Jan.
   3. Singularity vulnerability discovered around 06Feb, coordinated release on 14Feb to coincide with OSG release cycle.

---+++ Current working priorities:

   * Operations (always)
   * Collaborating with Rob Quick&#39;s team to get OSG software analyzed in the SWAMP.
   * Working with Brian B on host certificate automation.
   * Year 6 planning
   * All Hands Meeting Prep
   * Increased automation of Sec Team processes

---+++ Upcoming:

   * Sec Team documentation cleanup soon to kick off

---+++ Notes / Miscellany:

   * We&#39;ve also been watching and acting as a resource for projects such as Marina Krenz&#39;s efforts to research a new Single Sign On solution for OSG.
   * The recent survey (thanks Kyle for helping us get it out!) received only six responses, but was none the less helpful in learning what our community is concerned about.



---++ Minutes

*Attendees:* Brian L., Ken, Kyle, Mat, Rob Q., Scott, Shawn, Susan, Tim C., Tim T.

---+++ Security
   * Of the three recent vulnerabilities that affected OSG, the Singularity update was notable for how well the coordination between the developer and OSG worked. In contrast, the Slurm release was not as well coordinated, and so Susan plans to get to know the Slurm development team better to improve future security-related releases there.
   * Current projects are going well
   * Main concerns have to do with personnel and effort changes from Year 5 to Year 6. The Security Area is working hard to make sure that institutional knowledge is preserved through the transition. One bonus is that there may be some contributed effort of past Security Team members for a bit longer to ease the transition. Also, there is recognition that fewer total FTEs in the Security Area means that there will be less effort available to large projects. On the other hand, they hope to realize some efficiencies by automating routine tasks.

---+++ Action items
   * Susan will work on getting to know the Slurm developers better to improve coordination of security releases
   * Susan has requested access to !DocDB and Kyle will approve the request when he gets it; then, Susan will confirm with Tim&amp;nbsp;C. that she has sufficient access rights
