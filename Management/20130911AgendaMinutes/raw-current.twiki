Key Initiatives
   1. HTCondor-CE: released yesterday: now focusing on adding batch systems types.
   2. gWMS usability: working on different fronts. Parrot integration estimated for in October: will allow VOs that rely on OASIS to utilize more sites; Work on grid exerciser (RSV for VOs) in Sep; improve file transfer plugins and WN environment validation (proxies, CVMFS working, etc).
   3. OASIS v2: improving monitoring and automation

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Need to clarify OSG strategy for clients. Observations: (1) VO access to resources is not happening with more deployments of gWMS FE: are we moving towards the model of a  single FE for multiple schedd? (2) Client packages and documentation should modernize (today it is based on Condor-G).
   2. gWMS v3 Factory: estimated to be delayed of one month. Affected dependencies: Condor-CE, Cloud provisioning, improvements on usability and packaging
   3. Slow / no progress observed on Cross-CE. The VO that will be used has been created.

On the Horizon
   1. Need to improve info services e.g. for runtime SE discovery.
   2. Need to define the vision for dynamic resource provisioning / Cloud computing on OSG

Key Accomplishments
   1. HTCondor-CE: released yesterday.
   2. Improved coordination on gWMS work.
