---+++ New Items for [[https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=86][OSG Calendar]], 
---+++ Current plan for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/NewsletterArticles][Newsletter Articles]]
Please note that all newsletter articles are due around the middle of the month before the targeted newsletter.

**We want to get an update on the area goals we had established at the staff retreat; these goals are available at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1217

Also please remember that the next OSG annual report for each area will explicitly state the goals and the results.

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Tracking whether opportunistic pool is demand limited: yes in the past month. 50 M H opportunistically in the past 3 mo.
   2. Tracking opportunistic site: Syracuse still #1 w/ 14M h in 3 mo.
   3. SDSC Comet: running opportunistic slots for OSG VO at the level of 1,000 cores. Finalizing accounting to identify Comet cycles.
   4. Site integration: progress on FIU, JINR, University of Bern, Harvard

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. NOvA campaign for early 2016: job efficiency and data-movement limitations (addressed via StashCache)
   2. Some Fermilab experiments need &gt; 2GB/ core. Addressed via partitionable slots, but concern about CPU underutilization.
   3. Atlas and CMS on opportunistic cycles: only limite set of workflows can run this way.

Key Accomplishments
   1. LIGO computing is running on OSG at 5k slots concurrently.
   2. Evaluated Gratiaweb support of google plots on ITB. Need to decide whether to make it production.
   3. OSG VO runs multicore jobs on multiple sites e.g. 1k slots on MWT2
   4. Need to discuss support centers for LIGO and non-US sites.
