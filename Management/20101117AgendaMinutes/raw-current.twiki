---++ 1.0.1 Software Tools Group

We last reported to the Area Coordinators at the [[20100826AgendaMinutes][August 26th, 2010 meeting]].

We continue to have meetings on an as-needed basis. Given that a lot of the software that OSG owns is in a steady state right now, that means that we have not had frequent meetings. 

---+++ GUMS 

We were hoping to ship a new release of GUMS by the beginning of October. This would not only be the first release since Jay Packard left, but it would also be our first release where the VDT team built GUMS from source. To date, it hasn&#39;t happened because the GUMS team (Dave Stampf and John Hover) are working on stamping out the last couple of bugs. We have high hopes for a release &quot;soon&quot;, but given the regular delays, we are not predicting a release date. 

---+++ RSV

A new release of RSV is about to go into production. This includes new changes that make it much easier for system administrators to configure RSV. It also includes several long-delayed additions to set of RSV metrics, including Brian Bockelman&#39;s information services metrics, Parag Mhashilkar&#39;s RESS metrics, and Doug Strain&#39;s new Storage Element metrics. 

---+++ Pigeon Tools

There is a new software component from the OSG Storage Group at Fermilab to help a VO test a set of sites for access to storage elements. After some initial difficulties, these new &quot;Pigeon Tools&quot; are a thin layer on top of existing RSV metrics. We are pleased because we minimized the set of software that needed to be developed while still providing a tool that meets the needs of smaller VOs who need help accessing OSG sites. 

---+++ Bestman 2 from source

We are finally shipping Bestman 2 as built by the VDT from source code! Well, it&#39;s in final testing on the ITB, with the new release expected before Thanksgiving. 

---+++ PPDG Certificate Scripts

OSG site administrators rely on a set of tools called the _PPDG Certificate Scripts_ or _Cert Scripts_ for short. Doug Olson is the maintainer, but he&#39;s leaving the security team, so we will be meeting soon to determine what to do with these tools.

---++ 1.0.4 LIGO Applications - Kent Blackburn

---+++ Binary Inspiral Workflows

Currently working within a task force to extend the data used in these workflows to the scale appropriate for achieving science worthy analyses (transfers of 60000 data files is involved). This requires the use of SRM Storage Elements on the OSG with compatible interconnects to the worker nodes to make the Pegasus Workflow Planner a viable engine to construct the complex DAG structures in these analyses. To date, we have made good progress in populating 3 to 4 SEs with this scale of data. We are currently working on running the workflows on 3 of these production sites. One site has shown as a success. Two others are in progress, running now. Details can be found at websites maintained by Britta Daudert: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/OpportunisticStorageForLIGOBInspiral][Opportunistic Storage]], [[http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~bdaudert/INSPIRAL/S6-IHOPE-RUNS/RUNS/][Workflow Runs]], and [[http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~bdaudert/INSPIRAL/][Binary Inspiral Project]]. 

Also working to use Glidein technology to run these workflows, still using Pegasus to generate the complex workflow DAGs

---+++ Einstein at Home on the OSG 

Continue to run successfully in [[http://osg-job.ligo.caltech.edu/qoop/html/statistics.html][production]] at a large number of sites (34 sites at this time). Typically see 3000 to 7000 concurrent E@OSG jobs running on the OSG. In the past week Gratia reports averages of 60K cpu-hours per day, a maximum of 143K cpu-hours in one very good day. In the past week the average number of Einstein@Home science [[http://boincstats.com/stats/boinc_user_graph.php?pr=bo&amp;id=6e5b0d2679ae1e414a6b04661eb1bb4f][credits]] per day has been 1 million. Bottom line comment is that the number of opportunistic cycles continues to be well below the all time highs seen this year, but recent numbers are better than seen at various eras in the recent past.

---+++ LIGO Pegasus Collaboration

The Pegasus developers have been working closely with LIGO to enhance Pegasus to support running on the OSG using SEs. They will be releasing Pegasus 3.0 very soon with some enhancements towards this. We already have a beta version for testing (as of today). There are plans to add second level staging in the time frame of next spring which should make it possible to run on many more SEs with a different topology connecting them to the worker nodes that our workflows are currently constrained by.
