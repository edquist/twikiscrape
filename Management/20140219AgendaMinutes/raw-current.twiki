---++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. OSG Modular dashboard - original dashboard orphaned - working on replacement prototype (see concerns)
   2. Improvements in perfSONAR-PS (security and bugs) - deployed in WLCG OSG sites - starting now push to install at all OSG sites
   3. Documentation and outreach

Top Issues / Concerns
   1.  Orphaned Modular dashboard - Replacement prototype based on ESNet MaDDash (visualization) and Open Monitoring Distribution (monitoring / tests) - need to define deployment plan for production in OSG - datastore function is still missing
   2. Automated generation of perfSONAR mesh-configs - need to evaluate if this can be done from OIM as initially planned
   3. Breadth of perfSONAR deployment, beyond WLCG sites

Key Accomplishments
   1. Prototype of new Modular Dashboard
   2. Release and deployment of perfSONAR 3.3.2 - improved robustness and bug fixes
   3. LHCONE/LHCOPN , WLCG, GDB communities expressed interested in accessing the network metrics
