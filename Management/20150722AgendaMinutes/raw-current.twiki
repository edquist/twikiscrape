Key Initiatives
   1. Atlas runs opportunistically at 11 sites; for now testing levels (200k h in 2 mo). Working with CMS now; targeting heavy ion jobs for opportunistic.
   2. OSG-HPC-CE to connect to SDSC Comet. Work to start in August.
   3. Multicore / GPU: need to quantify opportunistic multicore slots and test GPU further with SBGrid
   4. Gratiaweb improvements - propose to change static charts with google charts - estimated 3 mo FTE

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Site integrations / upgrades are slow. Now working with FIU, Harvard, SMU, Georgia Tech. Facing issues with firewall rules: propose to maintain a central list of rules.

Key Accomplishments
   1. 24.8 M wall hours in the past 2 mo (13% of total OSG)
   2. mu2e exceeded baseline goals - 14.5 M wall hours since March; 11.2 M opportunistic
   3. NOvA completed 15M h campaign in 6 mo with dedicated OSG resources. Planning for next campaign 2-3x larger.
