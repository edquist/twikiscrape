Updates:

* The membership of the INCIDENT-REPORT-L and INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L mailing

lists is now restricted to the incident response team, not all grid

security contacts, to minimize disclosure of sensitive incident data and

make the lists more manageable and useful for the incident response

team. The GOC provides a separate facility for communicating with grid

security contacts.

to [[mailto:security@opensciencegrid.org][security@opensciencegrid.org]].
