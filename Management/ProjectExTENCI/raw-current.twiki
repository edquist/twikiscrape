---++ Introduction
The Extending Science Through Enhanced National !CyberInfrastructure ([[http://tinyurl.com/NSF-ExTENCI][ExTENCI]]) Project is a joint OSG and !TeraGrid project, funded by the NSF OCI, with the goal to: *Develop and provide production quality enhancements to the National !CyberInfrastructure that will enable specific science applications to more easily use both OSG and !TeraGrid  or broaden access to a capability to both !TeraGrid and OSG users.  This needs to be shown by having a science project make production use of the new capability and/or by measuring the performance improvement or throughput of science application.*  The project runs from August, 2010 through July, 2012.

The project PIs are Paul Avery (University of Florida), Ralph Roskies (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center), and Dan Katz (University of Chicago).  The project is organized around four technology components that are designed to provide new capabilities for specific science applications to run on either !TeraGrid or OSG.

---++ Expectations
The technologies resulting from the !ExTENCI project are expected to provide science users the ability to more easily and effectively access and use resources in OSG and !TeraGrid.

---++ Technology Components
The technology components, supported science, and responsible leader are listed in the following table.
| *Technology* | *Science(s)* | *Leader(s)* |
| Distributed File System (Lustre-WAN) | CMS/ATLAS HEP | Ralph Roskies |
| Virtual Machines | STAR &amp; CMS | Carol Song / Sebastian Goasguen |
| Workflow &amp; Client Tools | SCEC &amp; Protein Folding | Mike Wilde |
| Job Submission Paradigms | Cactus Application | Shantenu Jha / Miron Livny |
