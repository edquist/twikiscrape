  - Rob had good discussions in Wisconsin, Fermilab, Facility meeting prior to this.  reviewed and signed off. 

Review proposed Operations ticket metrics:

These metrics are only a beginning. They are a part of the assessment measurements  for
   * Effectiveness of Project Management - timely response  to user/administrator/other  issues. 
   * Insight and understanding -- need to look in more depth at the types of problems and categorize them by whether they could have been avoided with better code, utilities, documentation... 
   * Customer Satisfaction - Will be useful to have a classification that gives a measure of impact of the problem reported - is the reporter prevented from doing their work until it is resolved.etc. 

[[http://www.grid.iu.edu/reports/ticketreports.html][Metric Reports]]

To determine the level of criticality in any problem report the Operations Center does an initial determination of the criticality: [[%ATTACHURL%/priority.doc][priority]]
. For Security issues is given this by the Security Officer.

NOTES:
GOC closes a ticket but always asks the user if they agree and says they will reopen it if asked. If reopened will be the same ticket. Will check the open times. Can this mail have a clickable response of the user for rating. 
Rob will ask about scaling the Y axis to the maximum value being displayed.
Can one chart the number of transactions or times the ticket was touched for each ticket. Gives a measure of the level of effort. 
What are the category of the metrics: Not Control Metrics.  Observed metrics.
