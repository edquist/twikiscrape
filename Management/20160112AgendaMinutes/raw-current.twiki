   1. OSG CA Transition
      1. The detailed information about the transition timetables, steps to take, etc go to https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CATransitionProcedure     
      2. We have transitioned Atlas on Dec 7th and CMS on January 12. So far so good for both transitions. Both VOs direct their users to CERN CA. They only use OSG CA for host certs. 
      3. We are preparing Fermilab hosted VOs, Dune, and CDF for transition on Jan 26th.
      4. A new VO client package released for the Fermilab hosted VOs due to change in VOMS server certificate. 
      5. Overall we have no big issues or complaints from the VOs. We had some issues discovered during the transition, but we were able to respond quickly and effectively.  
      6. What we learned so far
         1. We discovered several issues over the course of the transition period all of them except for one (I will talk about it below) have been resolved. 
         2. Before we started any of the transition, we discovered that we have a problem with SAN-enabled certs. OSG-code (command line) did not support SAN certs. In the past, we issued such certs by going directly to DigiCert platform. We also learned that CILogon HSM did not have this capability either. CILogon HSM and OSG teams immediately fixed the issue and released a new command line tool January 15th. We planned that we could issue certs directly from DigiCet for any VO until the command line is released. 
         3. We discovered that the version of the CSR file we generate from the command line tools fail at CIlogon HSM backend. We did not have this failure during our testing period. Basney claims we should have failed back then since they did not change server code, but we checked and re-checked our test results and there was no failure. OSG Software team made an emergency release that fixes the issue. Atlas initially negatively impacted by this problem. But, given they had only 5 Atlas members with expiring host certs, the interruption was very small. The new command line client fixed the issue and Atlas reported no further problems. 
         4. We initially discovered that in order to switch a VO in OIM to CIlogon OSG CA, OIM needs to make a software release. This made our scheduling more complicated as we originally thought the switch would be a configuration change. OIM team agreed to make a out-of-schedule OIM release to transition Atlas. And, we fixed all our upcoming transition dates to match OSG Software team and Operations teams schedules. Later Kyle from OIM team confirmed that our original assumption was correct and switching a VO in OIM is only a configuration change and we should not ask for OIM software releases in future. 
         5. We had a coordination issue with releasing new OSG VO Client packages. In the end, we understood taht OSG Software team, Operations and security team should regularly meet before we transition a VO to make sure all release dates are met. 
         6. We discovered that upgrading the vo-client package has some unforeseen consequences. When we change a VOMS server certificate to CILogon OSG CA, we need a new vo client package. If a user does not get the new package, what we expect to happen is the users request against the upgraded VOMS server will fail over to another VOMS server, which is not upgraded yet. We never upgrade all VOMS servers certs at the same time. What we found out is that voms-proxy-init does not fail when a user lacks the new vo-client package. The user gets a valid voms proxy, but the voms-proxy exit code would not be 0. So, the user cannot fail over to the un-upgraded VOMS server. We discovered this problem while transitioning the Fermilab hosted VOs. One solution is to shut-down the upgraded VOMS server so everyone can fail over to old VOMS server until everyone updates the vo-client pakcage. 
   2. OSG Operations.
      1. One of the problems was DigiCert intermediate CA&#39;s transition to SHA-2. A new intermediate CA is cretaed by DigiCert, whose cert is signed by using the SHA-2. Our users are now getting their certs signed by this new CA. A user&#39;s certificate DN is not changed. So, when they do a voms-proxy-init , they should get voms-proxies. However, we realized that because the CA issuer for the user changed, they cannot get a voms-proxy. Initially we did not notice the problem because when we tested against the CERN CMS, we had no issues. Later we understood that this is an issue if you do not enable the skip_ca_check flag in VOMS. This flag is enabled in VOMS 2.0.12-2, and OSG currently distributes VOMS 2.0.12-3. The other part of the problem was the VOMS-Admin tool. Normally an existing user should not need to use voms-admin except for re-signing the AUP. in VOMS-Admin 3.3.2 has the skip_ca_check flag available, but we are on VOMS Admin 2.7.0. Brian is looking into fixing this.
      2. Asked IGTF to remove the old DigiCert which has the wrong DN.  
      3. One critical vulnerability announcement about NSS vulnerability.   
   3. Security Blueprint 
      1. Thinking about hosting all VOMS server centrally at GOC. 
      2. Thinking about dropping VOMS-Admin from our software stack. 
   4. DCAFI- Integrating IF VOs with CIlogon Basic
      1. 50% of the software development is finished. We now have a CIGetCert client tool, similar to LIGO Client tool for CIlogon Basic CA. 
      2. Moving along fine. 
      3. Our paper to a computer science security conf CISR 2016 epxlaining our work in this area got accepted. Working on the camera ready version. 
   5. HEPCloud Security Review. 
      1. Reviewing the architecture and writing the risk assessment and the security plan.

Key Initiatives
   1. OSG CA Transition: CMS and Atlas have transitioned successfully using CERN for user certs and OSG for hosts. Transition for Fermilab, Dune, and CDF VOs is on Jan 26. Change requires upgrade of VO client package at client nodes.
   2. DCAFI / Trash/Trash/Integration of IF VOs with CILogon CA. Software development: 50% done. Paper on this to CISR16 accepted. On track with deadlines, but still no commitment on MyProxy operations.
   3. HEPCloud Security Review started. Preparing security documentation.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. DigiCert has transitioned to SHA-2 and releases certificates with a new issuer DN. This is problematic when interacting with some versions / configurations of VOMS and VOMS-Admin. Developing a solution.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Held Security Blueprint: considering to host all VOMS servers at GOC and drop VOMS-Admin from the software stack. The latter would be problematic for the Fermilab VO.
