---+++ Software - Tim Cartwright

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * *Big Projects*
      * Non-root clients for OSG 3.x
      * Migration from Orace JDK 6 to (probably) Open JDK 7
      * &amp;ldquo;Upcoming&amp;rdquo; software repository

   * *New Software (or Major Updates)*
      * Frontier Squid (specific squid version + configuration)
      * CVMFS configuration for OASIS
      * SLURM support (another batch system)
      * HTCondor-CE

   * *Ongoing Updates and Support*
      * Software: CA certificates, Fetch CRL v3 on el5, !GridFTP, HDFS (0.20), VOMS (2.0.x), &amp;hellip;
      * Sites: Oklahoma (LSF), RENCI-Blueridge, &amp;hellip;
      * Tickets (GOC and JIRA)

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Effort*
      * Doug Strain (50%) is leaving on 15 February for Google in Mountain View, CA
      * Carl Edquist will join Madison team on 4 February
      * Hope to add a second Madison team member later in February
      * Donated effort from Technology, still working out details
      * Tim must run 2013 OSG User School

   * *Multiple High-Priority Projects*
      * Java, client, upcoming, !HTCondor-CE, SLURM, SHA-2
      * Added effort will help, but see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month The Mythical Man-Month]]
      * Working closely with Technology, Production, and Project Management areas
      * Outlook: Cautiously optimistic!

   * *Slowed or Delayed Projects*
      * Documentation: Affects end-user experience &amp;mdash; chipping away at most important tasks
      * Testing: Affects end-user experience &amp;mdash; making small progress, esp. on infrastructure
      * Configuration management: Affects end-user experience &amp;mdash; not started
      * Debian support: Affects who can use OSG Software &amp;mdash; not started
      * Community packaging, especially w.r.t. EPEL: Affects effort &amp;mdash; not started (but, e.g., Java)

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

   * *&gt; 60% Deployment of OSG Software 3 (RPMs)*
      * As of 29 January 2013: 63 sites using OSG 3, 39 sites using OSG 1.2
      * OSG 1.2 deprecation notice sent to sites, more coming soon

   * *Releases*
      * Since last Software report (7 November 2012):
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3112][3.1.12]]: CA certs, GRAM jobmanager, !GlideinWMS, bug fixes
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3113][3.1.13]]: %RED%BeStMan 2%ENDCOLOR%, !jGlobus, GUMS, Pakiti, !XRootD, !UberFTP, &amp;hellip;
      * Aiming for about one per month, but will do interim releases (e.g., 3.1.14) as appropriate

   * *SHA-2 Support*
      * Pre-implementation testing essentially complete
      * !BeStMan 2 has shipped
      * Need to update VOMS client to pick up non-critical bug fix
      * Expect issues to show up once SHA-2 certificates start coming out

---+++ Minutes
Present: Mine, Brian, Tim, Rob, Chander, Gabriele, Dan
Key Initiatives
   1 Schedule-driven Big projects - Java, SHA-2, OASIS / CVMFS - Currently OK - Need to handle carefully complex dependencies (transition to Java v7, ...)
   2 Internally-driven Big projects - SLURM, HTCondor-CE - Proceeding, but experiencing delays due to effort limitations
   3 Ongoing Update / Support - Proceeding well: site deployments and stakeholders expectations

Top Issues / Concerns
   1 Effort - continues as a major concern - Gaining 1 FTE now, losing 0.5FTE mid Feb, gaining 1 FTE late Feb
   2 Multiple High-Priority Projects - Java, SHA-2, SLURM, ... - flexibility of only a few weeks in the schedule - managing priorities closely
   3 Some projects slowed / delayed - tracking expectations of stakeholders - no known major impacts soon

Key Accomplishments
   1 &gt; 60% deployment of rpm: proceeding as expected
   2 1 release per month as planned
   3 SHA-2 Support - verified - more testing is coming - Sep 1 is official turn over date
