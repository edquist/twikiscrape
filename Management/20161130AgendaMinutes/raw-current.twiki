---++ Tim Cartwright - Software

Since 21 September 2016.

---+++ Software updates
November and December releases:
   * Ended support for Globus GRAM
   * Fixed a Globus !GridFTP hang
   * Fixed a couple of small Gratia accounting issues
   * Updated HTCondor-CE to report information for ATLAS AGIS
   * Other small updates and enhancements to HTCondor-CE and BLAHP
   * Improved EL&amp;nbsp;7 support by adding or improving =systemd= integration for several components
   * Updated OSG PKI tools to use SHA2 for Certificate Signing Requests
   * Disabled SSLv3 for several Globus tools
   * Updated !EDG-MkGridMap, !GlideinWMS

---+++ SELinux
After further investigation, only HTCondor needs SELinux work. Tim Theisen is working on it.

---+++ Support
The Software team typically handles 3&amp;ndash;4 active site support issues every week, in additional to other random GOC tickets that come our way. Since the last report, we have helped:
   * Caltech - Found CE jobs being throttled due to local legacy script that removed non-CMS jobs
   * Cancer Computer - Up and running; fixed BLAHP bug
   * CHTC - Fixing malformed accounting records
   * Harvard - Fixed GIP/slurmdb issues that brought down their Slurm backend
   * IIT - Up and running, adding new EL6/EL7 mixed clusters
   * Notre Dame - Found and fixed empty-condor/HTCondor-CE incompatibility
   * PDSF - Working on installing a CE on a netbooted image
   * RAL - Discovered multiple condor_q-related bugs
   * UFL - Fixed BLAHP/Torque incompatibility
   * Utah - Up and running, adding new EL6/EL7 mixed clusters

---+++ Concerns
Just one: We are waiting on other groups for a number of WBS items (see below).

---++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. SELinux: HTCondor is the only component that requires work: assigned to Tim T. OSG will not ship SELinux-specific rules: depending on HTCondor for that, expected in Dec.
   2. Continue support for sites at ~3 issues per week. Relevant examples: (1) Cancer Computing is now contributing cycles to OSG. (2) Clarified accounting of jobs for CHTC.
   3. Started to plan for OSG v3.4 release for Jun 17. Adding support for Singularity containers in Dec 2016.
   4. 3 releases since Sep 21; no special releases. Now testing HTCondor pre-releases on OSG ITB at Madison; found one defect for the HTCondor team.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Several work items are waiting on other groups for progress. Managing timelines accordingly.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Ended support for Globus GRAM. No negative comments.
   2. Updated HTCondor-CE to report to ATLAS AGIS: last remaining stumbling block for BDII retirement.
