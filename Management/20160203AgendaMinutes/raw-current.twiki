---+++ New Items for [[https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=86][OSG Calendar]], 
---+++ Current plan for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/NewsletterArticles][Newsletter Articles]]
Please note that all newsletter articles are due around the middle of the month before the targeted newsletter.

**We want to get an update on the area goals we had established at the staff retreat; these goals are available at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1217

Also please remember that the next OSG annual report for each area will explicitly state the goals and the results.

Key Initiatives
   1. 3 out of the top 5 VOs primarily ran opportunistically for 200M CPU h last year. Last quarter opportunistic: 60M CPU h from 50M.
   2. Questions from council: Is increased OSG production in 2015 due to LHC Run 2? In part, but others VOs were not penalized; also thanks to increased university (non-LHC) site participation (Syracuse, Clemson, Washington).
   3. 1.2M hours used by OSG VO since November on Comet. Next step is allowing allocation-based access via OSG infrastructure
   4. Community Engagement - IceCube: running on OSG; now targeting EU resources. Harvard Medical School - Interest in using OSG as a standard computing toolkit; trip to Boston to discuss.
 

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Next NOvA production campaign scheduled for next week - working closely with the VO to position OSG opportunistic to contribute to the crunch. Shortcoming is about 1M CPU h per month in Mar / Apr.


Key Accomplishments
   1. Site integration: JINR site for NOvA and University of Bern for Microboone
   2. LIGO end-of-year campaign: 4.5M CPU hours (mostly opportunistic)
   3. DES Gravity Wave - Optical followup of LIGO signal with DES data: demonstrated feasibility on OSG running 700 jobs opportunistically in 24 h and the rest (60%) on dedicated resources.
