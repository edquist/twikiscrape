---++ Software - Tim Cartwright

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 22 January 2014:

   * Finished integrating Globus Toolkit (5.2.5) from EPEL
   * Finished integrating OSG Info Services, the OSG 3.2 replacement for CE-Monitor
   * Solved remaining known issues with HTCondor CE support for PBS
   * Completed basic disaster recovery tasks for OSG Software infrastructure at UW–Madison
   * Contributed to releases: [[Documentation.Release3.Release3130][3.1.30]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3131][3.1.31]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3132][3.1.32]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release324][3.2.4]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release325][3.2.5]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release326][3.2.6]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release327][3.2.7]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release328][3.2.8]]
      * Integrated a fix for a crasher in the Globus job manager
      * Upgraded to !XRootD 3.3.5 then 3.3.6
      * Upgraded to a significantly new version of the Gratia probes
      * Upgraded to CVMFS 2.1.17
      * Many bug fixes and minor improvements to RSV and osg-configure
      * Routine certificate and VO package updates

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * WBS 1.x: Ongoing
   * [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][WBS 2.1: Transition from Oracle Java 6 to !OpenJDK 7]] &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;
   * WBS 2.2: Add support for SLURM resource management system &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;
   * [[SoftwareTeam.SP021_NewVersions][WBS 2.3: Prepare for OSG 3.2 and beyond (aka “OSG Next”)]] &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;
   * WBS 2.4: Merge in latest Globus Toolkit changes (but not including upstreamed patches) &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;
   * WBS 5.2: Run tests as normal jobs locally and perhaps in OSG &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;

   * WBS 3.1: Unify HTCondor RPMs &amp;mdash; transitioned to HTCondor/Release team, waiting on official release

   * WBS 3.2: Take over Debian support &amp;mdash; transitioned to HTCondor/Release team

   * WBS 3.3: Release HTCondor CE &amp;mdash; HTCondor and PBS support complete, planning a 1.0 release for May 2014

   * WBS 4.1: Move Globus patches upstream &amp;mdash; waiting on Globus developers

   * WBS 4.3: Join EPEL and donate some packages &amp;mdash; in progress (Mat)

   * WBS 5.1: Simplify test development by improving test framework
      * Delayed due to focus on VMU testing and new tests (e.g., !MyProxy, HTCondor CE)
      * Goal is to support rerunning certain tests under different configurations (e.g., “manually”, via osg-configure, via puppet)
      * High-level plan is to enable this kind of testing with a new test sequencing algorithm using DAGs

   * WBS 6.1: 2013 OSG User School &amp;mdash; nearly complete, need to close out finances at UW–Madison
   * WBS 6.2: 2014 OSG User School &amp;mdash; in progress, reviewing 32 applications (down from 45 last year)

   * Not on WBS (yet)
      * Help !perfSONAR developers with builds in OSG Koji (Madison), packaging, etc. &amp;mdash; in progress
      * Help build a Madison ITB site &amp;mdash; delayed start, then restarted hardware plans a few times
      * OSG site configuration &amp;mdash; support contributed Puppet modules (short-term), publish “official” Puppet modules (medium-term, ~ 6 months out?)
      * Evaluate OSG software stack for !IPv6 readiness &amp;mdash; evaluation by end of summer, work on non-compliant software thereafter
      * Publish policy for OSG software release series &amp;mdash; was done, but then Miron asked for a rewrite
      * Make frontier-squid mandatory on a CE &amp;mdash; in progress but stalled
      * Look into supporting EL 7 &amp;mdash; on the horizon
      * Design and implement a new OSG client package &amp;mdash; on the horizon
      * Divide Gratia probe packaging to ease management and avoid future release bottlenecks &amp;mdash; discussed, need to reach consensus

---+++ Top Concerns

   * Starting to accumulate a fair number of medium-to-largish tasks &amp;mdash; faster than we can complete them.

   * The backlog of useful work is still significant. We will find a better way to track, understand, and manage this backlog.

   * There has been little to no effort put into documentation lately. We are shifting the responsibility for this area back to Software and will draft a plan to address missing, incomplete, and out-of-date documents.

---+++ Stakeholder Requests

   * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/REQUESTS-62][REQ-62]]: Add extra features to GUMS (support for groups)
      * Really an OSG Software item?
      * I thought that this is still an ET/Technology item
