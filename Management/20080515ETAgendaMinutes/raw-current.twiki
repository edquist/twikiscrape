Come to agreement and gather the stakeholder needs
and schedule, plan the response to the concerns raised at
February&#39;s review, and define the next years program of work to the
time-line Chander showed in last weeks Finance Board.

Towards this it is really important that we know if you cannot
attend any meeting so I can arrange to follow up with you
afterwards, and that you do if possible attend for the discussions.

A reminder of the first item on Chander&#39;s schedule: Document Key
Project Drivers, Goals &amp; Plans of the experiments, OSG
Strategic/Year 3 Roadmap, Feedback from DOE/NSF review   June 15

At the Finance Board meeting I was charged to present a list of the  key project drivers  for Year 3. Below is my first pass of  6
items for this:

/*Key Project Drivers:*/&lt;br&gt;
Meet goals and schedule of WLCG, ATLAS, CMS.&lt;br&gt;
Meet goals and schedule for LIGO.&lt;br&gt;
Meet goals and schedule of other stakeholders&lt;br&gt;
Improve the ease of installation/configuration of the OSG software.&lt;br&gt;
Improve the efficiency to become fully participating members of OSG.&lt;br&gt;
Provide means to measure the scaling and performance envelopes of
the infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;

I also have some draft ideas in response to the review. I will be
following up with the JOT on the high level concerns we have
extracted from the reviewer comments I was sent, as well as working
with Chander and Brian to revise the Year 2 Metrics document to
include measurement of the US ATLAS, US CMS, WLCG and LIGO goals
and then pass these by you and the JOT.

/*Actions in response to the review:*/

1. OSG Requirements driven by LHC/LIGO requirements; demonstrate
linkage:

Add columns to Work Items showing specific linaage of tasks to
major stakeholders.

2. Metrics that inform of the progress of OSG and contributions to
science, especially LHC /ASCR etc.

Add metrics specifically for the LHC and LIGO
Add metrics specifically for ASCR

3. Scalability of operations model

Measure trends in effort and timelines for 3 operations tasks:
Ability of new site to install and accept OSG jobs, report to the
accounting and run the RSV tests; Ability of new VO to register and
then run grid-capable application on OSG; Trash/Deployment of new
security patch;

4. Ever increasing scope of software stack

Institute gate keeper process for including sotfware and planning
for releases.

5. How to manage/prioritize ever increasing demands

Institute action item registers, ensure good attendance to
Executive Team meetings such that decisions can be taken with
everyone needed present.

6. Increase tracking of Impact on research

Have better contact to local communications organizations/people at
OSG member sites and improve/increase contact with them to get
local activity in gathering information on the impact on research.
