---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. perfSONAR-PS imporvements : ~80% deployments to new version (3.4.2) out of 233
   2. OSG modular dashboard - progress toward production: defining hardware necessary; addressing faults resulting from new validation procedures; solidifying infrastructure
   3. Outreach

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Target transition of Datastore to production by July. Issues: MaDDash display needs code fix to properly show data from the datastore. Esmon: discrepancies between remote and datastore data; high-load of hosting machines under investigation; not yet defined the data migration process to the production instance. Need to monitor closely feature additions for instabilities e.g. integration with CERN message bus.
   2. 41 perfSONAR instances with multiple issues: some upgraded instances need reinstall; some instances with too low memory; some do not expose all needed info. Following up with individual sites.
   3. No easy way to configure meshes for non WLCG sites. Need to develop tools.

Key Accomplishments
   1. New effort from WLCG for perfSONAR incidents (0.5 FTE x 6 mo for ATLAS)
   2. Implemented new metrics on data freshness
