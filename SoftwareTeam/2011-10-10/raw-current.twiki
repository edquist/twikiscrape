---+ OSG Software Team Meeting, 10-Oct-2011

This meet was canceled due to the [[Documentation/DocumentationTeam.RPMDocFest][Doc Fest]], but we have a collection of status reports from people. 

   * *Igor:* Has been testing OSG Client installation. 
   * *Tim:* Has been working on Debian 6 package for LIGO. 
   * *Jeff:* * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-277][Patched hadoop-0.20]] to account for the issue reported that a required library file was not found due to not following symlinks when using java with alternatives. Commented on the [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-278][discussion on the correct hadoop user, &quot;hadoop&quot; vs &quot;hdfs&quot;]]  [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-240][Still finishing up gridftp-hdfs rpm]], it should be ready early this week.
   * *Scot*:  released a new version of RSV with Marco&#39;s CA Certificate validity probe, made a few other RSV changes based on feedback and did some RPM testing, and brain dumped RSV knowledge to Mat so that he can maintain it in my upcoming absence if necessary.
   * *Alex*:  Follow-ups on OSG assessment review for bestman: bestman2 dependency updates, source release wrap-up (dropping unnecessary lib dependencies and modules (e.g. GUMS-SAML), and re-organizing sources). New library updates break httpg. We&#39;re not sure what causes where.
