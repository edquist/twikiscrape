%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| October | 3.2.28 / 3.3.2 | 2015-09-28 | 2015-10-05 | 2015-10-13 | 5 week cycle |
| November | 3.2.29 / 3.3.3 | 2015-10-26 | 2015-11-02 | 2015-11-10 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

*GRAM/PBS.* Last week, we started getting involved with an issue at University of Washington Seattle and their Hyak cluster. It seems that GRAM stops reporting on status of PBS jobs, causing the factory to stop sending new pilots. Jeff Dost was very involved in this ticket earlier, and got Hyak to switch to HTCondor-CE, which seems to be working great now. Jeff clarified that he can see this issue in factory monitoring very clearly, and it seems to go back as far as there are records, so it is unlikely to be (completely) due to any recent GRAM changes. The question has come up whether we can automatically detect and report on this issue; Jeff believes that he can describe the signature of the issue well enough that we could create a tool to watch for it. Also, Jeff will look through [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1929][SW-1929]] to see if there are any similarities. But given the scant support for GRAM at this time, it may be best to monitor for the issue and ask sites to move to HTCondor-CE.

*Documentation.* There is a new OSG documentation project starting, run by the GOC (Elizabeth and Kyle). They seem to be moving in a good direction, wanting to separate internal-only from external-facing documentation, remove old and unused documents, and have a clear, searchable site that is based on user needs. !TimC will be involved in planning and direction, so you can bring questions and concerns to him. The timescale is fairly broad, so no rush.

---+++ Major Activities

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * OASIS:
      * (old) New version goes out to ITB tomorrow (primary feature: ability to replicate any repository and still follow OSG-Security constraints).  Assuming successful production deploy, we will need to do a new client config RPM in November.
   * StashCache:
      * StashCache tester continues to gather good performance data at https://stashcache.github.io/
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.  CVMFS team is reviewing the pull requests.  All parts are now functional.
      * Making progress in puppetizing GOC configuration.  DNS alias still giving problems with XRootD rediretor.
   * CEMon (part of HTCondor-CE): 
      * Got first round of requests for improvements from AGIS.  Ball is in our court now, on going.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report
