---+!! Installing an OSG Build Box

This page contains instructions for setting up an EL6 or EL7 host for use as a
build machine.

---++ Installing OSG and EPEL repos
Like with any OSG software, the OSG and EPEL repos (preferably the latest) must
be installed.  See [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories]] for instructions.

---++ Installing the osg-build tool

The primary development tool for packages is called osg-build, and is
documented at [[SoftwareTeam.OSGBuildTools]].  It is a wrapper for tools like
rpmbuild, mock, and koji.  It is available in the regular OSG repositories, and
can be installed by running:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-build
&lt;/pre&gt;

The latest version is also available on !GitHub at
[[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build]].
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the software prerequisites are installed, osg-build can be run directly from
the Git clone.

---++ Checking out the package source from subversion
Current work is done in subversion.  The command to check out the subversion is:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% svn co https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/native/redhat
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Using Koji
See [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/KojiWorkflow#Using_Koji][the Using Koji section of the Koji Workflow page]].

---++ Setting up Mock (optional)
Mock allows you to build packages on your local machine in a clean chroot
environment. It allows you to replicate the Koji build environment on your
local machine.

For security reasons, in order to use mock, your user must be in the =mock=
Unix group.  To add your user to the mock group, edit =/etc/group=, add your
%RED%username%ENDCOLOR% (as returned by =id=) to the mock line:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
mock:x:109:%RED%username%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Performance Suggestions (optional)
It is suggested that mock builds are done in ram, if you have enough -- 4GB or more.
Mock build are all conducted under =/var/lib/mock/=.
Mounting that directory in a tmpfs file system will cause builds to be much faster.

An example mount command for creating a 3GB &#39;tmpfs&#39; filesystem in =/var/lib/mock=:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mount -t tmpfs -o size=3072m tmpfs /var/lib/mock
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Enabling OSG-Development Repo by default (optional)
Edit =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-development.repo= or =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6-development.repo=, changing enabled to %RED%1%ENDCOLOR%.
