---+ OSG Software Component: HTCondor-CE featuring blahp

---++ Purpose

HTCondor-CE is a gatekeeper, like Globus&#39; gatekeeper, that acts as a site&#39;s entrace to their computational cluster. Users can submit grid jobs to an HTCondor-CE and it transforms them via the HTCondor job router into jobs that can be submitted to HTCondor, PBS/SLURM, LSF and SGE backends that a site may utilize.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

Source: [[https://github.com/bbockelm/condor-ce]]

HTCondor-CE uses the blahp heavily to submit jobs to non-HTCondor backends and its upstream can be found at https://github.com/prelz/BLAH. The HTCondor team should be made aware of any changes to the blahp since they package it in their externals. Derek Weitzel manages the OSG version of the blahp (https://github.com/osg-bosco/BLAH), which is a fork of an updated version of the Italian grid&#39;s with HTCondor&#39;s patches applied and some additional python scripts that HTCondor-CE uses.

---++ Packaging

Since the OSG owns HTCondor-CE, the spec file is updated often in the source (config/htcondor-ce.spec). The tarball can be generated with:

&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% git archive --prefix=%{name}-%{version}/ v%{version} | gzip &gt; %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;
