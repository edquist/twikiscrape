---++ Notes

*Gratia probes and service* There are updates to the Gratia probes and service. Minor HTCondor probe bug fixes for the January release. Campus-grid changes added; would be nice if Suchandra can test. Added a new SLURM probe, which needs testing, but it might need to be backed out for the upcoming release; Tanya will talk to Brian/Nebraska folks to see if they need SLURM in production, otherwise we might want to keep the SLURM out of the release. Minor fixes to service, not ready for release this time.

*Documentation* For changes to !TWiki documents that should not be user-visible, the doc Foo should be copied to a name Foo_draft, with information about which version it was copied from. Should be merged back once its released. All of this is documented in the documentation documentation (yes, really); see above for a link.

*JIRA Workflow* New “OSG” workflow. “Resolved” and “Reopened” go away, and “Ready for testing” and “Ready for release” are added. In the switchover, existing tickets in the “reopened” state will go into the “opened” state, and “resolved” will go to “ready for testing” and Tim will look through those. If there are no objections to a follow-up email, Tim will do this change this week.

*Date for next release:* January 29 seems like the best bet.

*osg-configure:* Suchandra enhanced osg-configure to list enabled services. This change was requested independently, plus it will support a script that Tony Tiradani is working on that is a vdt-control analogue. This will need a lot of ITB testing – if ITB is too overloaded, they might not be able to test it in time for the release.
