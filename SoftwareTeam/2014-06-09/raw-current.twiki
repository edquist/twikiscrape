*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * GUMS work wrapping up.  Waiting on FNAL for making relevant dCache patches and do testing.
      * No patches for LCMAPS are needed from OSG (NIKHEF agreed to do them).  Have not yet investigated bestman2.
      * Mine is working with WLCG to hammer out the details of allowing sites to use WLCG banning (without involving OSG Ops).
   * Jose has been working closely with Ops to get a development version of OASIS2 working there.
   * HTCondor-CE rollout work continues.  Minor updates to documentation based on issues from Jose; said issues are not 100% understood yet.

   * !IPv6 evaluation: define project (!TimC et al.)
   * GUMS 1.4: promote latest build (Carl)
   * HTCondor CE: testing and improving with SGE and LSF (!BrianL, Marian)
   * Improve OSG PKI tool interfaces: coding (!BrianL)
   * Move OSG software source code (not packaging) to git(hub): get proposal reviewed (Mat)
   * HTCondor CE and PBS: waiting for Terrence to add a parallel PBS pool at UCSD (Edgar)
   * UW ITB site (Mat, !TimC)
      * Keep experimenting with Puppet

   * EL7 support

---+++ Notes

*HTCondor CE:* Jose noticed that things with his CE install got better when he removed the i386 binaries. !BrianB doubted that the i386 binaries themselves were the root of the problem, but !BrianB and Jose will discuss offline.
