---++ Notes

OSG Production is considering an end-of-life date for OSG 1.2 and hence our use of Pacman. This date could be as early as mid-Spring, 2013.

Doug will be doing the release, his first. This release has several high-visibility components, and we are getting positive feedback from people in production in general. Thanks to everyone that had to deal with urgent testing, debugging, and fixing for this release. Tim will strive to avoid last-minute issues with future releases.

The decision resulting from last week’s !jPackage failure is that we will make a single, manual archive of the current !jPackage repositories. We will do so at a “known good” time, to avoid corruption. Further archiving is probably unnecessary or at least rare, given that the last update to !jPackage occurred in 2009. We will not build our packages against our archive, but rather keep it safe in case something catastrophic happens to !jPackage.
