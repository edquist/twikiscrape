%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
None this week.

---+++ Support Update
   * CHTC (!BrianL) - Dan Bradley installed the new gratia-probe package to great success. Still waiting on IceCube to update their submit hosts
   * IIT (Marty/BrianL) - Still investigating jobs landing on the incorrect OS. CE1 appears to be ok and we&#39;re testing CE2.
   * Utah (Derek) - Rogue files in /tmp are causing nodes to fill up and die. Filenames like: pdbqt2mol2_aQ8DyMiL and icerec.releases.IC2014-L2_V14-02-00.r120265.Linux-x86_64.gcc-4.4.7.  I suspect the second is !IceCube.

HTCondor post-install scripts can fail on EL7 if policycoreutils-python is not installed. Trivial fix, but it&#39;s past all the freeze dates. Will need to talk to !TimC to see if we can sneak it into the release.
