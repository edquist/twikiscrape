---++ Individual Updates

Doug: Working with Hadoop test stand. to test Hadoop 0.20 packages from Brian. Running into quite a few problems, but he&#39;s likely to have something workable by the end of the week. Brian is fixing the RPMs in response to his bug reports.  Also working with xrootd: gotten mock running, have built xrootd rpms from CERN folks. They are more or less working. Doug has been building the RPMs and Tanya has been testing them. Only minor bugs, no show stoppers. 

Neha: Produced new dChache security release. Testing of Gratia storage/transfer probes for release. Updating MySQL modules for storage/transfer probes (switch from SQLAlchemy to something else.) The usual tickets about storage issues.

Jeff: Also doing Hadoop installs on his own test stand. Independent testing, and separate issues, reported back to Brian. Agrees that we can have release sorted out by the end of the week. Needs help with disk space on library, Alain will help resolve. [[HDFS020][Hadoop issues]]

Scot: VDT 2.0.0p26 (OSG 1.2.18) release out the door. All known RSV issues are fixed, including Doug&#39;s fix for SRMCONFIG environment variable. Working on next release: Gratia probe update, particularly fix for SGE; Updates to Bestman and Bestman 2 signed off on by Tanya; CMS-requested changes for GRAM; 

Mat: Improving Globus build, particularly init script for GridFTP in globus-base-data-server (needed for Xrootd). Looking at EMI&#39;s RPMs for glexec, LCAS, and LCMAPS. 

Alain: Working on various management tasks, particularly related to upcoming meeting with Executive Team on Thursday.
