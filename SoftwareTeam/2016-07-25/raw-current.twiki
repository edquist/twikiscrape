---+++ Discussion

   * New VO package coming down the pike; probably Kyle Gross will be doing
     the work, but Carl should make a JIRA ticket
   * New Condor release expected this Friday, to go into upcoming. Edgar may
     have to merge his BLAHP changes

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * !StashCache: All caches moved successfully to a new redirector.
     Ongoing developent of =stashcp= by !UChicago - great progress on that.

---+++ Last Week

   * !StashCache moving forward
   * GRACC moving forward. Better at detecting problems with Gratia probes than Gratia:
     Gratia database contains a lot of duplicates, but GRACC filters these out
   * New stable release of CE View, hoping to get that working at the GOC

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.
