---++ SHA-2 Certificate Handling

As part of his [[Sha2Support][ongoing SHA-2 testing]], Suchandra has completed some basic GUMS tests using SHA-2 certificates (host and user proxy). At first, he encountered fatal errors, which were initially attributed to the aged copy of the EMI trustmanager that ships with GUMS. However, further effort revealed that the errors resulted from misconfiguration. In the latest tests, GUMS works fine with the SHA-2 certificates, even in cases when GUMS contacts a VOMS server (with or without SHA-2 certificates itself). So at this time, we believe that GUMS is ready to handle SHA-2 certificates. However, our installation (and especially the upgrade) documentation needs to be updated to reflect current configuration practices.

Also, Brian noted that the old !jGlobus and !gLite trustmanager !JARs that ship with GUMS are not used for SSL, just (relatively) harmless utility functionality. The GUMS package ultimately depends on =emi-trustmanager=, which is fairly up-to-date at version 3.0.3.

---++ Configuration File Format

Prior to the call, there had been some email about the format of the =gums.config= file that ships with the GUMS packages. It is in the latest format and thus is fine.

However, there is [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-version/gums.template a sample GUMS configuration file]] hosted at the GOC. It can be used with the GUMS function to merge a configuration file into its internal configuration. The current version of this file is 0.4.x and uses the old format. Can it be updated to the GUMS 1.3 format? Probably, but we need to look into the consequences of doing so. Perhaps it would be best simply to ship a second version of the file in the new format. In any case, because the GOC GUMS configuration template contains a list of standard OSG !VOs, the GUMS template should be updated whenever the list of !VOs changes.

---++ Interoperability

Historically, there have been two XML protocols that GUMS has used: SAML and XACML. The use of SAML is deprecated, and OSG has been working to get rid of it everywhere. But this change has never been announced formally to the OSG, so there are mixed messages about its status. GUMS 1.3.18 has broken support for SAML. It could probably be fixed, but the proposal is to leave it broken and instead work on the social changes to get rid of SAML entirely.

---++ Pre-RFC Proxy Support

In other testing, Neha discovered that GUMS does not work with pre-RFC proxies. When Brian investigated, he found that (a) there was an older (fixed) bug that allowed pre-RFC proxies to work without validation, and (b) the now-correct validation code was always broken and did not accept valid pre-RFC proxies. These bugs were/are in the EMI trustmanager. He wrote a patch to fix the OID for pre-RFC proxies, but things are still broken.

Brian thinks that we can fix the remaining bugs with pre-RFC proxy support with relatively little effort. First, we need to retest GUMS and pre-RFC proxies with the newly patched trustmanager, then figure out next steps.

Pre-RFC proxies are not well loved, but they are used enough that we should support them fully. In particular, Pacman VDT distributions defaulted to issuing pre-RFC proxies.

---++ Scalability

!FermiGrid testing has shown that the current GUMS can achieve 99 mappings/second, which is on par with their old installation of GUMS. Unfortunately, getting this kind of performance required heavy tuning of the Hibernate configuration within GUMS and of Tomcat. The Fermi team is willing to share their final configuration on the OSG !TWiki.

John wants to add a simple form of caching for identical requests within a small time window, thereby completely bypassing many layers of software down to the database. He believes that this change will be easy to implement.

Another possible scalability problem lies with the use of an ancient version of Hibernate as the ORM layer. In GUMS 1.4, Jay worked on changing GUMS to use JPA, with Hibernate merely as the implementation for it. But, we will not be making changes of that magnitude to GUMS 1.3. So would it be possible to upgrade GUMS to use the latest Hibernate 3 flavor? There is some evidence that it might just work: John believes that Hibernate keeps a consistent API for its major releases, and Neha experimented with doing the replacement and it did not seem to have worked (In particular, she observed errors like &lt;i&gt;[ERROR]: schema_reference.4: Failed to read schema document &#39;file:/usr/local/vdt-2.0.0/tomcat/v55/webapps/gums//WEB-INF/gums.config.schema&#39;, because 1) could not find the document; 2) the document could not be read; 3) the root element of the document is not &lt;xsd:schema&gt;.
[ERROR]: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element &#39;gums&#39;.&lt;/i&gt;)
. There are lots of tasks to deal with here, but this might be a useful change to GUMS 1.3. In addition to getting performance improvements (such as an internal caching system), using a newer Hibernate might allow us to eliminate many of the old binary !JARs in the build.

---++ Logging Improvements

Brian pointed out a few problems with logging in GUMS, especially that there are three =log4j.properties= files (only one of which is used) and there is an old-sounding EDG log filename. John expressed concerns about changing the logs that are produced, as many sites rely on the exact formatting and contents of the existing logs. Neha echoed this concern with a particular example from Fermi. So the only proposals of interest are ones that retain the existing log filenames, formats, and contents, at least by default.

One simple fix to implement soon is deleting the extraneous =log4j.properties= files. This can be done for now in the GUMS packaging, and later in GUMS itself.

---++ Binary JAR Files

GUMS depends on the use of many binary JAR files, that is, library files included in their final, compiled form. This is a bad practice, from both a packaging and deployment view, and goes against standard packaging guidelines including Fedora’s. It would be best if we could convert as many of the bundled binary JARs into simple package dependencies.

We performed a similar conversion with !BeStMan, but GUMS should be easier to work with because it uses Maven as its build system. (And yes, the OSG build uses the Maven build system still.)

The first step is to identify easy conversions and just do them in the packaging. The Software Team can do this, but must work with John Hover, especially in cases where the dependent package version number changes as a result of the conversion. That is, John must certify that changing the version of a library will continue to work.

Brian suggests that the scariest dependent packages are the privilege JARs, which are currently obtained from Fermi. It would be great to convert those to source RPMs and make them part of our distribution. Switching to a standard, OS-provided version of the Hibernate libraries is a bit scary, due to age and complexity; we will leave this one alone for now. It should be fairly easy, though, to convert to other OS-provided libraries.

---++ Bug: Shortcut Link

In the GUMS web interface, there is a shortcut link in the navigation that is broken. There is [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-796 a JIRA ticket]] for this bug already.

---++ Upgrade Problems

Suchandra encountered problems when upgrading from an OSG 1.2 GUMS installation to the latest OSG 3 one. He will document those problems and we will decide what to do about them.

---++ Banning Strategy

As part of OSG Security, we must have the capability to ban users and groups of users. Where should banning live? Two options are GUMS and SAZ.

For simple banning — i.e., for individual users — GUMS provides an interface and functionality, although the interface needs improvement. There is a JIRA ticket already for improving the GUMS banning interface.

But, John clearly stated that he has no interest in extending the banning functionality of GUMS to include groups, so that functionality would have to come from another component. !FermiGrid has such a component, SAZ, but it is not ready for widespread use yet.

The next big step is to have a discussion about the banning strategy in OSG. Brian suggested the following participants, at minimum: himself, Dan Fraser, Mine Altunay, and Tim Cartwright. Perhaps someone from Operations is needed, too.

---++ Timing of GUMS Changes and Releases

!FermiGrid needs to put GUMS 1.3 into production by the end of October. The OSG Software team could, in principle, do one minor maintenance release of GUMS 1.3.18 by then, incorporating small changes that can be implemented in the packaging alone. Realistically, the next release of the GUMS software itself is several months away and could include more substantial changes (plus upstream changes reflecting any earlier, temporary OSG packaging changes). At this time, there are no plans to release or adopt GUMS 1.4, so proposed changes should fit into the GUMS 1.3 framework.
