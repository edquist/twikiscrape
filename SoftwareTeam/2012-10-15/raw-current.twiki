   * Look into GUMS library improvements (Doug)
   * Identify other easy GUMS improvements (Tim, Brian)
   * Work on GUMS documentation (Suchandra)
   * Test GUMS 1.3.18.009-6 (Suchandra)
   * Finish new HDFS test (Doug)
   * Design next step for testing infrastructure (Tim, Mat)
   * Help Alan Sill and other TTU folks as needed (Suchandra)

   * Write a more explicit proposal for dealing with the LCMAPS packaging changes (?)
   * Ask NIKHEF to version LCMAPS .so files (Brian?)
   * Let Andrea Ceccanti know that pre-RFC proxies are broken in the VOMS client (though we don&#39;t need them fixed right away)
   * Have ITB test VOMS upgrade. (Suchandra, waiting on Mat&#39;s testing)

---++ Notes

---+++ LCMAPS discussion

---++++!! Background and current status

Tim sent out proposal on Sept. 11 on dealing with dependencies between lcmaps packages and its plugins.

lcmaps depends on four of its plugins. (Not all).
The plugins are referred to in lcmaps.db, so they are required for the default config.

There is also a circular dependency: verify-proxy and gums-client should depend on lcmaps (since they link against it).

---++++!! Proposal

Make the plugins depend on the base lcmaps package using a version dependency.
We can use this to make an update to a plugin also update the base, if needed.
Also add an =osg-lcmaps= metapackage, which depends on the lcmaps base package and those 4 plugins.

Since =/etc/lcmaps.db= is an OSG addition, it should be moved to the =osg-lcmaps= metapackage.
Care must be taken, however, so that people&#39;s =/etc/lcmaps.db= files do not get renamed when the =lcmaps= package is upgraded from a version that owns =/etc/lcmaps.db= to one that does not.

Also have newer =lcmaps= conflict with older, incompatible plugins.
Perhaps the =osg-lcmaps= metapackage can require specific versions of =lcmaps= and the plugins.

!XRootD also has a similar problem.
For that we will have to update the requirements on its plugins each time a new major version comes out.
!XRootD explicitly requires plugins that were built against the same version of !XRootD.
It will bail at runtime though so we cannot rely on RPM to enforce that restriction by itself.

We should turn the =.mod= files into =.so= files and make =.mod= -&amp;gt; =.so= symlinks.
Seems like some plugins already have that.
We should also get NIKHEF to start versioning their shared libraries.
These two steps combined with having the plugins link against the lcmaps libraries should get RPM to help us with the dependency issues.

---+++ Other
   * Andrew Norman having =gsissh= problems. Doug to be pinging people as needed.

   * Some people are having trouble with =itb-ca-certs=. We don&#39;t ship those, but Anand is supposed to update them whenever we push a new set of CA certs to testing. We should see if that happened.
