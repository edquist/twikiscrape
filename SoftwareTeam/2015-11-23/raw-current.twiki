*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
   * The software development and packaging freeze is today, and there are many tickets labeled for the release that are still in progress. Please finish tickets today, label them for another release, or talk to !TimC about brief delays.
   * Jose noted reports of problems at AGLT2 (in Michigan). He will ask the site admins to make a GOC ticket. [Later, he reported that the issues were not due to OSG Software, so no ticket was created.]
