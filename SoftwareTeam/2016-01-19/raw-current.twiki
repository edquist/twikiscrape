*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
   * We (Software, Release, and Operations) need to establish a policy and process for promoting OSG software packages from development to GOC release. !TimT agreed to write a first draft. Early candidates for moving to the GOC repos include =oasis=.

---+++ Support Update
   * Caltech (Marian) - Awaiting response about upgrade
   * Clemson - Factory walltime implemented (was not before). Jobs still being removed, admin investigating
   * Harvard (Marian) - Awaiting holes to be poked in the firewall to test remote job submission
   * FIU - Pilots only running for a few minutes, causing thrashing. Seems to be firewall issues, admin investigating
   * OSC - Disabled the SEG and problems went away. There may be a fix coming upstream.
   * Utah - Had lengthy phone call to answer Guy&#39;s questions. He will contact Bo for cert help and will try setting up the CE on his own.

---+++ Major Activities
   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])

   * !StashCache:
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.
      * Working to get &quot;all green&quot; in monitoring - i.e., using the probes we already developed.
      * Submitting jobs using !StashCache through !NoVA production system.
   * CE-View (part of HTCondor-CE): got OK from AGIS team, will try to get it in the HTCondor-CE release.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report.
   * LIGO: LIGO workflow made widely deployable; now on &gt;5 sites and passed 10k hours / day.
