   * Cleanup up JIRA and koji to make a smoother transition to having separate Software and Release teams
   * !BrianL successfully built HTCondor on Debian locally using standard Debian methods
   * Mat helped Nate set up !GridFTP and HDFS for CHTC

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * Release 3.1.18: Tomorrow, !BrianL will help !TimT; !HTCondor 7.8.8, Java 1.6.0p45, !jGlobus patch, client tarballs
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: Announce packages in testing
   * HDFS 2: Mat will work on build failures on EL5
   * Remaining fixes to osg-ca-scripts for client tarballs
   * Update to OASIS package (Dave Dykstra)
   * HTCondor-CE: Need to determine packaging tasks
   * Updates to osg-configure to support OASIS

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: Being defined
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * BOSCO (soon-ish, comes along with HTCondor 7.9)

---+++ Notes

*OSG CA scripts:* !BrianL still needs to fix a set of problems when setting up a symlink to the CA certificates directory in a non-standard location.

*OASIS:* !BrianB sees three main tasks remaining (in order of importance):
   * Update the OASIS configuration file(s) (Dave Dykstra); waiting on URL of BNL stratum 1 server
   * Update the OSG documentation; OASIS needs to be integrated into the CE install
   * Might need some osg-configure changes (Suchandra)

*HTCondor-CE:* Need to package HTCondor 7.9.5 first. !BrianL will need to spend a fair amount of time this month working on it. !BrianL is also working on taking over the HTCondor Debian packaging, but that will be a much lower priority.

---++ OSG Release Team

---+++ Projects

   * Release 3.1.18 (see above)
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: ITB and other external testing
   * SLURM: Scalability testing continues
   * !DigiCert SHA-2 testing
   * OASIS documentation

---+++ Notes

*SHA-2:* Need to do one last round of SHA-2 compliance testing; Neha and Suchandra to work on this. Need to test !DigiCert-signed host and user certificates. !BeStMan testing should wait until after the Tuesday release, just to be sure.

*Documentation:* Marco has some documentation projects assigned to software team members. There are generally JIRA tickets or GOC tickets for people that don’t have JIRA. People encouraged to spend some time on documentation.
