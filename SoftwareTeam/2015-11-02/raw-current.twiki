%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| OSG CA | 3.2.29 / 3.3.3 | N/A | 2015-10-26 | 2015-11-03 | Special Release of IGTF 1.69 with OSG CA |
| November | 3.2.30 / 3.3.4 | 2015-10-26 | 2015-11-02 | 2015-11-10 | |
| December | 3.2.31 / 3.3.5 | 2015-11-23 | 2015-11-30 | 2015-12-08 | |
| January | 3.2.32 / 3.3.6 | 2015-12-28 | 2016-01-04 | 2016-01-12 | 5 week cycle |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
   * *OSG 3.3 and HTCondor 8.4.* There is a bug in HTCondor 8.4.1 that breaks the CE, and OSG does not want to ship the broken 8.4.1. !TimT is working with Zach to determine if the HTCondor issue can be fixed in time. We would like the other bug fixes in 8.4.1, so we will see what happens. !TimT plans to make a firm decision today.

   * *!BeStMan and GUMS clients.* !BeStMan itself does not require the GUMS clients, but the Gratia probes for !BeStMan transfers use some GUMS functions to reverse-map Unix usernames and DNs back to VOs. So for now, we can create a clipped version of osg-se-bestman that leaves out the bits that do not work – we should have this metapackage anyway or else a !BeStMan release does not mean much in practice. Longer term, !BrianL will review osg-test to see if we actually need the GUMS stuff, and if not consider making a separate top-level package for testing (although there are downsides to doing so, especially if we want to make better Gratia integration tests that actually look at the results of “doing stuff”). Also see SOFTWARE-1888 for some history on aspects of all this.

   * *Routine test failures.* It seems that there are some lingering, repeated test failures – some consistent (e.g., clean up failures) and some not. !BrianL will keep careful track of failures for a week or two, add anything repeated to SOFTWARE-1996, and start to work on those.

   * *Year 4 plans.* !TimC will review the Software team plans for Year 4 and maybe start some new projects. The OSG fiscal year (for planning) starts on 1 June, so we are in month 5 now.

   * !TimT is doing the special CA certificate release tomorrow, so if he asks for Software team help on it, that is a top priority.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * OASIS: Production deploy went out with a few minor (fixed) issues.  Looks like the client-side changes won&#39;t make the November release.
   * !StashCache:
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.  CVMFS team has accepted two of four PRs (one of which has been merged for release).  Have another meeting with them on November 9.
      * DNS alias still giving problems with !XRootD rediretor.
   * CEMon (part of HTCondor-CE): waiting on response from AGIS.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report.
   * LIGO: Hacked-up science workflow succeeding; will help LIGO remove hacks over the next week to make it widely deployable.
