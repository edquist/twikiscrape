---++ Notes

*Release 3.1.14:* Going out tomorrow. Release 3.1.15 tentatively on 5 March. People should take a look at the package list. Suchandra to wrangle release.

*Doug Strain:* Must complete brain dumps from Doug Strain this week! We wish you the best out in California. Stay in touch.

*Java migration:* Mat working through a first build to make sure everything is working; working through some =ant= issues at the moment. Most things ready in Koji and Subversion to start doing Java builds. Mat, Carl, Suchandra to start hopefully later this week; others to join later on. Tim will build a tracking chart on the TWiki this week, with input from others.

*Fetch CRL:* Tim to (re)start project plan pages; did fetch-crl as a sample; please send feedback. Intended audience is primarily area coordinators and other external people, although the plans will often contain milestone dates and so forth that should be of interest to the team as well.

*Non-root installs:* Need to make progress, but got stuck; Mat and Tim need to talk to Brian B.

*SLURM:* Suchandra does not think SLURM will hit the 3.1.15 release. Need several weeks for testing, including a week or two for Igor’s scalability testing. So, we will say that SLURM support is in testing for the All Hands and aim for a release afterward.

*Oklahoma:* Suchandra running tests to debug the site for Horst. This will be Suchandra’s second priority (Java is top) this week.
