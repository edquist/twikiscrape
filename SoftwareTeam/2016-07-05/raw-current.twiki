*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

   * Some blahp tickets not marked for testing - but parent ticket is RFT, so subtickets should be marked RFT too.
   * Need to poke Anand to get IGTF release done.
   * blahp needed to be rebuilt for upcoming, but testing for 3.3 should be sufficient for testing upcoming as well.

---+++ Support Update

   $ Clemson: 95% of glideins held for mysterious reasons - probably PBS Pro issue, but might be getting better. No explanation yet.
   $ Utah: still installing CVMFS. CE is up and running.
   $ GA Tech: - !BrianL needs to talk to !GThain for help on this.
   $ IIT: Derek, Suchandra helping. IIT will host their own CE. Installing a CE BOSCO because the admin has multiple clusters he wants to make available and is more familiar with BOSCO.
