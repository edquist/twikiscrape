---+++ Discussions


---+++ Support Update

   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - CE up and running! Still some solutions to be fleshed out on the UW frontend so that VO sub-projects are recognized
   * Caltech (!BrianL) - Found that jobs removed at the CE-level count as &#39;failed&#39; jobs in the job routing table, which leads to job throttling ([[https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5968][Gittrac#4968]])
   * PDSF (!BrianL) - Kernel panics
   * Utah (!BrianL) - Needs help with job routes because they now have SL7 worker nodes as well as SL6
