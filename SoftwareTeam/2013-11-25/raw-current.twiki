%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * osg-info-services: cut version 1.0 on Monday (Mat)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: working on bugs with Jaime Frey (Suchandra)
   * Make RSV Java probe work locally: strive to finish Wednesday; !TimT authorizes late addition (Carl; [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1147][SW-1147]])
   * Move gridftp-hdfs to Globus: just do it (Mat; [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1214][SW-1214]])
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: define project (!TimC, Mat)
   * Handle empty-* packages better: Finish design and make tickets for actual work (Mat)
   * osg-test: cut new version containing many small improvements (!BrianL; [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-649][SW-649]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-810][SW-810]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1208][SW-1208]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1266][SW-1266]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1292][SW-1292]])
   * Automated testing: many tasks defined to finish production workflow (!BrianL, Mat, !TimC)
   * Support HCC and US-ATLAS in Koji: configure security policies, may wait until testing freeze has passed (Mat)
   * Futuregrid: setting up (Igor)
   * UW ITB site: settle on an initial architecture, define tasks for Infrastructure (Mat, et al.)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * RSV for VOs (Carl, !BrianB)
   * Globus Toolkit update: define and schedule update project (!TimC, Mat)

---+++ Notes

*JIRA Labels:* It is confusing to the Tims when a ticket is labeled for the next release, but there is no firm intention to have the ticket ready for the named release(s). The Software team will try to label tickets for a given release *if and only if* there is a reasonable expectation that the work will be completed for that release. Of course there will be changes, sometimes last minute, but the goal is to express real intent.

*Thanksgiving:* Everyone except Edgar will be out of the office on Friday. !TimC will check in by email a few times that day, too.

---+++ Notes

*JIRA Tickets:* Be sure to &quot;Label&quot; the ticket for a release. The &quot;Fix Version&quot; field is filled in at release time.

*This Release:* Majority of tickets are not ready for testing/release. Need to evaluate what can be accomplished.
