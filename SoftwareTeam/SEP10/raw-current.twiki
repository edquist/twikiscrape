---++ Proposed changes in OSG 1.2.12.

This is the list of changes we propose to have in OSG 1.2.12. (That is, these are the differences from OSG 1.2.11.). The primary goal is to update RSV. 

   * RSV Updates
      * Add rsv-control, a new tool to simplify management and configuration of RSV. In particular, it will be able to:
         * Enable or disable individual metrics
         * List all metrics and their state
         * Test a given metric
         * Run all metrics immediately. This is useful to test a site after installation or after an update.
         * Show the queue (Condor Cron queue) of RSV jobs more clearly. 
         * Configure-OSG will be able to disable a section of configuration, particularly RSV. [[Integration/RFC8][RFC #8]]
         * Improvements to the output of the RSV site web page (a.k.a the &quot;HTML consumer&quot;)
         * Underlying tweaks to the internals of RSV configuration
      * Add new information services (GIP) RSV metrics
      * Add new !ReSS RSV metrics 

---++ Schedule
We plan to begin testing OSG 1.2.12 in mid-May. Because it touches a fair amount of RSV, it may take a little while to sort it out.

---++ Comments?
If you have comments, please let the VDT team know.
