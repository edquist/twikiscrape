---++ Notes

*2013 OSG User School:* Applications opened today. Tim will be busier with the School until it is done (early July). Request: Forward the announcement and post the flyer, if you can.

*Release 3.1.15:* Releasing tomorrow. Madison team will cut the release, probably Carl or !BrianL, with assistance as needed.

*Java:* Neha tested !BeStMan 2, which seems to work fine with a minor config change to the sysconfig file. She also tested GUMS on SL5, but there were some broken symlinks despite having reinstalled !OpenJDK 1.7. Carl tested the VOMS Admin server, which seems to work on EL5 and EL6. Hadoop 2.0 builds on EL6, but not EL5; Carl will let !BrianB know what the problems are, in case Brian knows an easy fix. Neha will take a first pass at testing the Gratia service, and will work with Tanya when more testing is needed.

*Tarball clients:* Mat is working on the tarball creation and post-install scripts; the initial creation script is nearly done and already creates all 8 tarballs. !BrianL is working on updating the Perl scripts in osg-ca-scripts. %RED%Are there any other OSG packages that contain scripts and that are installed in the clients that need work?%ENDCOLOR%

*Fetch CRL:* Ready to go tomorrow. Need to find packages that required Fetch CRL to work, but do not currently have a Depends: on it. We know of GUMS and Gratia Service. We should add a dependency on Fetch CRL to =osg-gums= and probably to =gratia-service=. Documentation for some of the SE software does not include starting and stopping fetch-crl, so Marco will add it.

*osg-ca-scripts:* The osg-ca-cert-status script included in osg-ca-scripts package seems completely broken. Is it used? Can we drop it?

*SLURM:* Back to scalability testing, which may happen yet this week.

*VOMS client:* Still need to update it so that it issues SHA-2 proxies. Clients completely rewritten in Java for version 3; old client will not be updated with SHA-2 support. We can either ship version 3 or patch version 2 ourselves.

*Oklahoma:* Suchandra will try to schedule an in-person debugging session with Horst at the AHM next week.

*AHM:* Technology and Software groups will tentatively get together for dinner on Wednesday evening.
