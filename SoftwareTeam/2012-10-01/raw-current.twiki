---+ OSG Software Team Meeting, 1 October 2012

*Attending:* Doug, Marco, Mat, Neha, Suchandra, Tim

---++ Opening

*Triage Duty:* Mat this week, Tim next week; 6 open tickets.

*OSG Deployments:* OSG 3.x: 45 (-2) last week; 18 using 3.1.8; OSG 1.2: 54 sites, 22 using 1.2.29. Marco explained that the report is showing only currently active sites, so these are dependent on RSV reports; fluctuations should be expected.

No comments received yet on format of this meeting [well, actually, Mat give Tim some feedback in person after the meeting].

---++ Accomplishments

   * Released 3.1.9. Had to pull Condor 7.8.4 the next day, then unpull Condor 7.8.4 the day after that.
   * Released OSG 1.2.30 with JDK update.
   * Doug updated !XRootD + GSI tests to support SHA-2 testing.
   * Mat, Tim, with help from Brian worked on an lcmaps packaging issue with plugin modules. Patched mash (the software with which we create our repos), sent patch to the GOC. We want them to install it when our next release comes. (Scheduled for next Tue, Oct 9).
   * Packaged =osg-pki-tools=, tools for requesting Digicert certificates. Von and other security folks are doing training using these new tools.

---++ Issues

   * No big blockers for OSG 3 deployments at VOs.
   * SHA-2 is still our big issue. Not much to report this week. People are working on !JGlobus, GUMS, and !XRootD + GSI.
   * GUMS 1.3.18 has lots of issues — we will schedule a conference call to discuss it.
   * Texas Tech (Alan Sill) still having issues getting to OSG 3. We solved VOMS issues and GSI-OpenSSH issues for them and updated documentation. This is an ITB site, so it is small but visible and important. Suchandra currently helping them debug. We should be proactive in fixing problems in our documentation, packaging, etc. Make a ticket, let them see the ticket, etc.
   * Upcoming release: 3.1.10. This is a small release on Tue, 9 October. It will contain the latest IGTF CA certificate distribution, plus anything else that is rock solid by the Friday freeze; may include osg-pki-tools, condor-7.8.5, and mash.

---++ Actions

   * Lots of SHA-2 testing (Neha, Suchandra)
   * Discussion about GUMS 1.3.18 (John, Neha, Tim)
   * Investigation of Texas Tech issues (Suchandra will lead and bring in others as needed)
   * Investigation of new !BeStMan 2 release; may not need to update to this release, but we need to make sure that our patches continue to work for each upstream release
   * RSV updates (Mat)
   * Fix osg-cleanup (to deal with Globus changes) (Mat)
   * Investigate SL 5 nightly test failures (Mat)
   * Prepare any other packages for Friday noon freeze (*all*)
