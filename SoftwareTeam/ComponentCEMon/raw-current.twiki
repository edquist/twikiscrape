---+ OSG Software Component: CEMon

---++ Purpose

The CEMon service provides a common interface for publishing information about a Computing Element (CE). The framework can be configured with multiple sensors for collecting data from different sources, such as the [[ComponentGIP][Generic Information Provider]]. The information can be published in multiple formats, such as LDIF and !ClassAds. Conceptually, one can think of CEMon as being a cron job and a script that periodically pushes a data file to a web server, but in fact it is a giant Tomcat web application that implements similar functionality.

Currently in OSG, CEMon invokes the [[ComponentGIP][GIP]] every 5 minutes (or is it 10 minutes?).
