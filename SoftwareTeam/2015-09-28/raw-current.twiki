*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
   * Despite there being many tickets awaiting promotion to testing, all developers are confident that they will deliver on time

---+++ Notes


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * OASIS:
      * Arrived at a new scheme for enabling _any_ CVMFS domain (not limited to *.opensciencegrid.org or *.egi.eu) while following all policies we have put in place.
         * See https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OO-103
      * Working with GOC on improving monitoring.
   * StashCache:
      * StashCache tester now running reliably nightly.  Working on historical visualization of cache performance.
      * Got prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache working.
   * CEMon (part of HTCondor-CE): Working on a default, simple monitoring app that can be run underneath the HTCondor-CE.  Provides a &quot;JSON&quot; and &quot;web view&quot; of what&#39;s happening on the local CE.
      * Example: http://red-foreman.unl.edu:4440
      * Hoping to send a PR soon (this week).  More details about architecture / etc will come with PR.
      * This can be run in &quot;grid wide mode&quot;; this provides a JSON view of the data in collector.opensciencegrid.org.  In discussion with AGIS folks about using this to provide a view of OSG for AGIS.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: Starting to &quot;whiteboard&quot; ideas on how to have the OSG-CE install a BOSCO-based backend.
      * Mat, expect questions from Derek soon.
      * Starting with improving HTCondor-CE / BLAHP / Gratia integration.
   * Slack: Quite a few folks are starting to hang out on Slack on the Open Science Grid team (mostly run by UChicago team).  Contact Lincoln Bryant if you&#39;d like access.
