%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
HTCondor 8.4.10 and 8.5.8 are expected to be released today, after which we can finish builds, tests, and promotions for [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2541][SW-2541]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2545][SW-2545]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2534][SW-2534]]. But Tim T. said that the HTCondor releases are looking unlikely, in which case all three tickets will be moved to January.

After some deliberation last week, we decided switch to Ansible for managing the Madison ITB site. It seems plenty capable, understandable, and easy to use for both routine configuration and one-off commands. FYI.

---+++ Support Update

   * BU (!BrianL) - CE losing track of SGE jobs
   * IIT (!BrianL) - user had issues/questions with file transfer during job eviction (this probably should have gone to user support)
   * Russian Data-Intensive Grid (!BrianL) - Troubleshooting issue submitting to PBS cluster (https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/31952)
   * Wisconsin (!BrianL) - Dan Bradley needs to report locally run jobs, discussing with the accounting team how they would like these jobs to be reported (https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31438)
   * Utah (Derek) - Issues with CVMFS.  Dave Dykstra is helping Utah now with this problem.
