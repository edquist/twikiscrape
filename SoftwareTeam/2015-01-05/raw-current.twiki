%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| January | 3.2.19 | 2014-12-29 | 2015-01-05 | 2015-01-13 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Code Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

BDII Transition:
   * CE Collector - last deployment / operational bugs hammered out before Christmas.  Currently 14 CEs in the info sys.
   * In the next few weeks, will be starting to define projects to help VOs / operations adopt to &quot;BDII-free” sites - replacing BDII with some combination of !MyOSG and CE Collector.
   * Q from !TimC: How does the functionality compare against BDII?  A: Currently, some manual intervention is needed to define endpoints using BDII (BDII is used to “bootstrap”; human fixes obvious problems).  Goal here is to make the manual intervention optional (although likely a human will always review changes).  Currently, CE Collector only contains viable information for single-core jobs; these bugs are identified and hopefully fixed for next version.

Scalability:
   * Wrapped up at the end of last year.  Edgar was able to do one last re-test of the HTCondor CE and got up to 16k jobs running. Still believe that the current bottleneck is the sleeper pool at Nebraska, *not* the HTCondor CE.
   * Q from Jeff: I can envision that we may find scale problems if we put all entry points in the ITB when doing the BDII transition work (mentioned above).  Will we be able to continue scale test for that?  A: Let’s enumerate all the needed scale tests and &quot;save them up” for a larger round of testing in a few months.
