*Attending:* Brian, Doug, Igor, Marco, Mat, Neha, Tim, Xin

---++ Announcements

*Triage Duty:* Doug this week, Suchandra next week; %RED%18 open tickets%ENDCOLOR%.

*OSG Deployments:*
| OSG 3.x | 63 (+5) sites | 17 (+3) using 3.1.12 |
| OSG 1.2 | 39 (–2) sites | 3 (+1) using 1.2.31 |

---++ Accomplished

   * Completed *lots* of testing: !BeStMan 2 (etc.), !XRootD, GUMS, Pakiti, OASIS configuration, osg-cleanup, ...
   * Rebuilt !GridFTP modules (xrootd, hdfs) to work with new !GridFTP build
   * Added Fermicloud testing scripts to tools directory in Subversion
   * Updated osg-build to 1.2.4
   * Drafted proposals for Fetch CRL, JDK change, and osg-upcoming

---++ In Progress

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state.

---+++ Special Topics

   * Doug Strain
   * JIRA reminders (Tim)

---+++ Next Release (3.1.13)

   * Tim will cut release
   * Any outstanding issues?

---+++ Ongoing

   * Replace Oracle JDK 6 with something supported
   * Make client available as non-root install (i.e., tarballs)
   * New “Upcoming/Frontier” repository, initially for HDFS 2.0: Started design
   * SLURM: Debugging and find out about state of TTU work here
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * Help debug Oklahoma (Horst)

---++ Coming Soon

   * HTCondor name change (pending, eventually)
   * HTCondor-CE (February) — may be handled by Technology for now
   * BOSCO (soon-ish, comes along with HTCondor 7.9)

---++ Planned For This Week

   * Release 3.1.13
   * Finish up frontier-squid (release in two weeks)
   * Work on Fetch CRL v3 on el5
   * Push ahead with design for Java update, nonroot client, and “upcoming” repository

---++ Notes

*Non-root clients:* Priority has gone up a lot. This especially came up because of !BeStMan 2 stuff: A new !BeStMan server with SHA-2 certificates will break all old clients.

*Doug:* Last day will be February 15. Tim will start assigning items to transition. Feel free to push back (within reason!).

*Release 3.1.13:* Tim will do the release. Draft list has gone out; people should take a look. Brian suggests we should go through development to see what might need to be promoted to testing.

*Release 3.1.14:* Hopefully two weeks from tomorrow (12 February). Mostly due to frontier-squid, which just barely missed the window. We want people to switch to frontier-squid mostly. New CA certificates will also go in — this is not the one with the SHA-2 certs.

*Release 3.1.15:* Next _big_ release. Late February, early March. Fetch CRL to v3 on el5, maybe !HTCondor-CE, maybe SLURM, maybe lcg-util-1.14, the GridFTP upgrade, lcmaps, !gLExec, VOMS.

---+++ Upcoming hard issues

Java switch. This week we need to settle on which JDK to move to. After that we can start doing some real testing. Exact difficulty of the entire switch unknown. This project will have definite attention from Production.

Non-root install. Once we&#39;ve figured out what to do, the actual implementation should not be that difficuly -- we may even give that to a newbie.

&quot;Upcoming&quot; repository. Might be a good place to put the new Java packages.
