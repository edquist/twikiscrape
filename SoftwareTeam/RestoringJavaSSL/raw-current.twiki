---+ Restoring SSL After Java 7u75 Update

Around 20 January 2015, the Java 7u75 update came out (at least in the OS repositories). One significant change in that release was to drop SSL support by default, even though the code itself still shipped. If a site needs to re-enable Java SSL after this update, they can use the information below.

---++ Restoring SSL

This Oracle document contains a brief mention of how to re-enable SSL:

In a nutshell:

   1. Edit the =/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.*/jre/lib/security/java.security= file (where =*= depends on your exact install)
   1. Find the =jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms= property
   1. If the property has multiple values, remove =SSLv3= from the list; if only =SSLv3= is listed, comment out the entire line\
      &lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;# jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3&lt;/pre&gt;

But as the page says: “It should be noted that SSLv3 is obsolete and should no longer be used.”
