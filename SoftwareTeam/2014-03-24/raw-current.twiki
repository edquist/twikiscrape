%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Version*         | *Testing*  | *Freeze*   | *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.2.7 (high priority) | 2014-03-17 | 2014-03-17 | 2014-03-25 |         |
| 3.1.32 / 3.2.8    | 2014-03-24 | 2014-03-31 | 2014-04-08 |         |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * Fix for Globus Job Manager crasher: ready to go! (Mat, !TimT)
   * Help HTCondor developers build HTCondor RPM in Koji: !TimT to test (!TimT, Mat)
   * Set up !perfSONAR space in Koji: !perfSONAR developers to test (Mat)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: Scalability testing at UCSD, hopefully starting this week (Edgar)
   * Disaster recovery for OSG/Madison: improvements as background task, waiting on IU for offsite backups (Mat)
   * !GridFTP testing for UDT driver: !GridFTP work fine (OSG 3.2/EL6 only), still working on !GridFTP-HDFS (different config file) (Carl)
   * Gratia-Probe testing (Carl)
   * Automated testing:
      * Enable HTCondor-CE and !MyProxy tests in nightlies: working on fixes to make this happen (!BrianL)
      * Finish initial HTCondor-CE tests: htcondor-ce-trace still in progress (!BrianL)
      * Investigate possibility of adding HTCondor policy to identify and force-vacate VMU jobs (!BrianL &amp;rarr; FW)
      * Start design document for osg-test 2.0 (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * UW ITB site (Mat, !TimC)
      * Document basic Puppet structure and conventions (Mat)
      * Learn Puppet
      * Assign initial machine set-up and configuration tasks to team members (!TimC)
   * Document our documentation needs (!TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)
   * Many more things … coming soon …

---+++ Notes

*GridFTP-HDFS:* Open a separate ticket for modernizing the configuration, distinct from UDT driver.

*Git:* Will arrange a phone call with !BrianB, Mat, and !TimC to resurrect.

*GUMS:* Found another sub package that is in danger of disappearing (privilege-xacml). Abandonware; only used by OSG. Upside: Maybe the last truly scary dependency in GUMS.

*GOC ticket about CEMon:* After a great deal of debugging, Edgar is stuck. However, this is a new site for Iwona, so we can nicely ask her to upgrade to OSG 3.2.
