%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Completed

   * !BrianB, !TimC, and !TimT met at Fermi and had a productive discussion about future Technology Area work
   * Drafted a recipe to restore our Koji instance to a new machine from backups ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1139][SW-1139]])
   * Cut vo-client with v51 data from Soichi ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1372][SW-1372]])

   * Reviewed and updated the list of OSG Globus patches ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-790][SW-790]])
   * Finished replicating !glideinWMS performance tests with the updated !GlideTester

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * !perfSONAR: talk to local users about issues, talk to developers about ideas for improvement (Mat, !TimC)
   * Fix osg-configure bugs for March release (Suchandra)
   * Freeze gratia-probe changes, test thoroughly, and fix bugs for March release (Suchandra, Tanya)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: NFS is set up, but jobs are being held still; will talk to Jaime; will upgrade to htcondor-ce-0.6.0 (Suchandra)
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: test Koji recovery to VM, continue building Koji configuration in Puppet (Mat)
   * Automated testing: Enable HTCondor-CE tests in nightlies (!BrianL); start design document for osg-test 2.0 (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * UW ITB site: waiting for new machines, waiting for old machines to be renamed, check machine setup, pick configuration manager, start assigning installs to team members (Mat, !TimC)

   * Priority on getting osg-configure configuring osg-info-service.
      * Lack of this feature is a barrier to volunteer testing and 3.2 adoption.

---+++ Notes

*gridftp-hdfs:* Problems found during testing. May be dropped from this release.

---++ Extra Topics

*Moving From Subversion to Git:* There is a lot of interest in moving from Subversion to Git, being able to use Github, etc. Fortunately, everyone on the call has experience with git already, so at least that aspect of a transition is easy. Mat will produce an initial design sketch for feedback from the group.

*Effort tracking:* The Software and Release teams will implement a very simple effort tracking system, hopefully by March. All team members will report percentage effort (in the federal reporting sense) for their OSG Software/Release effort, to the nearest 1–5% value, on each weekly status update. The values will be entered into a spreadsheet, summarized, and tracked over time as a way to understand our real effort. This will not be a tool for enforcement, but rather for understanding. There will be a small number of effort categories, to track big-picture effort of the teams. Soon, !TimC will send out a more detailed proposal for feedback, then we will try it out for the rest of February, then we will start implementing it for real in March.
