---+ OSG-Build SVN repo metadata

---++ Background

Shortly after the OSG 3.3.0 release, the 3.3 series had become the main OSG series, and the 3.2 series became the old OSG series.
This was accompanied by moving the SVN branches around so that trunk (which had, up til that point, represented OSG 3.2) became branches/osg-3.2, and branches/osg-3.3 became trunk.
We did the same thing when we switched from OSG 3.1 to 3.2, and had no problems then.

This switchover caused some difficulties, because OSG 3.2 supports el5 and el6, and 3.3 supports el6 and el7.
We changed koji configuration (specifically, the default &#39;build targets&#39;) to ensure that builds go into the OSG 3.3 repos instead of the 3.2 ones.
Because of this, we did not have to change osg-build to build into the 3.3 repos.
However, nothing in the koji configuration or the SVN tree tells osg-build should build for el6 and el7 instead of el5 and el6.
I needed to change osg-build itself to set that.

---++ Proposal

I would like to add some metadata to each branch in SVN that will contain the following:
   * Which Koji repo to build for by default (e.g. osg-3.2, osg-3.3, upcoming).%BR%\
      These should correspond to the values of the &#39;--repo&#39; argument for osg-build
   * Which distro versions to build for (e.g. el6)
This will be kept in a config file (.ini format) named &#39;Branch.ini&#39; in the top level of each branch in SVN, e.g.:
   * native/redhat/trunk/Branch.ini
   * native/redhat/branches/osg-3.2/Branch.ini
osg-build will look for the Branch.ini file in the parent directory of the package being built.
For example, if called as &quot;osg-build koji condor&quot;, it will look for the file &quot;condor/../Branch.ini&quot;.
This is better than hardcoding the SVN layout, because it will work for non-SVN (scratch) builds as well.

If Branch.ini is not found, osg-build will emit a warning and fall back to the current behavior (i.e. using some hardcoded defaults and trying to figure things out from the branch name).

Example &quot;Branch.ini&quot; (for trunk):&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[branch]
repo=osg-3.3
dvers=el6 el7
strict=1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &quot;strict&quot; argument tells osg-build not to accept non-scratch builds into any other repo from that branch.
It may be turned off for personal branches (e.g. &quot;branches/matyas&quot;).
