%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| May | 3.2.23 | 2015-04-27 | 2015-05-04 | 2015-05-12 | |
| June | 3.2.24 | 2015-05-26 | 2015-06-01 | 2014-06-09 | Development Freeze on Tuesday due to Labor Day |
| July | 3.2.25 | 2015-06-29 | 2015-07-06 | 2015-07-14 | 5 week cycle  |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Development Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ To Discuss
   * 23 (of 29) tickets labeled for 3.2.23 and not Ready For Testing – what can be done to get more tickets RFT earlier?
      * The team is aware of the issue and is trying to get better about this
      * This release may be unusual in that there are several clumps of tickets for which final builds will be done today (e.g., HTCondor CE)
   * Does anyone need anything to get their work RFT today?
      * There are some weird rpm verify failures for HTCondor 8.3.* in Upcoming (release and development), but it may not be a regression
