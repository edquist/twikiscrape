---+ Xrootd RPM Phase 1 Requirements

---++ Packages needed
   * xrootd-server 
   * xrootd-client 
   * xrootdfs
   * !GridFTP with xrootd DSI plugin

---++ Platforms

   * Scientific Linux 5
   * 64 bit

---++ Details

   1. Xrootd should be provided as an RPM. (And therefore it&#39;s okay to install as root.)
   1. The xrootd daemons should run as the xrootd user. 
   1. ATLAS system administrators need to be able to configure their system such that they can provide a non-root user with the ability to start and stop the xrootd processes and change configuration files. 
   1. The RPM should be installed in FHS locations.
   1. The package should support all of Xrootd&#39;s authentication methods. However, if it&#39;s significant effort to support Kerberos, it can be dropped.
   1. Upon completion of the RPM installation, the client should be able to copy and retrieve file accessing node directly.
   1. The start and stop scripts and configuration of the following daemons should be available on each xrootd node:
      A. xrootd
         * xrootd data server
         * xrootd daemon for server side inventory
      A. cmsd
      A. frm  
         * purge daemon
         * copy daemon
      A. xrootdfs 
         *  xrootdfs should be able start one or more mount points; each corresponding to a unique redirector or stand alone dataserver
         *  Once xrootdfs has been modified to be started and stopped using the Linux mount command, it should be used instead of /etc/init.d scripts
   1.  rpm used to install xrootdfs binary should include dependancies for all fuse repositories
