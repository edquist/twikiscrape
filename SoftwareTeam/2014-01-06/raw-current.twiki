%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.29 / 3.2.3 | 2013-12-30 | 2014-01-06 | 2014-01-14 | Short testing week due to Holidays |
| 3.1.30 / 3.2.4 | 2014-01-27 | 2014-02-03 | 2014-02-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

No major work items completed due to the holiday and vacations.

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * !OpenSSL issues: continue investigating remaining issues (!BrianL, all)
   * Update Globus Toolkit: work toward rapid promotion to testing, skip SLURM jobmanager (Mat)
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: define project and implement stop-gap measures for Koji (!TimC, Mat)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: Jaime Frey found an HTCondor configuration problem; still restoring ITB site, then testing and investigating (Suchandra)
   * Automated testing: Tweak web and email reporting (!BrianL, all: send feedback!); increase default VOMS Admin timeout, add ability to do trunk tests (!TimC)
   * Support HCC and US-ATLAS in Koji: just need HCC signing key to finish their configuration (Mat)
   * UW ITB site: settle on an initial architecture, define tasks for Infrastructure (Mat, et al.)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * osg-test 2.0 design and implementation (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * Documentation!
   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)

---+++ Notes

*Globus SLURM jobmanager:* The Official Globus jobmanager for SLURM is now available in EPEL. However, we will not package it now, because it is either using the SEG, which has caused problems with other jobmanagers, or is not using SEG, in which case it may cause severe polling problems. Currently, we ship a caching qstat replacement script for the SLURM jobmanager, which is based on the PBS jobmanager without SEG. The UNL systems that use it seem to work fine for Tier 2-sized loads; if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
