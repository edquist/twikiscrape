---++ Notes

The client tarballs, now in beta, are going well. Testers have reported a few small problems, which Mat can easily fix this week.

Xin reported a problem with an old Pacman-based ATLAS worker node package. This is not really an OSG Software issue, but Marco is just using JIRA for this one item as a reminder.

*Java migration:* VOMS-Admin testing went well. Email notifications did not work on EL6, but that behavior is not new and was even reported in a GOC ticket. Next, Carl will test hadoop-0.20, and Neha will test GUMS, Gratia, Bestman2, Dcache-SRMClients need testing. Testers are recording and keeping a list of test cases, which will be useful for manual testing in the future.

The VOMS client (voms-proxy-init) seems to be working properly with both SHA-1 and SHA-2. Suchandra looking for another person for additional testing.
