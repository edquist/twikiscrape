---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Finished internal testing of HDFS 2 and promoted to osg-upcoming-testing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-608][SW-608]])
   * Added a patch to the GRAM job manager ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1077][SW-1077]])
   * Built the new dcache-srmclient, now undergoing internal testing and fixing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1068][SW-1068]])
   * Tested and fixed the latest Gratia probe release ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1032][SW-1032]])
   * Added a check on osg-configure for umask ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1071][SW-1071]])
   * Drafted !HTCondor-CE documentation
   * Added a sysconfig variable for HTCondor so that an admin can set ulimit without changing config files ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1053][SW-1053]])
   * Did an initial build of a unified HTCondor RPM
   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * SHA-2: update dcache-srmclient (Fermi) to very new version to support SHA-2 (Mat)
   * Update OSG documentation to integrate OASIS (e.g., CE install) (Marco, Suchandra)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): integration of Fedora spec file, list of remaining diffs, parallel universe support
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL): do a build of 7.8.8

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * BOSCO? (soon-ish, comes along with HTCondor 7.9)

---+++ Notes

*dcache-srmclient:* Mat is having trouble testing dcache-srmclient. He will ask Neha for guidance when she returns.

*Documentation:* Rob Gardner wants to end Marco’s contributions to OSG software documentation. !TimC will work with Marco, !TimT, Rob, et al. to make a smooth transition. Marco has many open tickets, such as the OASIS documentation (waiting on Scott Teige and !BrianB), each of which will have to be assigned a new owner.

*HTCondor-CE:* The Software team is done with this effort for now.

*Unified HTCondor RPM:* Carl got everything that was in the Fedora RPM but missing from the OSG RPM into the unified RPM. He will compare the unified RPM to the Fedora, OSG, and UNL versions to look for missing features. The lists of feature differences should be on the wiki.

*OSG HTCondor RPM:* Suchandra found a segfault in the schedd in 7.9.6. !BrianB thinks that he touched the relevant code in 8.0.0, so !BrianL should try that. Suchandra is out, but others can test; specifically, !BrianB has access to Suchandra’s CE and can reproduce the problem there.
