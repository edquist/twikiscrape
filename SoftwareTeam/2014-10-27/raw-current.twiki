%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Code Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

         * Finish a draft of an HTCondor CE overview document (!BrianL, !TimC)
         * Monitor and support sites, especially LSF and SGE (!BrianL)
      * Random RSV improvements and bug fixes ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-585][SW-585]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-793][SW-793]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-806][SW-806]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1080][SW-1080]]); finish, build, test, and promote (Carl)
      * Random Configure bug fixes; code done, need build, test, and promote (Mat)
      * RSV !perfSONAR probe: testing recent changes with Soichi (Edgar)
      * EL 7: finish building/adding extra (service) components, especially HTCondor, to test clients more thoroughly (Mat, Carl)
      * !XRootD backup of HDFS accesses: scheduling meeting to discuss planning (Jeff, !TimC, !BrianB)
      * OASIS 2: complete draft packaging, setting up BNL CE (Jose)
      * IPv6: Edgar has VMs ready to try out, !BrianL will test instructions and set-up (Edgar)
      * !PanDA: can we get the server running here and submit one job?; waiting for them on other packages (Carl)
      * Start documenting the state of our documentation (!TimC)

   * Internal
      * osg-test: make a build with GFAL additions? (!BrianL, Carl)
      * Koji using TLS: trying to get people to upgrade (Mat)
      * Koji upgrade: upgrade to EL6 has been tested and should need minimal downtime; upgrading Koji is harder because of database migration (Mat)
      * UW ITB site: build machines with Puppet! (all)
      * Offsite backups: add some monitoring? (Mat)
      * !HTCondor CE and PBS: setting up about 700 cores with PBS and an !HTCondor CE front-end (Edgar)
      * Checking local backups with Nagios: waiting for help from Aaron (Mat)
      * Move OSG software source code (not packaging) to git(hub): discuss plan and timing (Mat, !TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * Start design for new test scheduling subsystem (!TimC, !BrianL)

---+++ Notes

*VOMS Admin and !SSLv3:* We know how to change the trustmanager configuration to remove SSLv3 support, but doing so would affect GUMS installations as well, because the trustmanager configuration is at the Tomcat server level. So, for the November release (or sooner), we will publish the configuration workaround for VOMS Admin web servers. Then, we can attempt to reproduce the !dCache failures in !BeStMan and proceed from there.
