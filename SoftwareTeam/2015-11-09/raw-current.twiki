*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * !StashCache:
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.  CVMFS team has accepted two of four PRs (one of which has been merged for release).  Have another meeting with them on November 9.
      * DNS alias still giving problems with !XRootD rediretor.
   * CEMon (part of HTCondor-CE): waiting on response from AGIS.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report.
   * LIGO: Hacked-up science workflow succeeding; will help LIGO remove hacks over the next week to make it widely deployable.
