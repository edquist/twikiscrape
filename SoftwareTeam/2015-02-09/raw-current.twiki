| February | 3.2.20 | 2015-01-26 | 2015-02-02 | 2015-02-10 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Development Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * (Finally!) Got a successful “at scale” test of the new OASIS S1 blanking scripts. This allowed the new oasis-config to get into this week’s release.
      * Near Future: significant overhaul of oasis-config to allow for automated distribution so new default configs are not tied to the release cycle.
   * Working with USCMS, starting to get serious about next HTCondor CE steps: turn off GRAM and talk to T3s about transition plans.
      * We’ve asked all USCMS Tier-2s to turn off GRAM to save effort on debugging.
   * Another meeting with CERN IT, planning on how to get CMS off the BDII for HTCondor CE sites.
   * Started work on the foundations of the Xrootd caching service.  Concretely, started work to make sure Xrootd server can be managed by the condor_master (which will allow for remote restarts and eventually automated config updates).
   * Upcoming next week: Figure out CHEP paper and attendance plans.
   * Upcoming next week: Deploy new S-0 and login server at GOC ITB.
