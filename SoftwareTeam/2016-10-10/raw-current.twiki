%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| October | 3.3.17 | 2016-09-26 | 2016-10-03 | 2016-10-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
   * Hyak (University of Washington) is massively under-reporting OSG usage, possibly due to a strange PBS configuration for number of cores per execute host. Carl owns the investigation of this issue, bringing in others as needed.

---+++ Support Update

   * ATLAS (!BrianL/Mat) - Requesting that the CE job router names be advertised to the central collector
   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - Blahp segfault due to glexec + disabling limited proxies. Enabled limited proxies, still need to vierify if glideins are completing successfully
   * Caltech (!BrianL) - Found CE jobs being throttled due to legacy script that removed non-CMS jobs


---++ OSG Release Team
   * October 11th Release - OSG 3.3.17
      * !BrianL is handling the [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20labels%20in%20%283.3.17%29%20ORDER%20BY%20status%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20assignee%20ASC][October 11th Release]]

---+++ Discussion

   * Problem: HTCondor 8.5.7 does not interact properly with HTCondor-CE 2.0.9. We will investigate and possibly not release HTCondor 8.5.7.
   * CVMFS 2.3.2 will probably need to be promoted so LIGO can utilize it on the OSG.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Busy with CHEP.
   * GIP publishes queue information, but that&#39;s not available from HTCondor-CE -- need to convince people that it&#39;s not necessary or come up with an alternate solution.

---+++ Last Week

   * Work done with USATLAS to help them replace SRM at one of their sites -- maybe OU or SLAC
   * USATLAS looking at AGIS compatibility layer for the collector.  GOC Collector is now working!  Atlas needs some queue information though.
   * !BrianB considering using a lightweight container API called Singularity as a replacement for glExec;
     opened a ticket for testing their packaging, and writing a wrapper for Condor jobs to use

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.  Still ongoing!
