%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Code Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| Sep | 3.2.15 / 3.1.39 | 2014-08-25 | 2014-09-02 | 2014-09-09 | Package Freeze bumped due to Labor Day |
| Oct | 3.2.16 / 3.1.40 | 2014-09-29 | 2014-10-06 | 2014-10-14 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * In-Progress:
      * HTCondor-CE rollout: Train continues to gather speed.  I&#39;ve seen at least a test CE at all WLCG sites except for MWT2 and MIT (and those sites have been contacted OOB).
      * Will try to revisit !GridFTP-HDFS issues this week.
      * UCSD team making progress toward scale tests, but future of these are somewhat fuzzy to Brian.  From the OSG review we got strong feedback that these are important so we&#39;ll likely figure out a way for them to continue despite Igor&#39;s departure.

   * Upcoming:
      * (Likely) Marian to take over duties from Igor Sfiligoi for WLCG Machine Features task force.  Work remaining still to be determined.
      * (Likely) Start thinking about design of info system for HTCondor-CE.
