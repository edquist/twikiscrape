---++ Announcements 

Still waiting to talk to Miron about the pass-through packaging proposal.

Scot: Updated gatekeeper to run a nice level 20 (lower priority) will be in next release. Most of your VDT time. Working on scripts to clean up Globus cruft soon. 

Matyas: Added small patch to fork job manager as well as larger patch to Condor job manager for accounting groups. &quot;Just a rebuild away&quot;. 

Tim: Mostly focused on OSG Summer School. Largest percent of time for the next week or two. Sarah has taken a lot of the load for details of the school. School is last week of June. 

Alex: working some the NERSC Tier-3 that is having misbehavior, and working on solving the problem. Improving checksum calculations. There will be an update, but doesn&#39;t need to propagate to VDT yet. Also working on some packaging, but a bit stalled due to NERSC Tier-3 work, will get back to it soon. 

Jeff: Hadoop repository: troubleshooting the Hadoop RPMs. Got help from Doug and Brian. Right now, cannot install working installation. Three major sources of problems: (1)changing user from &quot;root&quot; to &quot;hadoop&quot; which prevents administrative tasks; (2) !GridFTP server uses LCMAPS instead of PRIMA and there were rough spots, but fixed now; (3) umask setting is currently incorrect. Relatively close to release. Will get more involved to release and making changes. Will require a bit more than 15% time to get up to speed; but 15% will be sufficient in long term. 

Tanya: Things are going fine. Last week released !Xrootd, in dev repo. One ATLAS Tier-3 has installed and got good feedback. Have not heard back from Doug Benjamin. Just added !XrootdFS. Only thing missing is !GridFTP DSI for dark energy survey. Tanya did a presentation for OSG Council. Has been working on Globus Online. Tanya&#39;s impression is that it&#39;s much more reliable than using globus-url-copy, but not so optimized. 

Neha: Worked with replica manager problems. Nearly finished SQL update for Gratia probe, just need to talk to Philippe and commit to source code repository.

Doug: Did a lot of packaging with !Xrootd. (See Tanya&#39;s report.) Created a small package to configure !XrootdFS. The !GridFTP DSI module: … DETAILS … Pigeon Tools: Doug was running Pigeon Tools and reporting to Gratia and he had failures that reflected badly on sites. Alain suggested custom .ini, Scot suggested !MyOSG should show who reported.
