*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
   * GOC plans only a single release in December: ITB tomorrow (1 December) and production a week later (8 December). Think hard about any Technology Area items to get in there.
   * Automated tests are all red – seems to be a problem handling a routine Fetch CRL error. Under investigation.
   * What is going on with HTCondor and friends? Seems to be a condor-cron problem in 8.5.1; will promote 8.4.2 and investigate 8.5.1 today.

   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])
