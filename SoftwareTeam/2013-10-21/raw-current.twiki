|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: still fixing bugs, may be ready this week (Suchandra)
   * OSG Next project: Koji deployment, 22 October; osg-release, 12 November (Carl)
   * OSG 3.2.0: review planned contents (!TimC, !TimT); prep SVN &amp; Koji (Carl, !BrianL); finish JIRA tickets (all)
   * RSV for VOs: restart work this week, albeit slowly; release planned for December (Carl, !BrianB)
   * Switch to osg-info-services in OSG 3.2: working on osg-info-services, aiming for 1.0 release (Mat, !BrianB)
   * !glideinWMS 3.2.0: waiting for standard 4, aiming for 3.2.0 release (no upcoming first); will need thorough testing (Parag)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: Done!

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Waiting for Globus Toolkit update containing our patches

---+++ Notes

   * There is a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/17526][GOC ticket]] about a potential problem with using current the lcg-util client with !BeStMan 2 on EL5 systems. Neha will try to reproduce the problem in Fermicloud and report back with her results. If the problem is what !BrianB thinks it is, then we may need to add a workaround within the !BeStMan server, so that it can work properly with older clients.
