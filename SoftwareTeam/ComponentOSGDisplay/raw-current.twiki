---+ OSG Software Component: OSG Display

---++ Purpose

The OSG Display software generates usage reports for the number of jobs, cpu hours, and transfers on the Open Science Grid, and is displayed on http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Usage

Run &quot;osg_display&quot; -- this generates the charts and summary numbers seen on http://display.grid.iu.edu/, and is run in regular intervals by cron.

---++ Source

The OSG&#39;s packaging of osg-display-data (previously named OSG_Display_Data) is based on the upstream source from the VDT Software repo under https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/osg-display-data/ (migrated from its original home at svn://t2.unl.edu/brian/osg_display).

The Web UI that displays the data from osg-display-data is maintained by Soichi Hayashi and lives under https://github.com/soichih/osg-display

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

The original software was written by Brian Bockelman, and then later maintained by Ashu Guru. Soichi Hayashi wrote and maintains the Web UI, and takes care of installations on the display and display-itb sites.

In December 2013, Carl Edquist worked with Brian Bockelman to migrate the source from UNL to UW SVN, where it currently lives for future maintenance work.
