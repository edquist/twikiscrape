---+ OSG Software Component: VO Package

---++ Purpose

VOMS clients (e.g., voms-proxy-init) need data to contact a VOMS server. Also, GUMS needs data (in a different format) to contact VOMS server. We distribute this and other related data in the “VO Package”. For our RPM-based distribution, the source package is called =vo-client=.

For each VO, there are two kinds of VOMS contact data:

   * The =/etc/vomses= file contains a single, space separated line of data with the VO alias, host, port, host DN, and VO name:&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&quot;osg&quot; &quot;voms.opensciencegrid.org&quot; &quot;15027&quot; &quot;/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=host/voms.opensciencegrid.org&quot; &quot;osg&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
   * The =/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/&lt;em&gt;VONAME&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;VOHOST&lt;/em&gt;.lsc= file contains the DNs of the host certificate and its CA certificate, on separate lines:&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=host/voms.opensciencegrid.org
/DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1&lt;/pre&gt;

Currently only the host DN in the =.lsc= file is used, so if the DN in the =vomses= file differs, it is ignored.

---++ Usage

Users do not use the data directly, but instead via tools that rely on them. For example, suppose a user runs the following command:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% voms-proxy-init -vo osg
&lt;/pre&gt;

To succeed, =voms-proxy-init= relies on:

   * One line in =/etc/vomses=, starting with =&quot;osg&quot;=
   * The =/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/osg/voms.opensciencegrid.org.lsc= file

---++ Source

The GOC creates the raw data, mostly manually, then post them online and makes a Pacman package for them. You can see information about the currently releases here:

https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/VOPackageReleases

And raw data here:

http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-package/

For OSG 3.1, we take the raw data and put them into a set of RPMs. The source package is “vo-client”. We do this poorly, but that is the subject for [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-816 a different thread]].

---++ Packaging

[TODO: Add table of each file, its use, Pacman package, and binary RPM.]

---++ History

Alain Roy wrote a Perl script (=osg-make-vomsdir=) to generate LSC data given a vomses file. It contacts each VOMS host directly to get DNs for its host certificate and signing CA. Unfortunately, the script contacted the VOMS host on the Tomcat port (8443) instead of the VOMS server port given in the vomses file, which should be fixed (http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-81).
