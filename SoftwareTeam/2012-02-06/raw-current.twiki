ATLAS has asked for us to support CEMon the the GIP on storage elements. Alain asked if Doug or Neha could work on it, and Doug volunteered. After the meeting, Alain made [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-525][SOFTWARE-525]] to track the work.

---++ New support scheme starts February 14th
As discussed earlier, we are moving to a new support process. Last week, Alain sorted out several technical details with the GOC.

The transition will start next Tuesday. Alain is the first person on triage duty, so I&#39;ll help sort out the details. 

What should you do?

   1. Try out the ITB ticket system. Can you make and process tickets?
   1. Read through the documents below and provide any feedback.
   1. Be patient as we sort through the details and inevitable bumps we&#39;ll run into.
