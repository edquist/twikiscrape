*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Support Update
   * Caltech (Marian) - Awaiting response about upgrade
   * Clemson - Pilots still being &#39;randomly&#39; removed, admin investigating. 
   * Harvard (Marian) - Awaiting holes to be poked in the firewall to test remote job submission
   * FIU - Pilots only running for a few minutes, causing thrashing. Seems to be firewall issues, admin investigating

      * Submitting jobs using !StashCache through !NoVA production system.
   * CE-View (part of HTCondor-CE): got OK from AGIS team, will try to get it in the HTCondor-CE release.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report.
