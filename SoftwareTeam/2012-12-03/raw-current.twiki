---++ Accomplishments

(TODO)

---++ Issues

%RED%Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are resolved/closed when done.%ENDCOLOR%

   * !BeStMan/jGlobus: Tests are still failing, and broader testing is needed.\
   It it uncertain that it will be ready in time for the 3.1.12 release.
   * GUMS: jGlobus dependency (see notes)
   * !XRootD: 3.2.6 has broken GSI on el5; 3.3.0 update delayed until January.\
   Insufficient demand for xrootd on el6 to justify releasing 3.2.6 on el6 only.
   * !GlideinWMS (see notes)
   * osg-configure bug fixes; need to be tested in ITB first.
   * voms-api-java: Currently needed by the bestman2 RPM and some of its dependencies, but Neha thinks that the dependency might be incorrectly declared.\
   Should verify that. 

---+++ Ongoing

   * Upgrade to fetch-crl3 on el5 (for January release?)
   * Pakiti (in testing)
   * SLURM
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * Help debug Texas Tech (Alan Sill et al.), Caltech (Steven Lo), and Oklahoma (Horst)

---+++ Coming Soon(ish)

   * New “Upcoming” repository, initially for HDFS 2.0 (January)
   * HTCondor name change (pending, eventually)
   * CVMFS (for OASIS) (January)
   * HTCondor-CE (February)

---++ Actions

   * Refine December release goals and target date (Tim)
   * !BeStMan: %RED%Resolve test failures%ENDCOLOR% (Neha)

---++ Notes

---+++!! GUMS
Mandatory dependency sorting-out is done; there are extras we can tackle, but depends on time.

GUMS currently depends on the old package cog-jglobus, which is now replaced by jglobus, but bestman depends on gums.
This results in both cog-jglobus and jglobus being installed.
It&#39;s possible to work around this with classpath magic, but a better solution would be to replace the cog-jglobus dependency in GUMS.
That might require modifications in GUMS.
We should run it past John Hover and/or Brian.

---+++!! !GlideInWMS
Version 2.6.2 is in osg-testing.
UCSD has tested the software for a month, but they didn&#39;t install it from the RPM.
The package has two parts: the VO frontend, and the factory;
the frontend gets more use, so it&#39;s more important to test, but both come from the same SRPM.
Therefore, light testing of both RPMs is necessary.
Doug suggests recruiting Derek for the testing.
Suchandra can also test the VO frontend.
ITB testing is not needed (since it would just go to Suchandra anyway).
