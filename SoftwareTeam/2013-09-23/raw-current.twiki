|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Fixed and tested osg-configure for its 3.1.24 release
   * Updated Gratia HTCondor and PBS/LSF probes to filter and log records with crazy run times
   * Built new version of RSV with a contributed change ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1170][SW-1170]])
   * Rebuilt GUMS to use jGlobus 2.0.6; lots of testing before and after
   * Mostly finished and reviewed OSG Next deployment scripts
   * Submitted a Fetch CRL feature request upstream ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1073][SW-1073]])
   * Tested !glideinWMS v3 factory
   * Resolved a very old and complex ticket involving GUMS at MIT; turned out to be a GUMS configuration mistake
   * In osg-test, improved handling of log rotation when tracking a file’s contents for a sentinel and added post-install Java clean-up steps
   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * OSG 3.1.25 tasks
      * Gratia probes ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-118][GR-118]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-119][GR-119]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-122][GR-122]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1207][SW-1207]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1209][SW-1209]]), standard 4 and promotion (Suchandra)
      * GUMS standard 4 and promotion (!BrianL)
      * pbs_status.py for blahp ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1046][SW-1046]]), standard 4 and promotion (Suchandra)
   * OSG Next project: wrap up deployment plan and associated scripts (Carl, !BrianL)
   * OSG 3.2.0: start determining contents (!TimC, !TimT)
   * RSV for VOs (Carl)
   * Deprecate CEMon in favor of osg-info-services; little activity until October (Mat)
   * osg-test improvements: start coding CA creation in osg-test itself (!BrianL)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: scalability testing; set up different run conditions; start a CHTC VM universe troubleshooting guide; make more base OS images (!TimC)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: must document historical design decisions, then turn over to !TimT (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging: must document historical design decisions, then turn over to !TimT (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released, then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)

---+++ Notes

RSV for VOs: Due to other responsibilities, Carl has not made much progress yet. !BrianB has been work on the queries to the information service (!glideinWMS) and the code that actually submits the probes for each VO. Generally, !BrianB will own and track this work, at least for the first phase. At the end of September, he will write some notes on where things are at and where they are going.
