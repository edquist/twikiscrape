%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| April | 3.2.22 / 3.1.46 | 2015-03-30 | 2015-04-06 | 2015-04-14 | Last possible regular release of 3.1 |
| May | 3.2.23 (/ 3.3.0?) | 2015-04-27 | 2015-05-04 | 2015-05-12 | |
| June | 3.2.24 (/ 3.3.1?) | 2015-05-26 | 2015-06-01 | 2014-06-09 | Development Freeze on Tuesday due to Labor Day |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Development Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.
