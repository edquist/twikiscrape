---+ Acceptance testing for: !RSV

---++ Basic background on this component 

Check out [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/ComponentRSV this URL]] for more information on this component. 

---++ How to test a fresh install 

   1. make sure the yum repositories required by OSG is installed on your host 
      * rpm -Uvh http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm OR rpm -Uvh http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm
      * also make sure epel repo is set up. 
   2. install the rpm
      * yum --enablerepo=osg-testing install rsv
   3. edit /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini file
      * in my case, I don&#39;t have a service cert for testing, so I use my own personal cert to create the proxy, but later on the owner of the proxy should be changed to &quot;rsv&quot; user that is created during the rpm install. 
      * in the config file, for the ce_hosts and gridftp_hosts, put in a test server, as the result from this test will be uploaded to OSG GOC, which may mess up your production service monitoring if you chose a production server for the test. 
   4. osg-configure -v
   5. osg-configure -c
   6. /etc/init.d/condor-cron start
   7. /etc/init.d/rsv start
   8. rsv-control --list 
   9. rsv-control --version 
   10. rsv-control --run --all-enabled 
   11. make sure the results from the above commands look fine. 

---++ How to test the upgrade procedure 

   1. make sure to enable the osg-testing repo, and set its priority higher than the other repos
   2. yum --enablerepo=osg-testing upgrade rsv* 
   3. you can use the old 30-rsv.ini file for configuration
   4. repeat steps 4)~11) as mentioned in the last section.
