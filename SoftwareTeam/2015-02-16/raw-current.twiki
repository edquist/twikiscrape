%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| March | 3.2.21 | 2015-02-23 | 2015-03-02 | 2014-03-10 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Development Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussed
   * %HI%Edgar%IH% IPv6 evaluation of OSG software ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1525][SW-1525]])
      * Are we doing enough to test a component (e.g., !XRootD) before telling the world that it is OK?
      * The actual testing mechanisms (ntop, GUI or not, etc.) are really not that critical as long as they are accurate
      * We should use our own testing recipes, which exist for about 10 components today, most with just 1 test case
      * Also, we should contact each developer, if possible, and ask if IPv6 is supported and/or how to test for it
      * If we generate new test cases in this process, they should be added to the test case repository
   * GFAL exploded this weekend
      * We will try to contact the developer and/or packager to see if the issue is known and has a fix coming
      * Check with ATLAS to see how much they even use GFAL yet
      * Probably need to let at least some sites know not to upgrade yet
   * %HI%Marian%IH% !XRootD 4.1
      * Last week: Investigated xrootd-client-compat requirements for eos-client and related update issues ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1788][SW-1788]])
      * Priorities, in order: support all possible OSG updates seamlessly, make xrootd-4.1 “less special” (ideally passthrough), keep remaining solution as simple as possible
      * Marian has lots of work this week, will do what he can, leave notes in ticket, and transition to !TimC
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Update to Globus Toolkit 6 and !MyProxy 6 in OSG 3.2 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1761][SW-1761]])
      * Builds are done and went very smoothly
      * Will need to rebuild all packages before promotion (still need tool support for mass rebuilds, generally)
      * PBS and SEG is broken

---+++ Updated
   * %HI%BrianL%IH% HTCondor CE
      * %HI%Mat%IH% GIP should report HTCondor CE attributes to BDII for ATLAS ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1754][SW-1754]]): need design, proposed fix, and implementation for March

---++ OSG Investigations Team
   * OASIS:
      * Making progress at GOC with OASIS v2; at the least, will result in a new RPM revision in the next week.
      * In the next two weeks, will start looking at overhaul of the oasis-config RPM for automatic updates.
   * Brian working on filing tickets and providing technical advice in getting !StashCache dev projects going.
      * Need to coordinate with !TimC on the OSG Software deliverables once the OSG Annual Report has passed.
      * As part of AAA effort, worked on a new !XrdCl plugin for the POSIX-IO mode.
   * HTCondor CE:
      * Collaborating with adesmet and tlmiller from FW, got mixed-mode services working for HTCondor CE.  Merged for 8.3.4.
      * The OSG use case is fully functional for mixed mode, but likely a bandaid until some major networking overhauls (probably 8.5.x).
      * asked again (now via !CompOps) all USCMS Tier-2s to turn off GRAM to save effort on debugging.
      * need to provide numbers which USLHC VO has how many HTCondor CE in production (and how many GRAM CE to be decommission).
