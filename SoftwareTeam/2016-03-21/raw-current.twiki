---++ OSG Investigations Team
   * OASIS: Working toward a March release that has a number of small cleanups.  Particularly, we&#39;re moving away from the problematic NAS device and upgrading to CVMFS server 2.2.0.
   * 2 weeks ago, had an extensive Gratia planning day at FNAL.  This resulted in plans for a new prototype service based on ElasticSearch + RabbitMQ using the same frontend parts of the collector.  Tanya is working on the writeup.
   * New &quot;secure CVMFS&quot; features have been submitted upstream.  Hope to have these in an April release of CVMFS 2.2.2.
