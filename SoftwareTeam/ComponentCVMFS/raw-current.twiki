---+ OSG Software Component: !CernVM File System (!CernVM-FS or CVMFS)

---++ Purpose

CVMFS is a network file system based on HTTP and optimized to deliver experiment software in a fast, scalable, and reliable way. Files and file metadata are aggressively cached and downloaded on demand. Thereby the !CernVM-FS decouples the life cycle management of the application software releases from the operating system. !CernVM-FS is included in !CernVM, however it can also be used outside !CernVM.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

The [[http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem][CernVM project]].

---++ Packaging

   * The primary top-level package is =osg-oasis=, which *requires* specific versions of the =cvmfs= and =cvmfs-config-osg= packages (Dave Dykstra knows why).
   * In turn, the =cvmfs-config-osg= package *provides* =cvmfs-config=, =cvmfs-keys=, and =oasis-config= (among other things).
   * Some other packages, tests, etc. depend on =cvmfs=, =cvmfs-keys=, and =oasis-config=.
