---+ OSG Software Component: !GlideTester


---++ Purpose

This package can be thought as a &quot;specialized&quot; [[ComponentGlideinWMSVOFrontend][Glidein Frontend]]. It is used to perform scalability measurements of web faced services at exact concurrency points (parallel running clients).
 

---++ Usage

Typical usage is to install the glideTester and HTCondor Schedd on same node and &quot;connect&quot; it to an HTCondor Collector/Negotiator. And connect it to a glideIn Factory. Although not required it makes a best use of resources when is used on a sleeper pool.

Detailed instructions on how to install it can be found here:

---++ Source

The source code can be found in sourceforge:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/osgscal/code/load_generators/glideTester/trunk glideTester&lt;/pre&gt;

And it is currently owned and maintained by Edgar Fajardo in the trunk of sourceforge svn repo.


---++ Packaging

Not yet packaged &amp;ndash; always installed from the tarball or directly from the svn trunk.

---++ History

GlideTester was originally written by Igor Sfiligoi in 2009. It was designed based on the code of the GlideinWMS tester in order to test the scalability of a storage element.

During Summer/Spring 2014 was used on the efforts to test the scalability of the AAA system by Carl Volsualo and Edgar Fajardo.
