*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
   * Today’s release: Everything is looking good, but some automated tests are still running. Nothing for Software at this time.
   * Problem with automated testing to think about: How do we detect when tests are skipped that we (as smart humans) think we are running?
   * New idea for documentation: We have many ways to get and update CA certificates (and friends) – maybe too many. We could write a guide that explains options and their consequences, and maybe makes suggestions.

---+++ Major Activities
   * Fix routine automated test failures ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1996][SW-1996]])
   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])
   * Documentation
   * !StashCache ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1815][SW-1815]])
   * HTCondor CE ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1813][SW-1813]])
   * IPv6 evaluation ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1525][SW-1525]])
   * Support, especially Clemson, Florida International (FIU), Georgia Tech
