---+ Globus Patches

We have many patches for Globus packages, and we would like to push most of them upstream. [[http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-455][GT-455]] is the master ticket on Globus&#39;s JIRA for this.
The patches have been checked against globus_5_2_branch in CVS, retrieved 2013-10-08 (which is what will be 5.2.5).
