---+++ Discussion

---++ OSG Investigations Team
   * OASIS: Working toward a March release that has a number of small cleanups.  Particularly, we&#39;re moving away from the problematic NAS device and upgrading to CVMFS server 2.2.0.
   * Still figuring out internals of new Gratia v2.  Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.  
   * New &quot;secure CVMFS&quot; features have been submitted upstream and accepted.  They will be part of new 2.3.0 release, coming soon.  Github Pull Request [[https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/pull/1497][#1497]]
   * HTCondor-CE-Bosco release is moving forward to release with 3.3.12, despite HTCondor release hurdles.  With HTCondor release today, testing is required for all of the components.  Tickets: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2187][2187]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2188][2188]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][2257]]
   * Gratia support for HTCondor-CE-Bosco done.  Gratia patch has been made ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][ticket]]), reviewed, and accepted.  Also, will need to modify osg-configure for new gratia, which is also done: [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-configure/pull/8][#8]].  With the new HTCondor release, we need to test the gratia probe again.
   * CI (Continuous Integration)  support has been added to a few package such as the HTCondor-CE and tarball-client.  This includes running the full osg-test with the newly committed change.  We may add CI support to more packages in the future.
      * tarball-client is a great example to build from, see tests/ directory and .travis.yml for configuration. https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tarball-client
