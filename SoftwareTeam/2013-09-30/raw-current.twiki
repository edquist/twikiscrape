%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.25 | 2013-09-23 | 2013-09-30 | 2013-10-08 | jGlobus 2.0.6, !GlideinWMS 2.7.2, gratia-probe |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Finished testing !glideinWMS version 3
   * Closed out the Software/Release SHA-2 project
   * Wrote verification scripts for the OSG Next deployment on 1 October
   * Prepared, tested, and promoted a new GUMS build with a small bug fix
   * Added CA and certificate creation code to osg-test itself
   * Refactored other osg-test certificate code into the new certificate library
   * Scripted the process to generate a set of test runs for VM universe
   * Fixed remaining osg-test bugs that the new test runs uncovered

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * pbs_status.py for blahp ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1046][SW-1046]]): still working on testing (Suchandra)
   * OSG Next project: ITB deployment tomorrow, more deployments on the 8th and 22nd (Carl, !BrianL)
   * OSG 3.2.0: start determining contents (!TimC, !TimT)
   * RSV for VOs (Carl)
   * Deprecate CEMon in favor of osg-info-services; little activity until October (Mat)
   * osg-test improvements: start integrating CA creation into existing tests (!BrianL)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: more run conditions; start a CHTC VM universe troubleshooting guide (!TimC)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: must document historical design decisions, then turn over to !TimT (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging: must document historical design decisions, then turn over to !TimT (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released, then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)

---+++ Notes

*HTCondor-CE for PBS:* This feature is not working yet. Jobs run, but the output is not returned back to the user, so there is still work to be done. It, and the related pbs_status.py for blahp ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1046][SW-1046]]), will be removed from the 3.1.25 list.

*RSV for VOs:* The new sleep probe is done.
