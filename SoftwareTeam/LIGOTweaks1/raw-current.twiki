In late March, 2011, I spent 3 hours on Globus Toolkit, and 1 hour on !MyProxy, at least as far as getting the Debian changes into the Testing repository. There was a little extra time to get LIGO to test the packages, and do the final push to production (and quickie test) — maybe another 0.5–1.0 hours.
