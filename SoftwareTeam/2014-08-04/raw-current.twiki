*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * !AutoPyFactory: Fixes for GLOW including a workaround for a condor_q bug (Jose).
   * !HTCondor-CE:
      * Caltech issues resolved - non-standard HTCondor setup, will work to get osg-configure to &quot;auto detect&quot; this.  Testing in the ITB factory.
      * Fix available for propagating $HOME to jobs; osg-configure will provide $PATH.
   * !HTCondor: Benchmarking !HTCondor 8.3.0 RC (Igor).
   * !OASIS 2.0: Working on packaging and refinements (Jose).

   * Cut new version of RSV with fixes for HTCondor CE and Gratia; built, tested, and promoted ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1556][SW-1556]])
   * Investigated !XRootD 4 packaging issues and settled on an implementation plan; delayed release until September ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1448][SW-1448]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1561][SW-1561]])
