---++ State of GT 5.2 update

Mat has rebuilt all of GT 5.2. It&#39;s not yet in osg-development. Working on packages on packages that depend on Globus 5.2, then it can go into osg-development. Most packages should be a bump and resubmit, so most should be done in a day. 

---++ State of CA certificates

Ready for testing. We have several packages that depend on &quot;grid-certificates&quot;, and we have several RPMs that provide &quot;grid-certificates&quot;, so that people have their choice in how to install them. As of today,
these choices are:

   * igtf-ca-certs
   * igft-ca-certs-compat
   * osg-ca-certs
   * osg-ca-certs-compat
   * osg-ca-scripts
   * no-ca-certs

The no-ca-certs RPM fulfills the grid-certificates requirement but does not provide any CA certs. This is for an admin who wants to handle it themselves. It may be commonly used for worker nodes.

---++ Moving things from dev to testing

Once GT 5.2 is ready, Alain wants to sit down with someone (Mat? Tim?) to go through the contents of the osg-testing and osg-development repos and promote packages as appropriate.

---++ Status reports

   * *Alain*: Management, no-ca-certs. Will be at Bestman Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   * *Jeff*: HDFS 0.20 was released this morning. Migration still needs two things: osg-specific configuration (should be pretty simple, can get it done this week), and !GridFTP HDFS plugin. Should solve other issues. Not suer how hard it is to move it over. The package was developed by Brian. Needs to compare lcmaps configuration to see what we need. Will know more by the end of the week. 
   * *Mat*: See Globus 5.2 above.
   * *Scot*: Spent a lot of last week to finish up packaging condor-cron. Next step is to test osg-rsv in osg-testing. ca-certificates probe is not working and can&#39;t use current Condor RPM. 
   * *Tim*: Tim is writing documentation on our testing infrastructure. We have a basic infrastructure with all of bits needed to do basic testing of installing and grid-proxy-init. It&#39;s in good shape. Should be done today. People should be aware that running the tests are dangerous--it will install and remove software. Be careful! Tim and Scot talked about runnig tests more safely as non-root.
