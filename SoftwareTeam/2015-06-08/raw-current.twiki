%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| July | 3.2.25 | 2015-06-29 | 2015-07-06 | 2015-07-14 | 5 week cycle  |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussed

   * !BeStMan workaround to use !GridFTP: not for June release; the correct changes are understood, but it is too late to make them now

   * !BrianL explained about the messy automated test results:
      * EL&amp;nbsp;5 is broken as it has been
      * New srm-ifce problems on EL&amp;nbsp;5, caused by an EPEL update over the weekend
      * EL&amp;nbsp;7 still not working for a variety of reasons
      * !BrianL will restore RHEL scenarios

   * RSV !XRootD probes for !StashCache: for now, just focus on the xrdcp stuff
