*Tim Theisen* started as the CHTC Release Manager in Madison today. More news soon on what this change will mean to the OSG Software team.

*Triage Duty:* Neha this week, Suchandra next week; %RED%23 open tickets%ENDCOLOR%. We really need to work on tickets this week!!!

*OSG Deployments:*
| OSG 3.x | 74 (+5) sites | 14 (+2) using 3.1.16 |
| OSG 1.2 | 33 (+0) sites | 1 (+0) using 1.2.32 |

*HTCondor Week* is this week, so about half of the Software team will be busy and slow to respond all week.

---++ Accomplishments

   * Ongoing ITB testing for release 3.1.17
   * Fixed an SGE configuration issue in osg-configure
   * Fixed new xrootd dependencies, again
   * Finished internal testing of Java components running under (only) !OpenJDK 7
   * Added new xrootd-voms-plugin package; needs testing

---++ OSG Software Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state.

   * Release 3.1.17 tomorrow: client tarballs, !XRootD 3.3, !GSI-OpenSSH 5.6, VOMS client, &amp;hellip;
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7
   * SLURM
   * HDFS 2

---++ HTCondor Projects

   * HTCondor-CE: Need to determine packaging tasks
   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: Being defined
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging

---++ Coming Soon

   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * HTCondor name change (pending, eventually)
   * BOSCO (soon-ish, comes along with HTCondor 7.9)

---++ Notes

*OSG 3 Deployments:* At this time, the GOC is creating an individual ticket for each OSG 1.2 site. Sites are to report on upgrade plans, barriers to upgrading, timelines, etc.

*Release 3.1.17:* Tomorrow; Mat will cut the release. Everything is ready, but two items were dropped late. !GlideinWMS has package dependency issues and must be reorganized and retested. And !BrianB’s !jGlobus patch did not go into testing as expected, and hence is not ready for release now; but, the unpatched !jGlobus 2.0.5 will go into production, because that was a separate item. The client tarballs will ship, but we are still sorting out how they will be posted onto the GOC website. The ATLAS request for specific additions to the clients are still in discussion and will not delay the release of the current tarballs.

*osg-configure:* In addition to the LSF Gratia probe fix, there was also an SGE fix — Suchandra will document the latter in a JIRA ticket, so we can track it.

*Java 6 Migration:* Final internal testing of Java-based components using only !OpenJDK 7 is complete, thanks to the hard work of Neha and Carl. Neha found one GUMS problem, which ultimately turned out to be a pre-existing issue with GUMS not caused by Java 7. All of the new Java packages will be promoted to osg-upcoming-testing soon, which is a big milestone. Neha and Carl will work to create the list of packages to promote to testing.

*HDFS 2:* Needs to be rebuilt with Java 7.
