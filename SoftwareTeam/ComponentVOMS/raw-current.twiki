---+ OSG Software Component: VOMS

---++ Purpose

VOMS is a system for managing authorization data within multi-institutional collaborations, also called Virtual Organizations (VOs). VOMS provides a database of user roles and capabilities, and a set of tools for accessing and manipulating the database and using the database contents to generate grid credentials for users when needed. The credentials are in the form of signed certificates included in a grid proxy certificate and are made with =voms-proxy-init=.

The VOMS component itself consists of a long-running service and command-line client tools, both written in C++. [[ComponentVOMSAdmin][VOMS Admin]] is a separate component that provides a web interface to manage the data in the VOMS service.

---++ Usage

Some VOs run their own VOMS servers, but OSG and Fermilab run a few VOMS servers on behalf of smaller VOs. You can see the list of VOMS servers because we ship this list: In an install of =osg-client=, just look in =/etc/vomses=. This file comes from the =vo-client= package.
