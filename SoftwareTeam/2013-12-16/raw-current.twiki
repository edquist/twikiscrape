%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.28 / 3.2.2 | | 2013-12-12 | 2013-12-17 | Emergency Release |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * !OpenSSL/GSI fire: support acceptance testing, as needed (Mat, all)
   * Update Globus Toolkit: review spec file changes, work toward promotion to testing (Mat)
   * Move gridftp-hdfs to Globus: part of GT update in general (Mat; [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1214][SW-1214]])
   * HTCondor 8.0.5: should be easy, but this is Edgar’s first time touching HTCondor, so he will ask for help if needed (Edgar)
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: define project and implement stop-gap measures for Koji (!TimC, Mat)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: Jaime Frey found an HTCondor configuration problem; still testing and investigating (Suchandra)
   * Improve empty packages: Work toward promotion to testing (Carl)
   * Automated testing: Finish automated creation of HTML pages (!BrianL); automate transfer of HTML pages to AFS (Mat); add ability to do trunk tests (!TimC)
   * Support HCC and US-ATLAS in Koji: just need HCC signing key to finish their configuration (Mat)
   * UW ITB site: settle on an initial architecture, define tasks for Infrastructure (Mat, et al.)

---+++ Work Upcoming

---+++ Notes

*Triage:* If there are tickets about the !OpenSSL/GSI problem, we should let users know that a fix is planned for tomorrow.

*Globus:* !BrianB had the suggestion to release GT 5.2.5 in OSG 3.2 first, then (assuming things go well) in OSG 3.1 the following planned release, i.e., a month later. If things go well, Mat will have the packages in testing yet this week, and so we can aim for a February release in OSG 3.2.

*HTCondor-CE:* Suchandra and Jaime are making progress, but Suchandra will be stalled for a couple days due to major networking changes that are affecting his site.
