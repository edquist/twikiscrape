---+ OSG Software Component: !GridFTP

---++ Purpose

!GridFTP is a file-transfer protocol and set of tools implementing the protocol. While based on FTP, it is enhanced to high-performance, secure, and reliable, optimized for high-bandwidth wide-area networks. It uses the same authentication mechanisms as [[ComponentGRAM][GRAM]], so see that page for details.

On a Compute Element (CE), !GridFTP is used primarily to stage applications to =OSG_APP= (a shared filesystem mounted on the CE and the worker nodes) or to stage large datasets (also a shared filesystem mounted on the CE and the worker nodes).

---++ Usage

[TODO: Find a sample or two online or from =osg-test=.]

---++ Source

The Globus gatekeeper and jobmanager (GRAM for short) are provided by the [[http://www.globus.org/ Globus Team]].

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* EPEL and OSG. We pass-through packages, as needed, for patches and so forth.

---++ History

---++ Future

!GridFTP is very stable and works well. We have no particular concerns about it. Because it is used by Globus Online (a funded service run by the Globus Project), it is likely to have a long-term future.
