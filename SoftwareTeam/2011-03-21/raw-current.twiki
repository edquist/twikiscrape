---++ Individual Updates

Tanya: Good vacation last week. Catching up. Pre-occupied by bulk-transfer for various VOs. (LSST et. al.) Getting up to speed on Xrootd RPMs. Upgrading test machines to SL5. Alain is curious about bulk transfers and will followup with Tanya on Wednesday.

Doug: Fixed RSV probe that had SRM_CONFIG environment variable problem. Working on public storage, particularly helping people use Gratia to provide information about allocations. Alain is curious and will follow up on Wednesday. Working on getting Xrootd RPM built, currently getting environment set up. Talked with Tim about Xrootd earlier today. 

Neha: Improving testsuite. Not a lot of work to complete it, but limited time. It could be done in a week if she just worked on it, but realistically it may be done in a month. Updating VDT dCache to version 1.9.5-24.

Alex: Bestman packaging from source. Updated to Bestman 2 update (2.0.7), requested by ATLAS, not necessary to immediately update for VDT. UFL problem with config file: bug fixed. Will chat with Alain re: source packaging on Tuesday.

Tim: This week &amp; next are very heavy (50-75%) with OSG Summer School. Helping with Xrootd RPM--working on handoff to Doug and sorting through a few details with the developers, like separate DSI package. Need to settle requirements for Xrootd RPM. Goal: runs out of the box. Also working with Mat on worker node client. 

Mat: Focusing on worker node. Pretty close to done. Writing up some install instructions. Can tell Dan it is ready for testing this week.

Scot: New test RSV release on Thursday. Still having RSV timeouts, unclear why. Building Bestman 2, version 2.0.6.

Alain: Focused mostly on management things: effort tracking, native packaging, and more. Also doing some work on CREAM with Suchandra.
