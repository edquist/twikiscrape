*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Notes


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * OASIS:
      * New version goes out to ITB tomorrow (primary feature: ability to replicate any repository and still follow OSG-Security constraints).  Assuming successful production deploy, we will need to do a new client config RPM in November.
   * StashCache:
      * StashCache tester continues to gather good performance data.
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.
      * Making progress in puppetizing GOC configuration.
   * CEMon (part of HTCondor-CE): 
      * Got first round of requests for improvements from AGIS.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report
