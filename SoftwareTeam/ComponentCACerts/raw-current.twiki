---+ OSG Software Component: CA Certificates

---++ Purpose

Certificate Authority (CA) certificates are required to complete the chain of trust for X.509 certificates that we use for authentication and authorization throughout the OSG. They are not a software component _per se_, but they are distributed somewhat like software, and there are some related software components for managing a CA certificate installation.

---++ Usage

CA certificates are typically installed into =/etc/grid-security/certificates=, although that can be changed by a site administrator under certain circumstances.

---++ Source

Most of our CA certificates come from a broadly accepted distribution from the [[http://www.igtf.net International Grid Trust Federation]] (IGTF).

---++ Packaging

We distribute CA certificates in several ways.

---+++ OSG 1.2 (Pacman)

The OSG Software team provides the =vdt-update-certs= package. It can download one of two tarballs, one of which is maintained by the security team, one by us. For the Pacman package that we continue to maintain, there are [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/internal/igtf-updates.html][instructions for creating the package and releasing it]].

---+++ OSG 3 (RPM)

The OSG Software team provides the =osg-update-certs= package. It can download four different tarballs (OSG or IGTF, and old-style (!OpenSSL 0.9) or new-style (!OpenSSL 1.0 + !OpenSSL 0.9)), all of which the OSG Security team maintains. Users of this package can configure their system to update CA certificates automatically.

Corresponding to the four tarballs are four RPMs in our repositories. We ship the CA certificate RPMs as part of a regular, versioned OSG Software release; that is, we increase the OSG 3 release number even if the release contains only the CA certificates. The OSG Security team [[Security.CreatingCADistributions][actually produces the RPMs]] and places them into the =osg-development= and =osg-testing= repositories. Then, we do the release steps. For new CA certificate distributions, the Security team likes to have a one-week long ITB testing period, which begins when the RPMs are promoted to =osg-testing=.

---++ History

Alain thought about having a separate repository for the CA certificates, so they could be updated independently, but never pursued it.

---++ Future

We need some sort of auto-update mechanism for sites that use the RPMs.
