---+ Contributed Puppet Modules Repository (puppet-contrib)

The puppet-contrib repository is a Git repository of Puppet modules contributed
by the OSG community that other OSG sites will find useful. Note that these
modules are not official, and OSG-Software will not provide support for them.

The repository is located on Github at [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/puppet-contrib][opensciencegrid/puppet-contrib]].
Any member of the OSG will can contribute modules by making a pull request.
The OSG-Software team will review and approve pull requests.

Each contributor should create their own top-level directories in the repo.
They should name their directories after their Github accounts (e.g.
matyasselmeci).  If they are contributing modules on behalf of an organization
(a VO, experiment or site), they should name the top-level directory after the
organization instead (e.g. CMS).  Contributors are free to organize their
directories however they want, though something similar to the standard Puppet
layout is recommended.  We also suggest making a &#39;scripts/&#39; subdirectory for
contributors to store utility scripts that sites will find useful.

Here is an example of what the repository should look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
/matyasselmeci/
+----- modules/
|        +------ osg-release/
|        |         +---------- manifests/
|        |         +---------- files/
|        |         +---------- templates/
|        |         ...
|        +------ koji-builder/
|        ...
+----- scripts/
         +------ updater.sh
         ...
/osg-cat/
+----- modules/
         +------ ntp/
                   +---------- manifests/
                   ...
         ...
/CMS/
+----- modules/
|        +------ condor/
|                  +---------- manifests/
|                  ...
|        ...
+----- scripts/
         ...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since this is a contrib area, the only hard rules are:

   * Contributed modules must be legal to distribute.
   * Contributed modules must not be malicious.
   * Contributed modules must not include large binary files.

However, the following guidelines should be kept in mind to maximize the
number of sites a module would be useful to:

   * The majority of sites will be running EL 5 or EL 6. \
     Contributors are encouraged to test that their modules work on those distributions.
   * In particular, since the EPEL repositories ship Puppet 2.7 and Facter 1.6, those are the versions that sites are most likely to have. \
     Contributors are encouraged to test that their modules work with those versions. \
     Modules that work with both Puppet 2 and Puppet 3 will be useful to the widest audience.
   * The more general the module, the more use people can make out of it, even if they are not part of a specific organization. \
     If a module is organization-specific, it should go into the top-level directory of that organization.
   * A README file with the following information would be very helpful for people choosing modules to use:
      * A description of the module
      * Name and contact info of the author / owner
      * Requirements
      * Known bugs / gotchas
   * Following the official Puppet style guide from http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html will make it easier for people to understand the module and contribute back.

Finally, we strongly encourage that if a contributors want to make changes to
someone else&#39;s module, then they should get that module&#39;s maintainer to sign
off on the changes first.
