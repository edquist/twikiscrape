---+ OSG Software Component: RSV

---++ Purpose

RSV tests a site to see if it is working and shares the results with a central server at the GOC so everyone can see. It primarily tests fork jobs, basic data transfers, and a few CE characteristics like “are the CA certificates up to date?” It might sound similar to [[ComponentCEMon][CEMon]]/[[ComponentGIP][GIP]], so you can think of it this way:

   * !CEMon/GIP publishes information about what functionality a site claims to be offering
   * RSV publishes information about whether or not a site is actually functioning correctly

RSV tends to be the public face of failures. That is, people will say “RSV is failing, why?” and the answer is that RSV is correctly reporting the existence of a problem. So helping people on a ticket about an RSV problem is sort of the “OSG-complete” problem: An RSV ticket could require knowledge about [[ComponentGRAM][GRAM]] or [[ComponentGridFTP][GridFTP]] or CA certificate distribution or GUMS or …

One confusing thing: RSV uploads its test results using the same protocol as [[ComponentGratia][Gratia]]. In fact, there is a “Gratia metric probe” that uploads the data. (The word “metric” comes from the fact that a single RSV test is called an “RSV metric”.) To confuse the issue, RSV can do some basic tests that Gratia is working, so there is an “RSV Gratia metric”, but sometimes people call it a “probe”.

---++ Usage

We used to run RSV directly on the CE, but these days it is just as easy to install it on a separate computer. That might be slightly more realistic of a test than running on the CE.

---++ Source

The OSG Software Team owns RSV. It was maintained by Scot but is now maintained by Mat. The code is in pretty good shape and there are no major known problems with RSV, except perhaps that it’s a bit of a pain to configure. (But easier than it used to be!) 

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

The (unreleased?) =info-service-probe= was originally written by Brian Bockelman.
It was written for an older version of the probe API and hasn&#39;t been converted to the current version yet.
Since then, probe design has been simplified.
