---+ Using VDT Native Packages

---++ Overview


The VDT has been putting together native packages (currently RPMs) for some of
the software distributed in the Pacman packages for VDT 2.0.0.  The current
packages include:

   * glexec
   * globus (4.0.8)
   * xrootd

Also, packages that make up the OSG worker node client are available:

   * dccp
   * edg-gridftp-client
   * fetch-crl
   * glite-data-delegation-client
   * glite-fts-client
   * lcg-utils
   * lfc-client
   * myproxy-client
   * pegasus-worker
   * srm-client-fermi
   * srm-client-lbnl
   * uberftp
   * voms-client

These packages are set up similar to our Pacman packages in that they install
into =/opt/vdt=, are binary-only (i.e., there are no source RPMs) and you need
to set up your environment before using them. They are a work in progress and
we greatly appreciate any feedback.

For those who like to browse, here are direct links to the files in our repositories:
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/native/rpm/testing/rh5][testing]]
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/native/rpm/testing/rh5][development]]
Packages in the development repository are more new, though less stable than
packages in the testing repository.  These are only pre-release packages, so we
don&#39;t have a production repository available yet.

---++ Installation


---+++ Requirements

To use these packages you must have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or compatible
installation (e.g., !CentOS 5 or Scientific Linux 5).  We have both 32- and
64-bit packages available.

You should not have EPEL repositories enabled while using these packages,
since they provide conflicting packages for some of the grid software we
distribute (e.g., the Globus Toolkit).


---+++ Enabling the Repository

As root, do the following:

   1. Install the VDT repository metadata package:&lt;br/&gt; =rpm -Uvh $VDTWWW/native/rpm/repo/vdt-testing-1-1.noarch.rpm= for the testing repository, or =rpm -Uvh $VDTWWW/native/rpm/repo/vdt-development-1-1.noarch.rpm= for the development repository.
   1. If they are installed, disable EPEL repositories. Note: DAG and RPMforge repositories do not conflict and may be left enabled.
   1. Install VDT RPMs&lt;super&gt;*&lt;/super&gt;:&lt;br/&gt; =yum install &lt;em&gt;PACKAGENAME&lt;/em&gt;=
   1. If not already done, [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html#rpm][install CA certificates]].

&lt;super&gt;*&lt;/super&gt;We have a metapackage named =osg-worker-node-client= which will
bring in all of the necessary packages for a worker node client install. To
use, type:&lt;br/&gt; =yum install osg-worker-node-client=


*Note:* In general, all installed files will be placed into the =/opt/vdt=
tree.


To run most grid software, you must have CA certificates installed.  VDT RPMs
that require CA certificates expect those certificates to be installed in
=/etc/grid-security/certificates=.



---++ Usage

Before using any of the worker node client tools, you must set the
appropriate environment variables. In the shell you plan to run the tools in,
you must source the setup.sh file by running:&lt;br/&gt;
=. /opt/vdt/setup.sh=
after you log in. If you are running one of the tools as part of a script or
a cron job, you must make sure that the script sources =setup.sh= before
executing any of the tools.



---++ Uninstallation

To remove a specific package, type:
=yum erase &lt;em&gt;PACKAGENAME&lt;/em&gt;=

Yum will remove the package and any packages that depend on it.  Note:
Removing a metapackage such as =globus-client= or
=osg-worker-node-client= will not actually uninstall any software,
as the metapackages are just empty packages which have the real software listed
as dependencies.  You must remove the individual software you wish to
uninstall.

As a shortcut, we placed most of the osg-worker-node-client packages into a
yum group, meaning that you can run:&lt;br/&gt;
=yum groupremove osg-worker-node-client= &lt;br/&gt;
to uninstall most of the worker node client.  Not all packages will be
uninstalled, since we have no way of knowing the difference between packages
installed manually and packages brought in as dependencies, and some packages
such as =fetch-crl= or =voms-client= are used in more
than just the worker node client.

To completely uninstall all VDT RPMs, type:&lt;br/&gt;
=rpm -e `rpm -qg Applications/Grid`=



---++ Notes


---+++ Conflicts

Do not use these packages in conjunction with:


   * EPEL grid packages, especially EPEL Globus packages
   * VDT Pacman installations placed in =/opt/vdt=
   * VDT Globus 5-based RPMs customized for LIGO


---+++ Other

These packages are a work in progress. They&#39;ve only been minimally tested
and should not be used in production sites. We&#39;d greatly appreciate feedback,
especially on the following topics:

   * Do the packages function the way you expect them to?
   * Can you use the packages in a small test environment?  Can you connect to a remote server, transfer files, and run jobs?
   * Is the default configuration provided appropriate for your needs?
   * What kinds of problems have you run into while using the packages?
   * What changes do you need before you&#39;re willing the use the packages in production?
