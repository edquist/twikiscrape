---+ How to Restore Koji

This document contains recipes on how to restore the Koji services and the database they require.
It is divided into two sections:
one for the database (to be done if something happens to _db-01_),
and one for the server hosting the koji services (to be done if something happens to _koji.chtc_).

In case both the database and the hub need to be restored, the database should be restored first.

---++ Background information

Backups of _koji.chtc.wisc.edu_ and _db-01.batlab.org_ are on _host-3.chtc.wisc.edu_ in &lt;code&gt;/export/backup/&lt;em&gt;$DATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
That machine is in WID. (Same room as _koji.chtc_ itself, which is why we have offsite backups).
It&#39;s a homebrew rsync-based backup system. (Not our home -- Nate told me it was written for Midwest Tier 2).
They go back up to a week, with a monthly snapshot for a year.

---++ Setting up your environment

For all of these steps, you will need a root shell on _host-3.chtc.wisc.edu_
and have the following environment variables defined:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
NEWDB=&lt;em&gt;FQDN of new database server&lt;/em&gt;
NEWKOJI=&lt;em&gt;FQDN of new koji host&lt;/em&gt;
DATE=&lt;em&gt;YYYY-MM-DD date of most recent good backup&lt;/em&gt;
DBBACKUP=/export/backup/$DATE/db-01.batlab.org
KOJIBACKUP=/export/backup/$DATE/koji.chtc.wisc.edu
RSYNC=&quot;rsync --archive --hard-links --verbose&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ I. Restoring the database

The entire filesystem of _db-01_ is backed up -- this includes all of
=/var/lib/pgsql=, including the database as-is.  In theory, this means that we
could just rsync all the files to a blank hard drive, boot up, and we&#39;d have a
_db-01_ again.  However, the Postgres manual warns against restoring the
database from a filesystem backup that was made while the database was live,
and we do not shut down the database before backups.

We might be able to restore every other part of the filesystem besides the
database, which would speed up the overall restoration process, but only the
fresh install was tested.

The new database server is called _newdb_ in these instructions.


---+++ I.1. Restoring Services

Prerequisites for _newdb_: an EL 6+ host with an SSH server set up and accessible (as root) from _host-3.chtc.wisc.edu_

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
## On newdb:
## Install postgres, get a blank DB up and create the user that koji
## will be using.
root@newdb# yum install -y postgresql-server
root@newdb# service postgresql initdb
root@newdb# useradd -r -m koji
## Make a directory we&#39;ll put the restored files into.
root@newdb# mkdir -p /root/dbrestore

## On host-3:
you@host-3$ sudo $RSYNC $DBBACKUP/homefs/  $NEWDB:/root/dbrestore/home
you@host-3$ for dir in root etc var; do \
   sudo $RSYNC $DBBACKUP/rootfs/$dir/ \
      $NEWDB:/root/dbrestore/$dir \
   done
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Continue on to the next section

---+++ I.2. Restoring Database Contents

Assumes you have restored the /var directory from backup into =/root/dbrestore/var=.
   1. Restore the postgres config files so the koji-hub daemon can log in.&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
## On newdb:
root@newdb# service postgresql stop
root@newdb# cp -a /root/dbrestore/var/lib/pgsql/data/{*.conf,postmaster.opts} \
   /var/lib/pgsql/data/
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Edit =/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf=. There are lines like: &lt;pre&gt;
# Koji-hub IPv4:
host    koji        koji        128.104.100.41/32     md5&lt;/pre&gt;\
      Change the IP address to the public IP address of the host that will serve as the new hub.
   1. Restore the actual database:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
## On newdb:
root@newdb# chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql/*
root@newdb# service postgresql start
root@newdb# gunzip -c /root/dbrestore/var/lib/pgsql-backup/postgres-db-01.sql.gz | psql -U postgres postgres
## (Ignore the error &#39;role &quot;postgres&quot; already exists&#39; if you see it)
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ I.3. Validation

Do the following tests to make sure the database is ready to use:

   1. Test that the contents got properly restored:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newdb# psql -U koji koji
koji=&amp;gt; select * from users;
koji=&amp;gt; select * from build order by id desc limit 10;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Test logging in as the koji user:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newdb# psql -U koji -h newdb koji
&lt;/pre&gt;\
      (you must use the FQDN of _newdb_, not _localhost_).\
      Be sure you get prompted for a password, and the password from =/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf= works.
   1. Go to [[#RestoringKoji][Restoring koji]] if needed; otherwise go to [[#PostRestore][Post-restore steps]]

#RestoringKoji
---++ II. Restoring koji

Both the root filesystem of _koji.chtc_ and =/mnt/koji= are backed up.
The root filesystem backups are in the =rootfs= subdirectory of =/export/backup/$DATE/koji.chtc.wisc.edu=
and the backups of =/mnt/koji= are in the =kojifs= subdirectory.

The following instructions show how to restore the critical components of
Koji onto a new machine.

In the instructions, the new host will be named _newkoji_.

---+++ II.1. Installing the OS

Prerequisites for _newkoji_: an EL 6+ host with an SSH server set up and accessible (as root) from _host-3.chtc.wisc.edu_
(This recipe was tested for EL 6, on the same machine as _newdb_).
   1. Install !EPEL and OSG repos.
      &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# rpm -Uvh \
   http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm \
   http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el6-release-latest.rpm
root@newkoji# yum install -y yum-plugin-priorities&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Edit =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-*development.repo=:
      * Enable the development repo
      * Add &lt;code&gt;includepkg=koji*&lt;/code&gt; to the definition for the development repo
   1. Go through the other repo files and make sure that !EPEL and OS priorities are worse than 98.\
      Especially look at =cobbler-config.repo= if it exists.
   1. Install the koji packages and dependencies, making sure the koji packages themselves come from osg:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# yum install koji koji-builder koji-hub koji-plugin-sign \
   koji-theme-fedora koji-utils koji-web mod_ssl postgresql
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Mount =/mnt/koji= if necessary
   1. Restore the contents of the koji filesystem. On _host-3_:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
## At a minimum, you must restore the /mnt/koji/packages directory
you@host-3$ sudo $RSYNC $KOJIBACKUP/kojifs/packages/ $NEWKOJI:/mnt/koji/packages
## The other directories are optional, though it saves a lot of time to restore /mnt/koji/repos
you@host-3$ sudo $RSYNC $KOJIBACKUP/kojifs/repos/ $NEWKOJI:/mnt/koji/repos
you@host-3$ sudo $RSYNC $KOJIBACKUP/kojifs/work/ $NEWKOJI:/mnt/koji/work
you@host-3$ sudo $RSYNC $KOJIBACKUP/kojifs/scratch/ $NEWKOJI:/mnt/koji/scratch
## Any dirs you did not restore should be created.
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Fix permissions if needed. On _newkoji_:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# chown -R apache:apache /mnt/koji/{packages,repos,work,scratch}
root@newkoji# chmod 0755             /mnt/koji/{packages,repos,work,scratch}
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Continue on to the next section

---+++ II.2. Restoring Configuration

On _newkoji_, define the shell function =dirclone=, listed below:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
dirclone () {
   srcdir=$(dirname &quot;$1&quot;)/$(basename &quot;$1&quot;)
   destdir=$(dirname &quot;$2&quot;)/$(basename &quot;$2&quot;)
   mkdir -p &quot;$(dirname &quot;$2&quot;)&quot;
   rsync --archive --delete-after --acls --xattrs --partial --partial-dir=.rsync-partial &quot;$srcdir/&quot; &quot;$destdir&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

   1. On _newkoji_:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;mkdir -p /root/hubrestore&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. On _host-3_:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
sudo $RSYNC $KOJIBACKUP/rootfs/{root,home,etc} $NEWKOJI:/root/hubrestore/
sudo $RSYNC $KOJIBACKUP/varfs/ $NEWKOJI:/root/hubrestore/var&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. On _newkoji_, install some utils we will need later:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# yum install -y dos2unix vim-enhanced&lt;/pre&gt; (vim-enhanced is used for vimdiff)
   1. On _newkoji_:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
## Restore some of the directories in /etc:
root@newkoji# while read subtree; do
   dirclone /root/hubrestore/etc/$subtree /etc/$subtree
done &amp;lt;&amp;lt;__END__
httpd
kojid
koji-hub
kojira
koji-sign-plugin
kojiweb
mock
pki/tls/certs
pki/tls/private
__END__
## Restore some of the files:
root@newkoji# cp -a /root/hubrestore/etc/koji.conf /etc/
root@newkoji# cp -a /root/hubrestore/etc/sysconfig/{httpd,kojid,kojira} /etc/sysconfig/
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Restore users and home directories
      * If _newkoji_ is on a separate host from _newdb_, then just simply copy over the files:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# dirclone /root/hubrestore/home /home
root@newkoji# cp -a /root/hubrestore/etc/{passwd,shadow,group,gshadow} /etc
&lt;/pre&gt;
      * If _newkoji_ is on the same host as _newdb_, then you will have to be more careful:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
## Skip home directories for the special users
root@newkoji# for dir in /root/hubrestore/home/*; do
   bndir=$(basename &quot;$dir&quot;)
   if &amp;#91;&amp;#91; $bndir != koji &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $bndir != postgres &amp;#93;&amp;#93; ; then
      dirclone &quot;$dir&quot; /home/&quot;$bndir&quot;
   fi
done
## Now merge the passwd, group, shadow, and gshadow files in /etc.
## Make sure that your editor does not create backup files
## (&quot;set nobackup&quot; in vim), and that shadow and gshadow are owned by
## root and have 0400 permissions.
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Ensure a &#39;koji&#39; user exists
   1. Fix dirs in =/var=:&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# rm -rf /var/lib/mock/*
root@newkoji# chown root:mock /var/lib/mock
root@newkoji# chmod 2775 /var/lib/mock
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Restore =/var/www/html= and =/var/spool/cron= (TODO)
      =/var= should have been backed up, but in case it isn&#39;t, the following files need to exist in =/var/www/html=:
      * A symlink =mnt -&amp;gt; /mnt=
      * A robots.txt with contents&lt;pre&gt;User-agent: *
Disallow: /&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ II.3. Fixing Names

This section should be done if _newdb_ or _newkoji_ do not have the same as
the previous db server and hub (i.e. _db-01.batlab.org_ and _koji.chtc.wisc.edu_).
This section should be completed on _newkoji_.

---++++ Fixing config files if _newdb_ was renamed

The only change that&#39;s needed if _newdb_ was renamed is to =/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf=.
Edit that file and change the !DBHost line to point to the new hostname.
After editing, make sure =hub.conf= is owned by =root:apache= and chmodded 0640.

---++++ Installing new cert/key pairs for _newkoji_

You will need two cert/key pairs: one for the host, and one for the kojira service.
Run =dos2unix= on all cert and key files before using them.
Define the shell function =makepem=, listed below.
=makepem= combines a public and private keypair to make a .pem file that the koji services use.

Usage: &lt;code&gt;makepem &lt;em&gt;certfile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;keyfile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;output_file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
makepem () {
   certfile=$1
   keyfile=$2
   outputfile=$3
   (set -e
   keymodulus=$(openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in &quot;$keyfile&quot;)
   certmodulus=$(openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in &quot;$certfile&quot;)
   if &amp;#91;&amp;#91; $keymodulus != $certmodulus &amp;#93;&amp;#93; ; then
      echo &#39;keyfile and certfile do not match!&#39;; return 1
   fi
   if &amp;#91;&amp;#91; -f $outputfile &amp;#93;&amp;#93; ; then
      mv -f &quot;$outputfile&quot;{,.bak}
   fi
   (dos2unix &amp;lt; &quot;$certfile&quot;; echo; dos2unix &amp;lt; &quot;$keyfile&quot;) &amp;gt; &quot;$outputfile&quot;
   chmod 0600 &quot;$outputfile&quot;)
}&lt;/pre&gt;

Place cert and key files into the following paths:

| host cert | =/root/hostcert.pem= |
| host key | =/root/hostkey.pem= |
| kojira cert | =/root/kojiracert.pem= |
| kojira key | =/root/kojirakey.pem= |

Then use =makepem= to combine the certs and put them in the proper locations.
&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# makepem /root/hostcert.pem /root/hostkey.pem \
   /etc/pki/tls/private/kojiweb.pem
root@newkoji# makepem /root/kojiracert.pem /root/kojirakey.pem \
   /etc/pki/tls/private/kojira.pem
root@newkoji# chown apache:apache /etc/pki/tls/private/kojiweb.pem
root@newkoji# chown root:root /etc/pki/tls/private/kojira.pem&lt;/pre&gt;

In addition, copy the host cert and key into the locations HTTPD expects it them.
&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# cp -a /root/hostcert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/hostcert.pem
root@newkoji# cp -a /root/hostkey.pem /etc/pki/tls/private/hostkey.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;


---++++ Fixing hostname in config files

Use sed to replace the hostname in the following config files in /etc:
   * =/etc/kojira/kojira.conf=
   * =/etc/koji.conf=
   * =/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf=
   * =/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojiweb.conf=
   * =/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf=
   * =/etc/kojid/kojid.conf=
You will need to fix =/etc/kojid/kojid.conf= on all builder machines as well
(e.g. _kojibuilder2.chtc.wisc.edu_).

---++++ Fixing hostname in database

You will need to find and fix entries that contain the hostname in the following tables:
   * =host= (should be 1 entry)
   * =users= (should be 2 entries, one for the host, and one for the kojira user)

---++++ Fixing hostname elsewhere

These steps are only necessary if you cannot get a DNS Canonical Name (CN) record
such that _koji.chtc.wisc.edu_ resolves to _newkoji_.

   1. Update the repo definitions in the _osg-release_ package
   1. Update the mash script(s) at the GOC
   1. Mail the software team and users that anyone using the _minefield_ repos will need to update _osg-release_
   1. Fix all the build machines to point to the new name
   1. Fix the following files in _osg-build_ and make a new release
      * =data/osg-koji-home.conf=
      * =data/osg-koji-site.conf=
      * =osgbuild/constants.py=
      * =osgbuild/kojiinter.py=
   1. Mail people that they will need to update _osg-build_ and rerun =osg-koji setup=

---+++ II.4 Starting Services and Validation

Now you will start up Koji services and verify that they function.
Prerequisite: previous restore steps have been completed and =postgresql= is
running on the database host.

All steps will be run on _newkoji_.

   1. Start the main koji daemon: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# service httpd start&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Use =ps= to verify that it came up
   1. Connect to the web interface in your browser.\
      Make sure you can use https and you can log in.
   1. As yourself, run the =koji= command-line tool and make a few queries\
      (e.g. list-tags)
   1. Start the koji build daemon: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# service kojid start&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Use =ps= to verify that it came up

If you did not restore the =/mnt/koji/repos= directory, you will now need to
regenerate the build repos. Use =koji list-tags= to get a list of tags
and run =koji regen-repo= on all of the ones with =-build= in the name.
This *will* take several hours. You will also need to regen the
=-development= repos so that _minefield_ works again. Keep an eye on
the tasks in the web interface to make sure they are getting farmed out
to the right hosts.

   1. Try a scratch build
   1. Start =kojira=: &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
root@newkoji# service kojira start&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Use =ps= to verify that it came up
   1. Wait half a minute and use =ps= to verify that =kojid= is still up;
      the two processes can kick each other off if they are both using the
      same certificate
   1. Bump a package if needed and try a real, non-scratch build
   1. Make sure that kojira is regenerating the repos

If you have updated _osg-release_ and/or _osg-build_, rebuild those packages
now.
