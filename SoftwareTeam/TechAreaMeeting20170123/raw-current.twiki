---+++ Discussions

   * !BrianL will be taking over as Software Manager, Mat will officially become technical lead, and !TimC will still contribute a portion of his time to Software. !TimC will accept promotion requests until further notice.
   * HTCondor 8.4.11 and 8.6.0 are expected to be released today and Thursday, respectively, after which we can finish builds, tests, and promotions for [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2565][SOFTWARE-2565]] and [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2564][SOFTWARE-2564]].
   * Issues were discovered during last week&#39;s Koji build system update and were debugged with the help of Koji developers. Mat will attempt to perform the upgrade again tomorrow, 1/24/17, at 10:30 AM CT.

---+++ Support Update
   * BNL (Marian/BrianL) - systemd issues on CentOS7, further investigation required
   * CHTC (!BrianL) - Found two more CHTC submit nodes that were contributing to bad records. One was HEP-owned and was fixed (needs verification). We need to find out who the admin is of the other.
   * IIT (Marty) - Production OSG glideins submitted to both IIT_CE1/2 are now correctly routed to RHEL6/7 entries and worker nodes. Glideins are successfully running user jobs across multiple clusters behind these CEs. However, site admin may have route job limits in place. We also observe many held glideins with hold reason &quot;CE job in status 1 put on hold by SYSTEM_PERIODIC_HOLD due to non-existent route in JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES or route job limit&quot;. Followed up with site admin about route jobs limits as well as plan to decommission IIT_CE used for initial testing.
   * LBL (!BrianL) - Helped with CE/submit host authorization issues
