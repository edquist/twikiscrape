*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

Development freeze is next Tuesday. Please get tickets Ready For Testing as soon as possible.

For the MIT GUMS configuration issues (see below), this is not the first time that subtle configuration issues have caused lengthy GUMS failures. Can we start a GUMS configuration “lint” tool to partially automate the checking of a GUMS configuration? To start, is it possible to fully or partially automate the detection of whatever issue tripped up MIT? !BrianL will own the process for identifying an initial problem space, defining a solution, getting feedback from others, and implementing an initial version.

---+++ Support Update
   * MIT (!BrianL) - Finally fixed the GUMS config to get CDF jobs running
