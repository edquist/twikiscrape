&lt;!-- !BrianB, !BrianL, Carl, Edgar, Igor, !JohnW, Mat, Suchandra, !TimC, !TimT, Xin --&gt;

---++ Announcements

Suchandra will be moving 50% of his effort to CIC. Mostly, he will focus on Release team duties, including running and testing on his ITB instance, but he will do some Software team tasks as appropriate. !TimC is still identifying other Software team members to take on some of Suchandra’s development activities; the new assignments will be done very soon, so that Suchandra can use outstanding tasks to help transition overall maintenance.

%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)
   * Many more things … coming soon …

---+++ Notes

*HTCondor-CE and PBS:* Suchandra has dealt with the NFS issues. Now, he is looking at some Globus RSL issues; Tony Tiradani has seen something similar. !BrianB gave Suchandra some configuration changes to try. Among other things, there are some UNL-specific configuration items in the RPM, which !BrianB will clean out in the next release.
