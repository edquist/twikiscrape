---++ Readiness for OSG Software 3.1 Release

Everyone agrees we are ready for release. Scot is building a new RSV right now (but tested under a different version number), Doug tested the SE on SL6 last week, and Tim says that the nightly test failures are all due to test problems, _not_ software problems. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Alain*: Trained the OGS GOC on supporting the OSG Software Stack last week. ([[Operations.VDTSoftwareTraining][Details]])
   * *Doug*: Last week was testing of SL6 installs. Tested HDFS and Bestman onto Fermicloud, and they&#39;re all working. Good to go on SL6 release. This week Doug will be pushing on releasing the new Betsman release that removes dependecies from the build. 
   * *Marco*: Nothing to report.
   * *Mat*: Last week, solved problems with JDK package (installing on top of official JDK broke /usr/bin/java symlink). Will be in the release. Debugged problem with lcmaps that prevented installs and updated on 32-bit platforms. 
   * *Neha*: Spent a lot of time catching up FermiCloud support and operations. Worked on 32-bit support in FermiCloud, and it&#39;s nearly there. The dCache test stand now is now up with static IPs and good names, currently installing dCache on them. Did a lot of software support. Started new ticket on GUMS client problems that needs John&#39;s help.
   * *Scot*: Mostly working on class last week. Wrapping up RSV odds and ends, will cut release today.
   * *Tim*: Released osg-test this morning, tests will start running shortly. Haven&#39;t had time to code reviews yet, but will do so soon. 
   * *Xin*: Site still up and running. Will try out EL6 RPMs on worker nodes soon, working with support group to do so. Was briefly confused by lfc-python26 not being needed on SL6 anymore because lfc-python defaults to Python 2.6. (And Marco confirmed that Python 2.4 support is definitely not needed on SL6 anymore.) Will run ATLAS jobs on it soon.
