---++ Transition to new support process

No one is uncomfortable with it, so we&#39;ll proceed. Alain will work out technical details with the Operations Team.

Mat would like a &quot;who does what&quot; page, so we know who to assign tickets too. Agreed.

---++ Readiness for OSG Software 3.0.6 release

No major concerns. Minor concerns that do not block this release:

   * Suchandra will double-check [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-417][SOFTWARE-417]] (GIP file ownership problem) to ensure it&#39;s fixed for this release. We have the updated GIP from Tony. 
   * Marco noted that he was able to install =empty-condor= after non-RPM Condor is installed. This appears to be a bug, but shouldn&#39;t stop a release. After the meeting he created [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-507][SOFTWARE-507]] to track this.
   * Doug asked about Dave Dykstra&#39;s work on LCMAPS. It&#39;s not ready, but Dave hopes it&#39;s ready by the end of February. We&#39;ll find testers for it soon. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: Had a few issues with Bestman2. All known issues are resolved, will ship in tomorrow&#39;s release. They were configuration issues. Also worked with issues with HDFS packages, will be fixed soon. Also fixing documentation issues with HDFS. 
   * *Marco*: Has been testing RSV with Condor. Worked on other documentation.
   * *Mat*: Finished major reorganization of osg-build. Did bug fixes. GUMS 1.4 work is on hold until new version from John. 
   * *Maxim*: glexec testing is working fine. It&#39;s straightforward, but needs to be updated to match new organization of osg-test. Will be finished today. Needs more work.
   * *Neha*: Worked with osg-system-profiler, gave feedback. Found problem with gratia !GridFTP probe failing with new versions of Python. Also worked on [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-483][SOFTWARE-483]]
   * *Scot*: Worked on RSV and Condor-Cron, so they work with non-standard location of Condor. Released Pacman update. 
   * *Suchandra*: Minor fixes to osg-configure. Did ITB testing for Pacman release. 
   * *Terrence*: Things are quiet, need more work due to delays in getting working version of GUMS 1.4.
   * *Tim*: Lots of work on testing, out sick today.
   * *Xin*: Just returned from three weeks of vacation. Had questions about RSV using non-standard Condor install. Had problems with using RSV with a user proxy. Scot will look into it.
