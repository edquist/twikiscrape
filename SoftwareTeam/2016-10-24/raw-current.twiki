%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| November | 3.3.18 | 2016-10-24 | 2016-10-31 | 2016-11-08 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
   * Status of GOC repository consolidation: Working to get Phase II (decommission software.grid.iu.edu) done yet this calendar year.
   * Review of some key decisions from the OSG documentation meeting in Indy last week:
      * Internal documents will remain in TWiki for now
      * Some internal webs have been blocked from robots already and eventually all of the TWiki will be blocked
      * No new features to TWiki and will be trying to simplify its implementation (e.g., Kyle killed the status boxes last week!)
      * Please help identify content in the =SoftwareTeam= web that should be public (e.g., the release schedules, maybe the team member lists)
      * External content will move to a new CMS eventually
   * Get tickets done! 11 out of 14 JIRA tickets for November are still Open or In&amp;nbsp;Progress
   * Given the operational successes at Utah, Nebraska, and possibly elsewhere, we now feel comfortable recommending that sites with SLURM backends use the BLAHP&amp;rsquo;s native SLURM translation layer. So, Brian&amp;nbsp;L. will draft an email to Software and Operations to that effect to get the process started. We will think about making a broad announcement later, if it seems important.

---+++ Support Update

   * UFL (!BrianL) - jobs incorrectly held due to expired proxy, update to latest blahp seemed to break job caching, reverted to old blahp.
