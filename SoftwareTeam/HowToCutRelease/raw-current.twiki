---+ How to Cut a Software Release

%TOC{depth=&quot;3&quot;}%

This document details the process for releasing new OSG Release version(s). This document does NOT discuss the policy for deciding what goes into a release, which can be found [[SoftwareTeam.ReleasePolicy][here]].

Due to the length of time that this process takes, it is recommended to do the release over three or more days to allow for errors to be corrected and tests to be run.

---++ Requirements

   * User certificate registered with OSG&#39;s koji with build and release team privileges 
   * An account on UW CS machines (e.g. library, ingwe) to access UW&#39;s AFS
   * Convenience scripts from [[%TOOL_SRC%][GitHub]]
   * =osg-build= scripts in your =PATH= (installed via OSG yum repos or [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build][source]])

---++ Pick the Version Number

Enter the verions numbers for each OSG version to be released (e.g. =3.3.12 3.2.38 upcoming=) and click submit to 

&lt;form action=&quot;https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/HowToCutRelease&quot;&gt;
Versions: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;versions&quot; size=&quot;10&quot; value=&quot;%URLPARAM{&quot;versions&quot;}%&quot;/&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

---++ Day 0: Generate Preliminary Release List

The release manager often needs a tentative list of packages to be released. This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release.

---+++ Step 1: Update the osg-version RPM

For each release (excluding upcoming), update the version number in the osg-version RPM&#39;s spec file and build it in koji:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%RED%# If building for the latest release out of trunk:%ENDCOLOR%
osg-build koji osg-version
%RED%# If building for an older release out of a branch:%ENDCOLOR%
osg-build koji --repo=MAJOR_VERSION osg-version
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where =MAJOR_VERSION= is of the format =x.y= (e.g. =3.2=).

---+++ Step 2: Promote osg-version and generate the release list

Run =0-generate-pkg-list= from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% git clone %TOOL_SRC%.git
%UCL_PROMPT% cd release-tools
%UCL_PROMPT% 0-generate-pkg-list %VERSIONS%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Day 1: Verify Pre-Release and Generate Tarballs

This section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release and create the client tarballs.

---+++ Step 1: Verify Pre-Release

Compare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated =release-list= in git). To do this, run the =1-verify-prerelease= script from git:

&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% 1-verify-prerelease %VERSIONS%
&lt;/pre&gt;

If there are any discrepancies consult the release manager. You may have to tag or untag packages with the =osg-koji= tool.

*NOTE:* Please verify that the =osg-version= RPM is in your set of packages for the release! Also verify that if there is a new version of the =osg-tested-internal= RPM, then it is included in the release as well! 

---+++ Step 2: Test Pre-Release in VM Universe

To test pre-release, you will be kicking off a manual VM universe test run from =osghost.chtc.wisc.edu=.

   1. Ensure that you meet the [[SoftwareTeam.TestRunsAsVMs][pre-requisites]] for submitting VM universe test runs
   1. Prepare the test suite by running:\
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
osg-run-tests &#39;Testing OSG pre-release&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. =cd= into the directory specified in the output of the previous command
   1. =cd= into =parameters.d= and remove all files within it except for =osg33-el6.yaml= and =osg33-el7.yaml=
   1. Edit =osg33-el6.yaml= so that it reads:\
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
platforms:
  - centos_6_x86_64
  - rhel_6_x86_64
  - sl_6_x86_64

  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.1; osg &gt; 3.3/osg-prerelease
%IF{&quot;%CALC{$FIND(upcoming, %VERSIONS%)}% != 0&quot;
then=&#39;  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg-upcoming-prerelease, osg-upcoming
  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg &gt; osg-upcoming-prerelease, osg-upcoming&#39;}% &lt;!--Unfortunately, setting this as a TWiki variable inexplicably breaks IF statements--&gt;

  - label: All
    selinux: False
    osg_java: True
    packages:
      - osg-tested-internal
  - label: All + GRAM
    selinux: False
    osg_java: True
    packages:
      - osg-tested-internal
      - globus-gatekeeper
      - globus-gram-client-tools

      - globus-gram-job-manager-condor
      - globus-gram-job-manager-pbs-setup-seg
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Edit =osg33-el7.yaml= so that it reads:\
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
platforms:
  - centos_7_x86_64
  - rhel_7_x86_64
  - sl_7_x86_64

sources:
  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg-prerelease
  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg &gt; osg-prerelease
%IF{&quot;%CALC{$FIND(upcoming, %VERSIONS%)}% != 0&quot;
then=&#39;  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg-upcoming-prerelease, osg-upcoming
  - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg &gt; osg-upcoming-prerelease, osg-upcoming&#39;}% &lt;!--Unfortunately, setting this as a TWiki variable inexplicably breaks IF statements--&gt;

package_sets:
  - label: All
    selinux: False
    osg_java: True
    packages:
      - osg-tested-internal
  - label: All + GRAM
    selinux: False
    osg_java: True
    packages:
      - osg-tested-internal-gram
&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. =cd= back into the root directory of the test run (e.g. =cd ..=)
   1. Submit the DAG:\
&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
condor_submit_dag master-run.dag
&lt;/pre&gt;

%RED% *NOTE:* %ENDCOLOR% If there are failures, consult the release-manager before proceeding.

---+++ Step 3: Regenerate the build repositories

To avoid 404 errors when retrieving packages, it&#39;s necessary to regenerate the build repositories. Run the following script from a machine with your koji-registered user certificate:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% 1-regen-repos %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Step 4: Create the client tarballs

Create the client tarballs as root on an EL6 fermicloud machine using the relevant script from git:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% git clone %TOOL_SRC%.git
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd release-tools
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% 1-client-tarballs %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should get up to 8 tarballs for each version (excluding upcoming), 25-55 megs each and they should all have the version number in the name.

---+++ Step 5: Briefly test the client tarballs

As an *unprivileged user*, extract each tarball into a separate directory. Make sure osg-post-install works. Make sure &#39;osgrun osg-version&#39; works by running the following tests:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
dotest () {
    file=$dir/$client-$ver-1.$rhel.$arch.tar.gz
    mkdir -p $rhel-$arch
    pushd $rhel-$arch
    tar xzf ../$file
    $client/osg/osg-post-install
    $client/osgrun osg-version
    popd
    rm -rf $rhel-$arch
}

pushd /tmp

for client in osg-afs-client osg-wn-client; do
    for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
        for rhel in el6 el7; do
            arch=x86_64
            dir=tarballs/${ver%.*}/$arch
            dotest
        done
    done
done

client=osg-wn-client
arch=i386
rhel=el6
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    dir=tarballs/${ver%.*}/$arch
    dotest
done&lt;/pre&gt;

If you have time, try some of the binaries, such as grid-proxy-init.

*NOTE:* We need to automate this and have it run on the proper architectures and version of RHEL.

---+++ Step 6: Update the UW AFS installation of the tarball client

The UW keeps an install of the tarball client in =/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client= on the UW&#39;s AFS. To update it, run the following commands:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/afs-install-tarball-client $ver
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Step 7: Wait

Wait for clearance. The OSG Release Coordinator (in consultation with the Software Team and any testers) need to sign off on the update before it is released.  If you are releasing things over two days, this is a good place to stop for the day.

---++ Day 2: Pushing the Release

%RED% *NOTE:* %ENDCOLOR% For the second phase of the release, try to complete it earlier in the day rather than later. The GOC would like to send out the release announcement prior to 3 p.m. Eastern time.

---+++ Step 1: Push from pre-release to release

This script moves the packages into release, clones releases into new version-specific release repos, locks the repos and regenerates them. Afterwards, it produces &amp;#42;release-note* files that should be used to update the TWiki release note pages. Clone it from the github repo and run the script:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% 2-create-release %VERSIONS%
&lt;/pre&gt;

   1. *.txt files are also created and it should be verified that they&#39;ve been moved to /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/ on UW&#39;s AFS.
   1. For each release version, use the =*release-note*= files to update the relevant sections of the release note pages.

---+++ Step 2: Upload the client tarballs

Ask Tim Theisen, Brian Lin, or someone with privileges on the grid.iu.edu repo servers to upload the tarballs with the following procedure:

---++++ On a CS machine
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    major_ver=`sed &#39;s/.[0-9]*$//&#39; &lt;&lt;&lt; $ver`
    cd /p/vdt/public/html/tarball-client
    ssh jump.grid.iu.edu mkdir /tmp/$ver/
    scp -p $major_ver/*/*$ver*gz jump.grid.iu.edu:/tmp/$ver/
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++++ On jump.grid.iu.edu
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    rm -f /tmp/$ver/*-afs-*
    scp -pr /tmp/$ver repo1:/tmp/
    scp -pr /tmp/$ver repo2:/tmp/
    rm -rf /tmp/$ver
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++++ On repo1/repo2 (as root)
You can ssh to repo1 and repo2 from jump.grid.iu.edu; you will need to do this procedure on both systems.
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;sudo su -&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    major_ver=`sed &#39;s/.[0-9]*$//&#39; &lt;&lt;&lt; $ver`
    mv /tmp/$ver /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/$major_ver/
    rm -f /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/$major_ver/*latest*
done
/root/mk-sims.sh
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    major_ver=`sed &#39;s/.[0-9]*$//&#39; &lt;&lt;&lt; $ver`
    ls -l /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/$major_ver/*latest* # verify the symlinks are correct
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Step 3: Install the tarballs into OASIS

%RED%You must be an OASIS manager of the =mis= VO to do these steps.%ENDCOLOR%
Known managers as of 2014-07-22: Mat, Tim C, Tim T, Brian L.
Get the uploader script from Git and run it with =osgrun= from the UW AFS install of the tarball client you made earlier.
On a UW CSL machine:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;cd /tmp
git clone --depth 1 file:///p/vdt/workspace/git/repo/tarball-client.git
for ver in %VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UPCOMING%; do
    /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/sys/osgrun /tmp/tarball-client/upload-tarballs-to-oasis $ver
done
&lt;/pre&gt;
The script will automatically ssh you to oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org and give you instructions to complete the process.

---+++ Step 4: Remove old UW AFS installations of the tarball client

To keep space usage down, remove tarball client installations and symlinks under =/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client= on UW&#39;s AFS that are more than 2 months old.
The following command will remove them:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
find /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client -maxdepth 1 -mtime +60 -name 3\* -ls -exec rm -rf {} \;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Step 5: Announce the release

The following instructions are meant for the release manager (or interim release manager). If you are not the release manager, let the release manager know that they can announce the release.

   1. The release manager writes the release announcement and send it out. Here is a sample, replace &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCFF;&quot;&gt;highlighted text&lt;/span&gt; with the appropriate values:\
   &lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Announcing OSG Software version &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCFF;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VERSION(S)&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; \
   &lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;We are pleased to announce OSG Software version &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCFF;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VERSION(S)&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;!

This is the new OSG Software distributed via RPMs for:

* Scientific Linux 5 and 6
* !CentOS 5 and 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6

This release affects the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCFF;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;SET-OF-METAPACKAGES (client, compute element, etc...)&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Changes include:

* Major change 1
* Major change 2
* Major change 3
