---++ Interview Questions 

   1 Do you use VORS programatically or for human readable information  gathering? (If programatically see question 2, if visually skip to  question 6)
   2 Where do you get you information? (tindex.cgi, ntindex.cgi,  OSG_map_info.txt, tindex3.cgi, other)
   3 These pages include several pieces of information, what do you  use? What do you not use?
   4 Is the CSV format provided good for you? What other format would  you suggest getting the information you us in?
   5 What other information would you be able to use if it were  provided? (Done with questions)
   6 What pieces of visual information do you use? Which do you not  use? (Map, VOs Supported Table, Detailed Resource Environment Info,  other)
   7 What other information would you like to see in a human readable  format that VORS does not provide you with?

---++ Summary of Answers by User

| Sebastian Goasguen | |
| 1 | I use the status map from my desktop machine (cilab.cs.clemson.edu) | 
| 2 | Uses map | 
| 3 | NA |
| 4 | NA |
| 5 | NA |
| 6 | I basically use the map.  I just need to click on a site and get basic information as well as the green/red status to verify everything is fine |
| 7 | &#39;MyOSG&#39; seems pretty good |

| Malina Kirn | |
| 1 | Contacted and she has not been able to track down the system that accessed VORS.  (It had only 1 visit in all of March so it is likely an individual accessing the human interface.) |

| Ian Stokes-Reese | |
| 1 | Peter Doherty accessed VORS in March (which covers the 3 visits) but he now uses &#39;MyOSG&#39; (and likes it).   Ian Stokes-Reese says they do not rely on VORS in any way and has no problem with its elimination |

| Steven Clark | |
| 1 | 41 uses in a month | 
| 2 | He uses one of the tindex urls (didn’t specify) | 
| 3 | Now we do our own test of all sites that support &#39;NanoHUB&#39;.  Run scanning test (4-5 tests – is it there, can I connect, can I run simple job - hello world).  Put results on display &amp; use results to direct jobs.   	Actually use site ID, name, url, pass/fail state.   Site ID is a directory for site results – Purdue uses same directory structure as VORS did.   Site ID is invariant, so Purdue uses that for downstream processing – unaffected by site name changes.   Simplest if ID was there and still the same one as VORS had.  |
| 4 | CSV works fine – simple scripts can parse it.   Would like a reader for xml file if xml is what is provided (the MyOSG xml file has a commented section that seams to specify the structure, but it  doesn’t look like it would be readable by a xml parser).   Would be best if you produced an identical CSV file, then only the url would have to be changed and tested once |
| 5 | Indication of processor availability or queue length would be great |
| 6 | Look at map to compare nanoHUB report to VORS map.   Also looks at details of status for a site (by clicking it in the table below the map).  Uses it to find the directories for data, etc., and what job manager is running (e.g. condor) |
| 7 | Steven has all the issues with &#39;MyOSG&#39; Status map that were documented in issue 47 at http://code.google.com/p/osggoc/issues/list.   In addition, the drop down site list doesn’t correspond with the actual status page.  There are 2 Purdue sites in the dropdown (Purdue-CMS and Purdue-NWICG), yet the status list shows Purdue-RCAC, Purdue-CMS, &amp; Purdue Steele.   The map only shows one ? for Purdue and it is called Purdue Caesar.   Steven believes that there should be 3 sites: Purdue-RCAC, Purdue-Caesar, and Purdue-Steele |

| 1 | Confirmed that from an EGEE APEL accounting standpoint, VORS is ready to be decommissioned. |

| Shawn !McKee or Bob Ball | |
| 1 | When used, it is for human readable information gathering. | 
| 2 | | 
| 3 | |
| 4 | |
| 5 | |
| 6 | Primarily used for either the VOs supported table and detailed resource environment info.   Sometime as a quick check of status via the map. |
| 7 | I think the MyOSG page provides us with most of the information we want for such a service.  As a related comment we liked and extensively used the MonaLISA pages when they were available and felt it was much more effective than VORS for our needs. |

| Patricia Bittencourt | |
| 1 | For human readable information. Once in a while. | 
| 2 | | 
| 3 | |
| 4 | |
| 5 | |
| 6 | Usually just to confirm that our CE services are up and running. Sometimes also check the CMSSW versions published (Detailed Resource Information) and the &quot;Resource Functional Test Results&quot;. |
| 7 | Other necessary information is already covered by other monitoring tools (RSV, bdii). |

| In-Saeng Suh | |
| 1 | Programatically | 
| 2 | http://vors.grid.iu.edu/OSG_map_info.txt | 
| 3 |All |
| 4 | N/A |
| 5 | N/A  |
| 6 | All forms of visual information |
| 7 | None |

| Rob Gardner | |
| 1 | human readable, but both would be desirable (generally) | 
| 2 | | 
| 3 | I typically have used VORS to look a the contact information (host names and port numbers) for services. |
| 4 | |
| 5 | |
| 6 | I don&#39;t use the map.  I have used the  VO&#39;s supported table and detailed resource environment. |
| 7 | None at the moment. |

| Doug Olson or Shreyas Cholia | |
| 1 | Programatically: An older version of the cert scripts still uses VORS, but the newer versions do not. Other than that he&#39;s not using it. |
| 2 | Doug supplied a link www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/vo.php | 
| 3 | It retrieves a list of VOs |
| 4 | The current format works fine with the new scripts. |
| 5 | No additional requests |
| 6 | n/a (uses programatically) |
| 7 | Not specifically VORS, but the OIM VO information is less compact, uses a lot of screen real estate . Doug would like a &quot;phonebook&quot; type interface in OIM where a personal contact will show which resource or which VO they&#39;re related to. |

| Steve Gallo or Jon Bendesz | Steve states that all information needed is able to be gathered from MyOSG |
| 1 | N/A | 
| 2 | N/A | 
| 3 | N/A |

| David Sanders | |
| 1 | Uses the human readable information. | 
| 2 | n/a | 
| 3 | n/a |
| 4 | n/a |
| 5 | n/a |
| 6 | David uses the map, the tables and site verify information to check on the status of his resources. |
| 7 | David also uses MONalisa and ganglia and likes that MONalisa allows you to see the load and how many jobs are running and by whom and Ganglia allows him to get a feel node by node for which are being used. |
