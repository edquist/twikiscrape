---+ IPv6 Testing Log: Glite FTS client

This testing log is part of [[Sandbox.OperationsServicesIPv6CompatibilityTable][OSG IPv6 tests]]. This page captures the specific IPv6 compatibility testing process used for one software component, GLiteFTS client. The more general IPv6 template for testing is [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/IPV6Testing][here]].


---++ Initial Setup

This test used two hosts:

| *Host* | *OS* | *OSG Release* |
|fts3-kit-02-hepix.gridka.de  | ?? |  ??  |
| cabinet-10-10-1.t2.ucsd.edu | CentOS release 6.6 (Final) | 3.2 |

---+++ Installing software

Next, OSG software was installed on each system. The UCSD host was the client and the GRIDKA host was the server

| *Host* | *Package* | *Version* |
| fts3-kit-02-hepix.gridka.de | ?? |  NA |
| cabinet-10-10-1.t2.ucsd.edu | glite-fts-client | 3.7.4-9.osg32.el6  |



---++ Testing

---+++ Testing the dual-dual configuration: Yes
