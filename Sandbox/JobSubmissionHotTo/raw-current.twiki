---++ How to submit an Auto-Pilot Job.

   * Step 1) Download the setup file (charmmSetup.sh in case of CHARMM) from a pre-specified location. Lets call this file, SetupFile.
   * Step 2) Execute SetupFile. It inturn downloads all the other files necessary for Auto-Pilot job submission (mainly EnvironFile and JobSubFile) from a location specified in   
                 the file itself. Also, it sets up the directory structure required for successful job submission.
   * Step 3) Execute EnvironFile (charmmJob.sh in case of CHARMM). This creates an environment for required for execution of the code that submits the job. It also makes sure that
                 all the required input variables for the job are present. Input variables like exe (actual experiment executable),  inurl (code repository location, can be different from the 
                 earlier locations),  outurl (location where output of the job needs to be finally stored) etc. After creating a friendly environment, executes JobSubFile 
                 (charmmJob.py in case of CHARMM). This file contains code that actually submits the job.

Thats all a user has to do to submit an Auto-Pilot job.


Lets understand,  the process of actual job execution thereafter.

When the JobSubFile executes, it collects all the inputs required for the job, bundles them together and submits the job to the panda server. Panda server matches this submitted job to a remote computing resource. When the job starts executing at the remote computing resource, a SetupScript (trans-charmm-1.sh in case of CHARMM) is executed. This script downloads a couple of files (mainly EnvironScript and ExptExecutable) that are necessary for the job to execute. It also executes EnvironScript (runcharmm.csh in case of CHARMM). EnvironScript creates the environment necessary for the execution of the experiment specific exectuble. After setting up the environment, it executes the actual experiment executable ExptExecutable (c33a2-lrg.one in case of CHARMM).

Incase, someone wants to use the Auto-Pilot to submit jobs for a different experiment (other than CHARMM), he/she will have to modify all the files/scripts mentioned above.

*Note: Clicking on the file name would take you to a detailed description of that file. This description is specific to CHARMM implementation.*
