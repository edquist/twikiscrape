How do I create a personal Description template, such as a personal signature, in Footprints?

You should be able to create your own personal Quick Descriptions. Just go to *My Preferences &gt;&gt; Configure Quick Descriptions/Signatures* and it is self-explanatory from there.

This is nice for signatures or Descriptions you would specifically use often when replying to customers. If the team would benefit from having the use of your Description, do not make it a personal Quick Description. Instead, please notify the OSG Footprints project administrator (Tim) who will make it a global Quick Description.
