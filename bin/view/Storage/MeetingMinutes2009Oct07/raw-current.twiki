Andrew:
&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
Investigated quota management in hadoop.
Wrote a plug in to report free space left based on current quota and
default number of file replicas.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ted:
&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;

Made changes to caching code in response to STG testing of discovery tool. 
Found a issue with XML merge function, investigated, formulated solution. 
Made with STG a plan for next release: 
        add automatic update of cache
        allow file-based configuration of tool (especially BDII server
address)
        fix bug. 

Tool will then go to VDT test cache.

Got description of SCEC from Dan Katz -will put on SCEC OSG twiki page.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha:
&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
Tests suite re-design:
     Learning how to use Eclipse
     Deployed the UML plugin and worked on activity/class diagrams

Handled GOC tickets and users support
&lt;/pre&gt;

Alex:
&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;

* Support
  - srm-copy usage for a recursive directory transfer on bestman full mode
  - transfer performance discussion on bestman full mode for STAR,
between BNL and NERSC
  - discussion on enforcement of static space token on bestman/hadoop
  - open ticket for srm-copy for handling a request with multiple files
that have the same source URLs and different target URLs - adding a new
use case is on the way in the next release.
  - srm daily test setup on srm://meson.fis.cinvestav.mx:8443/srm/v2/server
    and support for sudo configuration.

* bestman 2.2.1.3 release
   - re-packaging for rephrasing CHANGES logs on Tanya&#39;s recommendation
and sync timing to the release date

* bestman 2.2.1.3.1 release
   - fixed voms validation for glite, and verified at FZK
   - tested and pacakged
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Hadoop quotas problems &amp; &quot;du&quot; script (Andrew)

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Andrew has encountered several problems while setting quotas  in hadoop. Brian has asked him to create a test so it could be reproduced at Nebraska and reported to Hadoop developers if there is indeed a bug. Andrew has written a script that imitates &quot;du&quot;, so it could be used by !BeStMan to report the available storage size for a particular static space token. Tanya will test it first and then will give it to Brian so it could be tested at Nebraska as well. 

Brian has reported some other problems with quotas (under rare circumstances renaming of the file could cause data lost).


---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Storage discovery tools

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Ted is working on bug fixes, will release soon to VDT test cache.

Brian has fully configured GIP at Nebraska, so the information about surl and local mapping could be extracted from BDII. Ted will test this with discovery tools first. If the results are positive we should notify LIGO so they can start testing as well.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;

SCEC Status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Ted is still waiting from UFlorida to fully configure GIP.

From Mats:
&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;

I&#39;m still trying to unpack the data. It takes about 24 hours, and I have
had a couple of false starts.
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dcache release and ITB testing of our new update/installation procedure
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

dcache golden release is not ready yet - apparent problems with srm (deadlock under heavy load)

Steve Timm is doing the upgrade and will let us know if he found any problems with migration and upgrade.
