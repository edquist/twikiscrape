---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
RSV Storage probes status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Doug is wrapping up the development of  RSV storage probes (srm-client probes and srmtester). The preliminary results could be seen [[https://gw014k1.fnal.gov:8443/rsv][here]]. 

---++ Second agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
BNL NERSC problems report
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Alex has submitted the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Storage/MeetingMinutes2010May05/BNL_NERSC_FTS_DT_trouble-100428.pdf][report]] that described all the problems and fixes encountered during BNL acceptance test at NERSC with !BeStMan-fullmode installation.
Tanya has discussed with Doug Benjamin the possibility to register our teststands for ATLAS acceptance tests, so we can see problems with FTS-!BeStMan  before releases.  

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dcache transfer probes
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Andrew has reported that the test and probe are ready. Brian had problem to run the tests. Andrew has sent instructions and will add them to svn. Andrew will ask Chris to build the probe, so we can install rpms and test them on gridwork cluster.


---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Documentation
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Ted has continued work on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/StorageSiteAdministrator][Storage for Site Administrators]].

According  statistic&#39;s compiled by Robert, work on storage documentation improvement going pretty well:

Storage        : 0.52 documents per day : 62 documents total :  119 more days needed

---++ Fifth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Xrootd configuration
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Tanya is working on new xrootd configuration requested by ATLAS. This configuration should be flexible enough to accommodate standalone xrootd installation for small T3 as well as allow T2 to setup SE with !BestMan-gateway/xrootd. One of the new requests is to add security configuration on xrootd level.
