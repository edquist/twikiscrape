%TOC%

The grid-enabled Hadoop DFS utilizes normal Globus !GridFTP servers with a specialized plugin in order to do transfers.  Because it uses this server software, we are able to take advantage of the OSG&#39;s accounting system.  The system, Gratia, has a plugin which monitors the Globus !GridFTP logs and reports any transfer data to a central collector.  The version of Gratia probe covered in this guide is compatible with Hadoop 0.20.2. 

The instructions on this page must be followed for every !GridFTP server on Hadoop.

---+ Prerequisites

This page assumes:

   1 You have a working Hadoop install as documented in [[Hadoop20Installation][this guide]].
   1 You have a working !GridFTP install on top of Hadoop, [[Hadoop20GridFTP][as documented here]].

%STARTSECTION{&quot;Prereqs&quot;}%

The Gratia probe requires the file =osg-user-vo-map.txt= to exist and be up to date. We provide an rpm package that takes care of creating and updating this file as needed.  To get it run:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-user-vo-map-cron
&lt;/pre&gt;

It will pull in the =gums-client= rpm as a dependency.  Details on setting up =osg-user-vo-map-cron= are below.

%ENDSECTION{&quot;Prereqs&quot;}%

---+ YUM Installation

To configure your local installation for the yum repository, [[Hadoop20Installation#Installing_with_yum][follow the advice here]] to install the =osg-hadoop-20= package for your site.

After installing the osg-hadoop-20 yum configuration package, you can install the Gratia probe with:

%STARTSECTION{&quot;Install&quot;}%

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install gratia-probe-gridftp-transfer
&lt;/pre&gt;

Updates can be installed with:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum upgrade gratia-probe-gridftp-transfer
&lt;/pre&gt;

%ENDSECTION{&quot;Install&quot;}%

---+ Configuration

%STARTSECTION{&quot;Config&quot;}%

This RPM *does not* use Linux-standard file locations.  Here are the most relevant file and directory locations:

| Purpose | Needs Editing? | Location |
| Probe Configuration | Yes | /opt/vdt/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig |
| Probe Executables | No | /opt/vdt/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer |
| Log files | No | /opt/vdt/gratia/var/logs |
| Temporary files | No | /opt/vdt/gratia/var/tmp |
| Gums configuration | Yes | /etc/gums/gums-client.properties |

The RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it.  The configuration of the probe is controlled by the file

&lt;verbatim&gt;
/opt/vdt/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

This is usually one XML node spread over multiple lines.  Note that comments (#) have no effect on this file.  You will need to edit the following:

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| !ProbeName | Maybe | This should be set to &quot;gridftp-transfer:&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;&quot;, where &amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt; is the fully-qualified domain name of your gridftp host. |
| !CollectorHost | Maybe | Set to the hostname and port of the central collector.  By default it sends to the OSG collector.  See below. |
| !SiteName | Yes | Set to the resource group name of your site as registered in OIM. |
| !GridftpLogDir | Yes | Set to /var/log, or wherever your current gridftp logs are located |
| !Grid | Maybe | Set to &quot;ITB&quot; if this is a test resource; otherwise, leave as OSG. |
| !UserVOMapFile | Yes | Set to the location of your osg-user-vo-map.txt; see below for information about this file. |
| !SuppressUnknownVORecords| Maybe | Set to 1 to suppress any records that can&#39;t be matched to a VO; 0 is strongly recommended. |
| !SuppressNoDNRecords | Maybe | Set to 1 to suppress records that can&#39;t be matched to a DN; 0 is strongly recommended. |
| !EnableProbe | Yes | Set to 1 to enable the probe. |

---%SHIFT%++ Selecting a collector host

The collector is the central server which logs the !GridFTP transfers into a database.  There are usually three options:

   1 *OSG Transfer Collector*: This is the primary collector for transfers in the OSG.  Use !CollectorHost=&quot;gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org:80&quot;.
   1 *OSG-ITB Transfer Collector*: This is the test collector for transfers in the OSG.  Use !CollectorHost=&quot;gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org:8881&quot;.
   1 *Site local collector*: If your site has set up its own collector, then your admin will be able to give you an endpoint to use.  Typically, this is along the lines of !CollectorHost=&quot;collector.example.com:8880&quot;.

---%SHIFT%++ Generating osg-user-vo-map.txt

The =osg-user-vo-map.txt= is a simple, space-separated format that contains 2 columns; the first is a unix username and the second is the VO which that username correspond to.  In order to create it you must install the =osg-user-vo-map-cron= rpm as mentioned above.  Once =osg-user-vo-map-cron= is installed you need to configure the gums client.

The primary configuration file for the gums-client utilities is located in =/etc/gums/gums-client.properties=.  The two properties that you must change are:

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| gums.location | Yes | This should be set to the admin URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.location=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin |
| gums.authz | Yes | This should be set to the authorization interface URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.authz=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort |

After =osg-user-vo-map-cron= is installed and the gums client is configured =osg-user-vo-map.txt= should be created in the following location:

&lt;verbatim&gt;/etc/grid-security/osg-user-vo-map.txt&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Make sure the *UserVOMapFile* field is set to this location in

&lt;verbatim&gt;/opt/vdt/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Without =osg-user-vo-map.txt= , all gridftp transfers will show up as belonging to the VO &quot;Unknown&quot;.

%ENDSECTION{&quot;Config&quot;}%

---+ Validation

%STARTSECTION{&quot;Validation&quot;}%

Run the Gratia probe once by hand to check for functionality:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /opt/vdt/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/gridftp-transfer_meter.cron.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

Look for any abnormal termination and report it if it is a non-trivial site issue.  Look in the log files in =/opt/vdt/gratia/var/logs/&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;.log= and make sure there are no error messages printed.
