4100-4115 - dCache gsidcap authorization bug (#2169). Current state is developer testing.
4679 - SRM caching leading to inconsistent results on Fermilab Public dCache. Users can not write to their designated storage location. No update.
4466 - Java version of G-U-C against gridftp server at AGLT2 failing. No update.
4472 - Unable to retrieve files using srmcp (dCache 1.7) immediately, once it has been copied successfully.DESY ticket (#2473). No update


Another dcache.org ticket submitted by Tanya was discussed. Messages from gPlazma timeout before being acted on by gridftpdoor, even when the load is not heavy. It was decided to let dcache.org act on this, likely to require instrumenting of cell messaging. An experiment of increasing the timeout for the particular message being reported will be tried.

Tanya reported that she tested a patch of the Gratia probes supplied by Gregory Sharp, and the tests were OK. An rpm can be built when Greg has checked the new code into CVS.

Ted reported that the test of the dCache GIP did not succeed. Ted and Neha will meet with Brian for a walk-through of the test on Friday

Ted went over developments related to storage from the All Hands Meeting last week in Raleigh.

Future work of OSG Storage was discussed in general terms. Ted will discuss the proposed work with Management and create a new Gantt chart.
