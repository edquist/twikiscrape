---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
OU_OCHEP_SWT2 problems
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
OU_OCHEP_SWT2 site administrators (Horst and Karthink) have  reported multiple problems during the last week:
   1. Authorization failure for a particular user (could not reproduce for the time being) 
   1. FTS lcg-ls timeouts BNL-&gt; OU (unsolved)
   1. !BeStMan failure  (increased java heap and #of threads)

OU is running !BeStMan-gateway/Lustre. FTS transfer request is setup to request adler32 checksum to be dynamically calculated, this is done on !BeStMan server and multiple simultaneous requests are causing a huge load on !BeStMan server. Actions:
   * Karthik will talk with Luster support to see if they are missing something in configuration
   * Tanya will talk to other ATLAS and CMS sites to see if anybody has experienced the same problems
