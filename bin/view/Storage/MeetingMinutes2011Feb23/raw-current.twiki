Jeff:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
two weeks report:

Hadoop RPMs:
- I emailed osg-hadoop@fnal.gov asking all sys admins if anyone still requires rhel 4 / sl 4 support for Hadoop 0.20.  
  No one objected to dropping support.
- Michael copied bestman 1.3.18 and bestman2 2.0.5 to 0.19 stable repository
- Michael put updated osg-ca-certs package in 0.19 hadoop testing repository. He wants us to test it, then he will copy it over to 0.19 stable.
- Michael created rpm to configure yum to use 0.20 testing repository:
               http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/2.0/rhel5/x86_64/osg-hadoop-20-1.el5.noarch.rpm
    He also noted that since we do not yet have a stable 0.20 repo, after installing this rpm you must install packages using
              yum --enablerepo hadoop-testing install ...
     to pull from the test repository.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
