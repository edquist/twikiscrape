&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
!BeStMan/Hadoop performance testing in UCSD

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

UCSD has !BeStMan-gateway/Hadoop installation of ~ 200TB. UCSD has participated  in testing of the scalability of !BeStMan.  According to the tests a single !BeStMan server could sustain processing rate of  200Hz .  They have also performed separate tests  running physics application that is very I/O intensive. For this test worker nodes were HDFS data servers as well. The results were promising.

 Igor will provide more information about his plans for performance and scalability testing next  week.

---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Storage discovery tools status 

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Ted is working with !MyOSG team. He is trying to understand how they extract information from bdii and map it to !MyOSG. They are discussing the way to replace the current procedure with discovery tools.



---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Progress with SCEC, LIGO (Ted)

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Ted has met with Dan Katz and discussed the steps that are needed for SCEC to use opportunistic storage. Mats is working with graduate student to start the process. 

LIGO has sent the list of data they are fetching from !MyOSG. It looks like it would not be too hard to extract missing information by using discovery tools.
 

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of the test stand after kernel upgrade (Andrew, Neha, Tanya)

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
   1. !BeStMan/Xrootd restarted without any problems.
   1. Hadoop didn&#39;t start. Andrew has modified ckconfig and send Michael an email proposing to include ckconfig in installation instructions
   1. dcache
After kernel update and reboot we have lost /diskc/local  on one of the pool nodes (gwdca01). After loosing one pool  all the attempts to copy any file to dcache ended up with the following error: &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
&quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; org.globus.ftp.exception.ServerException: 
Server refused performing the request. Custom message: Operation 
failed: FTP Door: got response from 
&#39;[&gt;Trash.StoragePoolManager@dCacheDomain:*@dCacheDomain:SrmSpaceManager@srm-
gwdca04Domain:*@srm-gwdca04Domain:*@dCacheDomain]&#39; with error Best 
pool &lt;gwdca02_1&gt; too high : Infinity (error code 1)&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
It was unclear what was the cause for the problem because the admin interface indicated that  there was lot of free space available. 

It turned out that the &quot;gapPara&quot; parameter that defines min amount of free space for cost calculation is set to 4GB  by default (gwdca02 has 3GB of space). 
It is unclear if this is a configurable parameter  (it is not defined in dCacheSetup) but it could be changed via admin interface (set gap command).  
After the change has been made it was possible to copy files but we are still experience problems with space reservation. 
Dan should try to restore the mount when he comes back from vacation.


---++ Fifth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
LCG-utils testing (Tanya)

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Tanya continued to work on new lcg-utils testing, some of the known bugs has been fixed. There were some problems with !BeStMan-fullmode configuration that Alex has helped to debug. Tanya has started the discussion with Iwona who is responsible for !BeStMan-fullmode configuration documentation on OSG twiki and Alex about information we should provide to site administrators so they can configure !BeStMan that will work with lcg commands. There are still some problems with using lcg-cp with space token description and !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd. Tanya is discussing it with Wei and Alex.
