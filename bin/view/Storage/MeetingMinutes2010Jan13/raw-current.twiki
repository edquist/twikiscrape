built gratia storage probes for versions  1.06.13a-1 , 1.06.13b-1 and 1.06.13c-1

added the check that JAVA_LOCATION points to a java binary (as requested by Dave@UIUC) 
and committed changes in CVS

upgraded dcache on gridworks to 1.9.5-11 (had to move pool directories on gwdca01 from 
/usr/local to /scratch as /usr/local is not available anymore) and performed simple transfers 
to validate it

fixed bug in dcache install script which prevented the creation of new pools

more troubleshooting with Chris on gratia transfer probe on UIUC. there was a logical 
bug in probe. this is now resolved
&lt;/pre&gt;

Alex:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
* Support
  - STAR data replication with bestman accessing NERSC HPSS
     Test instance deployed for STAR at lbl.gov
  - NERSC PDSF deployment of bestman for multiple VO requirements
  - srmping failure to bestman within RSV probe at Vanderbilt.
    (ticket 7431 - closed now)

* Release
  - working on bestman2 test and packaging
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tanya:

   ITB meeting - OSG 1.2.5 release

technical work:
     Revised  OSG storage WBS , waiting for Alain and Chander approval to 
update webpage
     Installed/tested
        bestman-fullmode/bestman-gateway/xrootd from OSG
        vdt-dcache 2.4.5 (still some problems with gratia probes)
        
     Provided instructions to Rob Snihur on how to install hadoop/fuse on the worker node
     Found the problem with xrootd/cnsd logs, reported bug to developers 
     Investigating weird behavior of xrootd when the related daemons are restarted 
on the data server during ftp transfer
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
vdt-dcache 2.4.5

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

vdt-dcache 2.4.5 is in testing:
   * dcache-server 1.9.5-11 (dcache current production release)
   * gratia probe  1.06.13c-1 
dcache has passed all the tests but gratia probes are failing, so we will investigate and cut a new release.

The plans for vdt-dcache releases after that one:
   1. new gratia storage probe (collecting data from Information Provider) - in packaging/testing right now
   1. inclusion of chimera, migration procedure from pnfs (in about 3 months)

---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;

New storage dcache probe
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Andrew has discussed all the opened issues with Chris and it looks like the probe is being ready for packaging and testing. Andrew is working on documentation.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Documentation overhaul
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Ted has been working on general layout and reviewing the old documents. The start up page is https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage. 
Most  of the work will be finished in two weeks.

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Bestman 2
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

The release has been delayed due to problems with packaging bestman under tomcat. The current estimate that it will be available for VDT testing in couple of month.

---++ Fifth  agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Scalability test update from Abhishek

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Haifeng&#39;s plan for initial scalability tests:
   1. single datanode bandwidth test with !Gridftp and !FUSE copy respectively
   1. cluster bandwidth test with gridftp with small files and large files
   1. bestman scalability test using lcg-cp and srmls
   1. data access via FUSE, which should include the benchmark of single node test (1-4 jobs in a single node) and cluster test (no less than 8 jobs per datanode)
   1. maybe a fast data transfer (FDT) test can be done as well.


---++ Sixth  agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
SCEC and Fly&#39;s Eye status

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

SCEC:

We have the following update from  Ewa Deelman and Gaurang Mehta:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;/&gt;
Firefly has behaved very well. Though we did not use glideins to use a large number of nodes at one shot which may have not taxed 
the Panasas filesystem enough. When running the same workflows on ranger using glideins we run 2400 tasks in parallel and 
that does tax the Lustre filesystem a bit.

I have some new numbers about files and sizes, runtimes etc updated on the wiki.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Fly&#39;s Eye:

Chris will start transfer to Omaha and Lincoln. We are still looking for sites that could provide 10 TB (5 &amp; 5) for some period of time (up to 1 year)
