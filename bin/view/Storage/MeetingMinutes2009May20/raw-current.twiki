---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of gPlazma problems at UChicago (Ted)
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
UChicago has experienced intermittent gPlazma timeouts after upgrade to dcache 1.9.2-5. According to Rob gPlazma is still talking to an old GUMS, the load is low and usage pattern has not changed.
The following steps have been done in order to mitigate the problem:
   1. saml-vo-mapping-cache-lifetime was set to 180 (from 0)
   1. it was attempted to get rid of gPlazma cell and configure it as a pluggable module within gridftp doors and srm. GridFtp door started successfully, srm failed - Ted has committed a fix, it should be released soon.
   1.  After these actions they still can see occasional timeouts, so it was advised to modify dcachesrm-gplazma.policy and allow the authorization via gridmapfile as well. The priority for grimapfile authorization is set to 1.
 It looks like the timeouts disappeared but still the cause is not clear. We will try to reproduce the problem on our test stand.
