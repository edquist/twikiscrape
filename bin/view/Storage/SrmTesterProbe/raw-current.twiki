---++ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This a page for storage RSV probes.  It includes installation and configuring of optional probes, as well as descriptions of the SRM client probes and of the srm-tester probes.
System administrators can expect to learn how to install RSV as a stand-alone server (or packaged with a CE) as well as how to configure and activate them.

---+++ Applicable Versions

RSV Storage probes will be released in an upcoming VDT release.

---++ Requirements

   * You will need to install Pacman before installing the srm tester RSV probe.
   * Your VDT installation will need to include jdk1.6.   For certain versions of the VDT, the java versions of the srm client and of the VDT are mismatched. If you are getting a &quot;java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError&quot; for the srm-client probes, edit the VDT_LOCATION setup.sh and change JAVA_HOME (and the subsequent path) from jdk1.5 to jdk1.6.



---++ Installing SRM RSV Probes


   1. Install Pacman if you haven&#39;t.
   1. Install RSV from the VDT cache:
   1. Install and update latest certificates

---+++ Installing Pacman

If Pacman is not installed, you will need to install here:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz=
gunzip pacman-latest.tar.gz
tar xvf pacman-latest.tar
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Installing RSV from the VDT Cache

RSV is a package in the VDT.  You will need to install it here.  
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:OSG-RSV
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that this package will also be installed automatically as part of a computing element installation.

---+++ Installing and Updating Certificates

The following commands complete a VDT installation by install and updating certificates for use in contacting storage elements.
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:CA-Certificates-Updater 
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following command (optionally) can be used to enable auto-updating of certificates.
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
vdt-control --enable vdt-update-certs vdt-control --enable fetch-crl vdt-control --on vdt-update-certs vdt-control --on fetch-crl
&lt;/pre&gt;



---++ SRMTester RSV Probe Configuration

After downloading OSG-RSV and all dependencies, you will have a osg-rsv directory. In VDT_LOCATION/setup, there will be a configure-osg-rsv program. You will have run this program in order to configure the probes. I used a script similar to this:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
cd $VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
cd osg-rsv/setup
./configure_osg_rsv --consumer --init --server y --setup-for-apache --user dstrain --srm-probes --srm-uri fgt0x5.fnal.gov:10443 --srm-dir /srmcache/fnalgrid/rsvtest --ce-uri localhost --srm-webservice-path srm/v2/server
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that there are many options to configure (run with --help for a full list). A brief description follows:

|*Option*|*Description*|
|--server y| Needed to add the service to the vdt-control menu|
|--setup-for-apache --consumer| Needed to output to a web-page.|
|--srm-probes| Install all probes of &quot;OSG-SRM&quot; type.|
|--srm-uri| The name and port of the server you want to monitor.  This should be a srm endpoint of a storage element. |
|--srm-dir| A test directory that you have access to on the storage element.  The RSV probes will attempt to test writing to this directory.|
|--user| The user that this probe should run as. This user will need a cert/proxy set up at /tmp/x509up_&lt;uid&gt;|
|--srm-webservice-path| The web service path. srm/v2/server for Bestman. srm/managerv2 for dCache.|
|--ce-uri| A bug in older vdt versions requires RSV to be run on CE nodes. Fake it with &quot;--ce-uri localhost&quot; for stand-alone RSV machines.|

Once you have run this, you should see some files in osg-rsv/submission/probes directory.
Note that you will have to run this once for each host that you wish to monitor. However, it is recommended that you get one running successfully before you enable additional probes.


---+++ Enabling additional probes

The configure_osg_rsv only initializes probes that are set to be enabled by default. The srmclient and srmtester probes are disabled by default. To enable them, you will need to enable them in the config file. In the osg-rsv/config directory, there will be a file for each hostname you have configured (ie. fgt0x5.fnal.gov_metrics.conf). Each probe will be in here in cron-type format.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
on srm-ping-probe@org.osg.srm.srmping 13,33,53 * * * *
off srmclient-probe@org.osg.srm.srmclient-copy 29 * * * *
off srmclient-probe@org.osg.srm.srmclient-get 20 * * * *
off srmclient-probe@org.osg.srm.srmclient-mkdir 5 * * * *
...
&lt;/pre&gt;


Here you can configure which probes are enabled/disabled and how often they run. Be careful about running too much (ie. don&#39;t enable all probes to run every minute as this will overload your machine with jobs). Change any probes from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;on&quot; to enable their configuration. You can also change the timing in the last columns (format: minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week).
After configuring this, you will need to run the configure command again:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
cd ../setup
./configure_osg_rsv --consumer --init --server y --setup-for-apache --user dstrain --srm-probes --srm-uri fgt0x5.fnal.gov:10443 --srm-dir /srmcache/fnalgrid/rsvtest --ce-uri localhost --srm-webservice-path srm/v2/server
&lt;/pre&gt;


You should now see the new probes in the submissions directory.


---+++ Running Metrics (automatically)

Once the probes have been configured (see above), then you need to enable and run them. RSV Probes use condor_cron to coordinate timed events. First, enable condor-cron:


&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
vdt-control --enable condor-cron
vdt-control --on condor-cron
&lt;/pre&gt;


Then, start RSV:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
vdt-control --enable osg-rsv
vdt-control --on osg-rsv
&lt;/pre&gt;


Note that you will have to turn osg-rsv (--off) and then (--on) every time you modify configure_osg_rsv settings.
Once you do so, the script will scan the submission directory and start all probes in condor_cron. It will also start the consumers as well. 


---+++ Validation of SRMTester Probe Operation

You can verify that the probes are running  by running condor_cron_q:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
condor_cron_q
...
29.0 dstrain 5/13 13:27 0+00:00:00 I 0 0.0 probe_wrapper.pl /
30.0 dstrain 5/13 13:27 0+00:00:00 I 0 0.0 probe_wrapper.pl /
31.0 dstrain 5/13 13:27 0+00:00:03 R 0 0.0 probe_wrapper.pl /
32.0 dstrain 5/13 13:27 0+00:00:00 I 0 0.0 rotate_html_files.
33.0 dstrain 5/13 13:27 0+00:00:03 R 0 0.0 html-consumer
34.0 dstrain 5/13 13:27 0+00:00:03 R 0 0.0 gratia-script-cons
34 jobs; 26 idle, 8 running, 0 held=
&lt;/pre&gt;
There should be one probe_wrapper job for each probe that you have enabled (in addition to several other jobs related to the consumer jobs)

The configure script will also modify your httpd.conf in VDT&#39;s apache to serve files from the osg-rsv/output/html directory. You will see something in your apache/conf/extra/vdt-webapps.conf (included from httpd.conf) like:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
# Set options for RSV&#39;s HTML directory
&lt;Directory &quot;/usr/local/vdt-2.0.89-srmtester/osg-rsv/output/html&quot;&gt;
Options None
AllowOverride None
Order Allow,Deny
Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
# Create alias for RSV output directory
Alias /rsv /usr/local/vdt-2.0.89-srmtester/osg-rsv/output/html
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should be able to go to your web server (on port 8443 unless you changed it in httpd.conf in https://server:port/rsv and see the rsv output (takes a few minutes to update after its started).

---+++ Debugging Procedures

Logs for the probes can be found in VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/logs/probes.
Each log is named based on the srm uri endpoint and probe name, such as 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
gw014k1.fnal.gov__srmtester-probe@org.osg.srm.srmtester-push.out
&lt;/pre&gt;
For each enabled probe, there will be a out, log, and err file.

---++ SRM Client Probes

Included in the optional SRM probes are two types of probes.  The first will begin with &quot;org.osg.srm.srmclient-&quot;.
These will use SRM client commands to connect to your storage facility and run commands to check basic 
functionality connected to the SRM storage protocol.  Each probe will return a status:

  * OK (Green): This means the test was successful.
  * Warning (Yellow): This means that the server returned &quot;Not supported&quot;.  This operation does not work, but only because it is not supported by your storage element.
  * Critical (Red):  The test has failed.  Click on the link (in html consumer) for more details.

These probes have to use either the Fermi SRM client (srmping, srmcp, etc) or the lbnl client (srm-ping, srm-copy, etc).  
If the probe is failing because it is using the wrong type, you may have to specify the &quot;srm-client-type&quot; option in the configure line above.

Description of the functionality for each probe is below:

   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-copy:* Tests a SRM copy operation on the remote server.  First, uploads a file using srmcp/srm-copy from a local file to a file named like 1274991241-srmclient-probe-test-file-remote.14288 in the remote directory (numbers differ based on time and process id).  It then copies it to a new file called 1274991241-srmclient-probe-test-file-remote.142881274991241-srmclient-probe-test-file-remote.14288.copy.  It uses a srmls/ssrm-ls to verify that the copy has occurred.  Lastly, it performs a srmrm/srm-rm to clean up both copies.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-get:* Tests SRM copy to get a file from the server.  Use srmcp/srm-copy to copy a file to the remote server.  Use srmcp/srm-copy to retrieve the file from the server.  Compares the two copies using the unix diff command.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-mkdir:*  This command uses srmmkdir/srm-mkdir to create a directory on the storage element.  It uses srmls/srm-ls to verify that the directory exist.  The cleanup uses srm-rmdir/srm-rmdir to remove the temporary directory.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-rmdir:* This command uses srmmkdir/srm-mkdir to create a directory, then uses srmrmdir/srm-rmdir to delete it.  It uses srmls/srm-ls to verify both that the directory was created and then that it also was later removed.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-mv:* Tests the srmmv or srm-mv command.  This first copies a file to the storage element using srmcp/srm-copy.  It then moves it to a new name using srmmv/srm-mv.  It then uses srmrm/srm-rm to clean both the old name and new name off the server (in case the mv failed).
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-ping:* Pings a server using srmping/srm-ping.  Uses the exit status to verify whether the command was successful.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-put:* Tests srmcp/srm-copy.  Put a file onto the server using srmcp/srm-copy, then use srmls/srm-ls to verify that the file was copied successfully.  Lastly, srmrm/srm-rm is used to clean this file off the storage element.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-reservespace:* Test srm-reserve-space command to reserve a space.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-releasespace:* Test srm-reserve-space then srm-reserve-space it.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmclient-rm:* Use srmcp/srm-copy to copy a file to the server then remove it using srmrm/srm-rm.  Use srmls/srm-ls to verify the file has been removed.

---++ SRM tester Probes


Included in the optional SRM probes are two types of probes.  The second will begin with &quot;org.osg.srm.srmtester-&quot;.
These will use the Bestman &quot;srm-tester&quot; command to connect to your storage facility and run commands to check basic 
functionality connected to the SRM storage protocol.  Each probe will return a status:

  * OK (Green): This means the test was successful.
  * Warning (Yellow): This means that the server returned &quot;Not supported&quot;.  This operation does not work, but only because it is not supported by your storage element.
  * Critical (Red):  Either the test failed, or it was not tested, due to a dependent operation failing (i.e. if a put fails, then there is no file to get).  Click on the link (in html consumer) for more details.

Each probe runs one &quot;operation&quot;, which corresponds to a common task, such as getting a file.  Each test calls srm-tester with a different value in the &quot;-op&quot; parameter.  Some of these operations actually comprise multiple SRM commands or tests, so it is possible that one test fails, causing the subsequent tests to be not completed.  This would register as a failure.  In the case of a &quot;critical&quot; result, you can view the details, which will include a summary of all commands performed, and which have failed.  It will also show the detailed output of the srm-tester, which may give some clues as to why the operation failed.

Description of the functionality for each probe is below:


   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-bringonline:* Test bringonline functionality.  This test will put a file, try to bring it to ONLINE latency, then will remove it.  This operation uses the following SRM operations:srmPrepareToPut, srmStatusOfPutRequest, gsiftp-put, srmPutDone, srmBringOnline, srmStatusOfBringOnlineRequest, srmLs, srmRm.  This test will only succeed if the srmBringOnline operation succeeds.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-get:*  Test getting a file from the server.  This will put a file on the server, then get it using gsiftp.  It uses the SRM operations: srmPrepareToPut, srmStatusOfPutRequest, gsiftp-put, srmPutDone, srmPrepareToGet, srmStatusOfGetRequest, gsiftp-get, srmReleaseFiles, srmLs, srmRm.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-getspacemeta:* This operation tests getting the meta-data attributes of a reserved space.  It reserves a space, then gets the meta-data, then releases the space.  It uses srmReserveSpace, srmGetSpaceMetadata, srmReleaseSpace.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-getspacetokens:* This operation tests retrieving space tokens.  It uses the following SRM functionality: srmReserveSpace, srmGetSpaceTokens, srmReleaseSpace
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-gettransferprotocols:*  This tests the srmGetTransferProtocols operation.  It should return all valid protocols for returning data.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-gsiftp:*  This tests getting a file via the gsiftp protocol.  It uses srmPrepareToPut, srmStatusOfPutRequest, gsiftp-put, srmPutDone, srmLs, srmRm, srmCopy-pull-gsiftp, srmStatusOfCopyRequest-pull-gsiftp.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-ls:*  This tests browsing a directory.  It uses the srmLs functionality.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-mkdir:*  This tests making a directory on the remote storage element.  This uses the operations srmMkdir and srmRmdir.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-mv:* This tests moving a file from one location to a different location while on the remote storage element.  This operation actually calls srm-tester twice.  The first it calls with the operation put, in order to first prepare a file on the remote storage,  It then calls with the operation mv, which uses the srmMv, then srmRm to clean-up.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-ping:*  This operation pings a server to see if it responds.  It only uses the srmPing operation.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-pull:* This tests getting a file in &quot;pull&quot; mode.  This uses srmCopy-pull and srmStatusOfCopyRequest-pull.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-push:* This tests putting a file onto the remote storage in &quot;push&quot; mode.  This uses srmCopy-push and srmStatusOfCopyRequest-push.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-put:*  This tests copying a file onto the remote storage.  It uses a srmls in order to verify it.  The operations used are srmPrepareToPut, srmStatusOfPutRequest, gsiftp-put., srmPutDone, srmLs, srmRm.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-release:*  This tests releasing a reserved space.  First, it must reserve a space where the release operation can be tested.  It uses srmReserveSpace, srmReleaseSpace.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-reserve:*  This tests reserving a space on the storage element with which to put files.  This tests the srmReserveSpace operation.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-rmdir:*  This tests removing a directory from the storage element.  It will need to create a directory first..  This uses the operations srmMkdir and srmRmdir.
   * *org.osg.srm.srmtester-srmrm:*  This tests removing a file from the storage element.  It will first copy a file to the server for testing.

For more information, see the Bestman srm-tester documentation.
