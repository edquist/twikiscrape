---+Next Storage Technical Group Meeting: 11/28/06

---++ Agenda

Discuss Use Cases of Storage on the OSG:  These will help us formulate our management model.

---++ Storage Use Case Motivation
OSG 2006, people raised issues about in general how to use storage on OSG. Discussion today will focus on getting the information gathering process:

---++ List of Suggestions

Options   
   * Timely availability of storage   
   * Security Policies. Where am I authorized to access storage? Also, read/write permission may differ given different VO&#39;s. Could the gPLAZMA framework be used?
   * Mechanism of cataloguing: Real use cases for solutions on this issue. Whether it&#39;s hashtables or other solutions.
   * User driven: From the perspective of a manager who wants to present a high level talk. You probably want to see Integrated plots of storage use over all of OSG. What kind of throughput you get. Who uses what.       
   * Estimate on storage requirements for a particular job. This is similar to the work done on compute nodes. At least you want to see a crude feedback such as which storage system is up and how much space is available and what&#39;s an estimated time of storage space available.
   * A good feel for stability/instability is probably needed to be shown for srm related systems.
   * Physical location maps of storage resources on OSG
   * Usability of a SE can depend on lot of physical attributes inter- and intra-VO. Depending on the environment at any given time, SEs may perform differently. 
   * Which protocols does a SE support.
   * Is there a best practice guideline? For example, if I am going to put a file on tape, I should probably have large file size. All this information would need to be represented in different ways, text/charts/pictures
   * What kind of client programs you would need to use a SE.
   * Historical data on SE performance could help users select the right kind of SE.       
   * Troubleshooting information on different SE. Trouble shooting probe scripts could be very useful.
   * Performance benchmarks for different use cases. Trade off information between different SE solutions would be extremely useful information.


Here is an initial attempt to begin to organize and categorize this list.  In the following table includes usage of these time related
concepts -

| *Historical* | Information including past performance, may not include up-to-the-minute information |
| *Recent* | Information which may include the recent past, but may not include up-to-the-minute information |
| *Real Time* | Information which includes up-to-the-minute information and may include Recent information |



| *Use Case* | *By Whom* | *Format* | *Timeliness* |
| Management needs meeting info: Performance, Throughput, VO usage... | Management, Conference Attendees | Plots, ... | Historical, Recent |
| What kinds of storage are available : Cache, Permanent, where... | Users | Documentation | Recent | 
| Where is OSG available storage located? | Users | Documentation | Recent |
| What is the status of the OSG available storage? | Users, Admins, Managers | Visual Display | Real Time |
| What is the current rate on/off of OSG available storage? | Users, Admins, Managers | Visual Display | Historical, Recent | 
| What are the policies (e.g. access, how much storage...) in force for OSG available storage: by OSG, by the site? | Users, Admins, Managers | Documentation | Recent |
| Which storage systems support which protocols? | Users | Documentation | Recent |
| Where is my request for data? | Users | ??? | Real Time |
| What are the best practices for using the storage (e.g. file size)? | Users, Admins | Documentation | Recent |
| What functionality does the client support (e.g. ls, rm) | Users, Admins | Documentation | Recent |
| What clients do I need? From where? Installation? | Users, Admins | Documentation | Recent |
| Where are the bottlenecks? At a site? At a regular time? | Users, Admins | Visual Display | Historical, Recent |
| Something is wrong with my transfer, what can I do? | Users, Admins | Documentation, Troubleshooting scripts | Recent |
| Once on storage, how can I get catalog information? | Users | Documentation | Recent |
| How long will my storage request take? | Users | API or CLI | Real Time (Approximate) |
| How does the storage perform generally?  Benchmarks? | Users, Admins, Managers | Visual Display | Historical | 

 There are several questions that arise from looking at this.  
   1. Who provides this information, scripts, plots, ...?
   1. How is the information kept up to date?
   1. Is there a standard protocol for getting this information from storage systems?
   1. Who monitors the information to make sure it is up-to-date


 Also we should organize this information and then get a feedback from srm developers to find out the priorities assigned to each of these issues.
