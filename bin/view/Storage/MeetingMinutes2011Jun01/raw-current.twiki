Alex:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
 - Email discussions on SRM interop testing
 - Support for STAR experiment on timed-out gridftp transfers (managed by bestman) from NERSC to BNL
 - added network connection related exception handling on bestman-client
 - support on bestman2 2.0.13 release candidate
&lt;/pre&gt;

Doug:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- xrootd: 3.0.4 not out yet.  Still RC1
- bestman: Working on building bestman2 from source for VDT repo.  Should have rpm out later this week.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Jeff:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Hadoop 0.20 RPMs 
- failed attempting to build Bestman2 2.0.13 rpm.  Fails on make missing java extensions: jaxp_parser_impl, xml-commons-apis.
- Brian had similar problems for 2.0.12.  Creating the source tarball using configure script makes build dependent on initial download location.  Further investigation is needed to determine if I&#39;m having the same problem.

Documentation
- working on the layout on https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Hadoop20Install.
- need to figure out how much to include in subsections for installing each component
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- Went through MOCK documentation. 
Had issues bringing up cloud vm for mock build testing (Thanks Faarooq for his help). Finally came up. 
Mock prerequisites are setup (Thanks to Doug for his help). 
Able to initialize the mock environment --- however reports several missing dependencies..in progress
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tanya&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- discussed changes in bestman configuration script for pacman &amp; rpm
- installed bestman2.0.13 from rpm (hdfs repo and vdt repo) and pacman, tested configuration modification, provided feedback - not ready for ITB yet
- re-installed and test fixed prima rpm, updated documentation 
- installed gratia probes from hdfs repo, provided feedback - missing rpms, questionable  dependencies,etc
- contacted Lukasz and xrootd developers in order to understand the delay with release 
- support
&lt;/pre&gt;
