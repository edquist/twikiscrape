---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
!BeStMan-gateway static space tokens and Hadoop quotas
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Tanya has configured !BeStMan-HDFS with static token and  tested Andrew&#39;s script that calculates used space. It seems that !BeStMan-gateway is working fine and one could use space token to write to a specific area in HDFS that has quota. It is weird that !BeStMan starts copy even if UnsedSpace is equal to 0 and copy failed during !GridFtp transfer. We have to discuss it with Alex.
The other encountered problem during the test was stake trace produced by hadoop client command due to permissions set for hadoop central log. Tanya has changed permissions for now.

Michael will package the script as a separate rpms. He also gave some advice how to reconfigure hadoop to disable client logging.
He has promised to add warning to documentation for !BeStMan installation from rpm.
