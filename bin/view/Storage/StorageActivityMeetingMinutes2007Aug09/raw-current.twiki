---+++ Discussion
The format of the test plan document was discussed. The main sections of the document will be:

Document ID. VSE (validation for storage element) followed by feature number and document version, e.g., VSE-4-1.0
Document Name. Can be determined by author.
Target Software including Version numbers
Overview
Goals/Notes
Test Conditions. Hardware (including netword bandwidth), Load, etc.  Each may refer to an external document.
Test Configuration. For each client (including version) and for the server - startup parameters.
Table of tests. Four columns; ID (name and test number0, Description, Expected Result, Verification Procedure. For ID purposes each row and column is numbered and if a cell has multiple entries, each will be numbered. For example, if the first test is checking for exisistence of the billiing database and there were more than one verification steps, then the second verification step would have an ID of VSE-4-1.0-1.4.2.
Change log. Table with version, date, author, and comments.

Neha will do a web search to find possible refinements to the scheme.

Ted described the workflow. From a developer or support staff a test plan document is created. From the test plan, scripts are written for both the client (initiate the test) and server (verify test results). Therefore the test plan must be written in sufficent detail to serve as a requirements document, and test code should be annotated with the test IDs that being implemented. Scripts are deployed to the test stand and are run, possibly as cron jobs. Unformatted reports are generated by the serverside scripts. A separate process formats them and delivers them into a central repository.   A web server displays the reports, which have links back to the test plan document for reference purposes.

Tanya will write test scripts for basic client transfers and the Replica Manager. Neha will write test scripts for the Billing Cell.

Software frameworks to support the above workflow were discussed. Ted demonstrated Inca.  The consensus was that RES is too narrow in scope for the above purposes.
