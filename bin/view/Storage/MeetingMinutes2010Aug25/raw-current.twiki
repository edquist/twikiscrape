---++ Status Report
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Alex:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
* Support
  - bestman2 scalability
  - bestman2 documentation
  - bestman2 use case testing
  - Null VOMS extension: https://savannah.cern.ch/support/index.php?115538
&lt;/pre&gt;

Doug:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- Created gsiftp plugin for Bestman
- Minor pigeon updates and helping LIGO with pigeon tools
- Public Storage design discussions.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- sevalidation testsuite - troubleshooted foreign key constraint 
failure exception when inserting request in database. now 
investigating another exception.
- followed up with Suchandra on result of his vdt-dcache testing
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ted:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Worked on Design Document for OSG Public Storage. 
Downloaded and built Bestman reference implementation. 
The recommended jar files were wrong, but I got the service working, though only with LBL clients. 
The SRM methods I tested return &quot;not implemented&quot; to the client, which is
correct since they are only stubs. 
Started working on Discovery Tool presentation for CHEP 2010 and OSG Public Storage presentation for OSG
Storage Forum.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tanya:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Meetings:
      LIGO task group
      T3 coordinators meeting
      public storage design

Technical work:
      reinstalled all BeStMan/Xrootd, clients from the latest ITB release, ran tests
      reviewed several documents in OSG twiki, provided feedback
      continued working on OSG storage forum
      worked with LIGO to identify SEs that satisfied the requirements, submitted several tickets to GOC
      discussed improvements for pigeon and discover tools
      released vdt-dcache 3.0.3 in production, updated web page
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Public storage 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
   * Derek has presented the overview of discussion about !REDNet usage as a public storage appliances. It looks like it is an interesting idea  but there are multiple important issues that should be addressed before this could be seriously considered, several of them are listed below
      * security
      * sites willingness to participate
      * space allocation control
   * Chander has indicated that the major stakeholders have approved requirement document and  we should continue to work on design. Ted is  working on a new version of the document.  
   * Doug has written and tested BeStMan plugin for transfer servers selection. It can be useful if we decide to go with  !BeStMan for public storage. Plugin may be also beneficial for several sites that want to define their own selection policy rather than use round robin implemented in !BeStMan, Doug is planning to implement a specific plugin that Horst has requested (selection of gridftp server based on matching of the path in user&#39;s request to a specific partition). Horst is willing to test it on OUHEP_OSG.
---++ Second agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Pigeon tools 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
   * Doug has checked in to VDT svn the pigeon tools as rsv probes. We will have to wait until Scot finishes the RSV code review and major modifications.
   * Tanya and Doug  helped LIGO to install and run pigeon tools. It is really helpful to identify problems and misconfigurations of the SE for a particular VO. The problems we have discovered have been fixed by the sites very quickly. We have now identified couple of new SEs that are available to store LIGO&#39;s images.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
vdt-dcache status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We  have released vdt-dcache 3.0.3 to production. Brian said that the new gratia transfer probes installed by Tier1 sites (BNL and Fermi) have drastically decreased load on gratia collector. We are planning to continue  vdt-dcache releases with new dcache server  in 1.9.5 (Golden) series until we get requests from sites to move on to 1.9.9 or higher.
