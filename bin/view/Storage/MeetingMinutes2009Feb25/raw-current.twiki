---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dCache1.9.2 release status 

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We have tested 1.9.2-3 dCache release. A new vdt-dcache package with  dcache 1.9.2-3 ,pnfs-postgresql-3-1-12-2f-i386 and postgresql-8.3.5 has been created. It was installed on one node (fapl118) and  has passed all the certification tests and authorization interoperability tests except authorization with LCG SCAS server. It turned out that dCache rpm doesn&#39;t contain the latest jar related to the authorization. We have notified dCache team, hopefully 1.9.2-4 will be released next week. ITB is waiting to test this package with new and old GUMS WS.   

We will need to write detailed instructions for pnfs and postgres upgrade. We should ask several sites to test them out before releasing it to VDT. It was proposed to ask Abhishek to try it  on some test installation.
