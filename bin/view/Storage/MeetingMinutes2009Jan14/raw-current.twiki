---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dCache release status

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
dCache 1.9.2-0 is scheduled to be released this week. The major concerns are new Pool code and upgrade procedure from 1.8.15. 

---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
gratia transfer probe status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

There is a request from OSG to expedite  release of new version of gratia transfer probes. We were planning to release dcache transfer probe together with dcache 1.9.2. Now we will need to test the probe with 1.8.15 and release just gratia dcache rpms so admins could do an upgrade. Tanya will start testing new release tomorrow. The major feature of this release is introduction of max billing history period so on first start up probe doesn&#39;t not send all billing records to a collector. 

Brian has to test the latest fixes made by Andrew for gridftp transfer. He will do it ASAP.
Brian is planning to advertise grdiftp probe to CMS Tier-2 admin as soon as new versions are available.
Alex has provided contact information of administrators that may be interested to install gridftp probes for BeStMan Gridftp servers. 
  
---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
BeStMan status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Alex is planning to release bug fixes BeStMan version during next couple of weeks. Tanya asked about lbnl client performance comparing to srm fermi client. Alex explained that the performance can be tuned up by using  various client options. 

Discussed the availability of xrootd monitoring tools - Alex is not aware of any, we are waiting to hear from developers.

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
D0 and CDF storage utilization status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Abhishek&#39;s report:

For D0: 
Purdue SE is still posing problems. Jobs have also started to fail at AGL2-MSU. Any help from OSG Storage will be very helpful. Joel,
D0 MC lead, will be in weekly VO forum tomorrow - you are welcome to
join.

On CDF:
 I plan to restart the effort next week. CDF staff was on travel the last we heard.
----------------------
Tanya has asked to include Joel into conversation and to provide more details about the failures. 

From email we have received from Joel it looks like Purdue problems are not really related to SE:
 &quot;Any investigation of problems at MSU SE will have to wait until high
priority physics analysis calculations are complete. MC jobs have been
preempted by the demands of the conference season.  I&#39;ve been told this
may last 2 or 3 more weeks.

There seem to be a number of problems at Purdue for D0 jobs none of
which are related to SE issues.&quot;
