Prepared and gave talk on Discovery Tool to Site Coordinators meeting
and Colombia Grid Workshop. 

Fixed command for finding SE mount points on CEs. 

Tested first pacman install of discovery tool. Tool is now working from pacman 
install, though there may be some minor fixes resulting from STG testing.

Updated SCEC workflow info and Opportunistic Storage for SCEC page. 
Participated in conference call for SCEC on OSG. I will be Ewa&#39;s contact
on the project for storage issues.

Working with Timur on investigating why gPlazma seems slow with GUMS
callouts.

* Support
  - support for westgrid.ca user accessing bestman at SLAC
    * update the globus cryptix lib to the newer
  - srm-copy not runing with JRE 1.6 at NERSC
    * remove an unused java package that caused class not found error

* srm-client 2.2.1.3.3 release
  - fix srm-copy for unused java package
  - fixes -help and -version caused by the above fix.
  - not critical to include in VDT release, and will be included in the
next one with other fixes.

  Technical work:
        Installed new release of bestman with several modifications of configuration script
        Helped LQCD with configuring gratia  transfer probes
        Investigated problems reported by Rob Snihur on  our Xrootd test stand
        Installed discovery tools from VDT - reported directory permission problem
        Installed xrootd on ATLAS T3 cluster, have written &quot;step-by-step&quot; guide
        Installed BeStMan-gateway , verified guide written by D. Benjamin
        Updated WBS for FY3, mapped major OSG stakeholder requirements for storage with FY4 WBS 
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
vdt-dcache release status
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Neha was working on modifying our installation script in order to comply with new pool creation mechanism in dcache. 

Ted is investigating slow gPlazma performance in dcache.

Timur has advised to use newly  released 1.9.5-5 dcache-server version that has fixed the problems with large files &amp; !PnfsManager
---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
SCEC  meeting summary (Ted)
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Ted has updated [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/OpportunisticStorageForSCEC][the web page] dedicated to SCEC opportunistic storage usage.

The current status:
   * Purdue - will install Bestman SE for SCEC.
   * Caltech - compute resources have been set aside for non-CMS use. 
   * U of Oklahoma - will install Bestman when new hardware arrives.
   * U of Nebraska-Omaha - accepting test uploads and test jobs from Engage.
   * U of Florida - will adding Lustre SE info to BDII. A few more attributes are still needed.
   * Engage - Have uploaded a data set to Omaha. Trying to run jobs to unpack it.
   * OSG Storage - Dialog with Mats about strategy of unpacking tarball. Zip files are a possible alternative. It is not clear that effort from SCEC would be available to change their software. 
   * Ewa will run her existing tests, which have Pegasus moving a small SCEC dataset to the local execution site using GridFTP and direct posix I/O for reading the dataset from a shared file system on the compute nodes, using the Nebraska Omaha site. Once this is working to understand  /evaluate use of Bestman SRM by Pegasus workflows on the Omaha site; support should already be in Pegasus for the LIGO application.
   * Ruth will talk to Dan Katz to have student working on &quot;submit site&quot; port come to Fermilab to give us a tutorial on what is going on and to establish &quot;ownership&quot; of the work across OSG and TG between Dan, Mats, Ewa and the science group - Phil Maetlin, Scott Callaghan.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Xrootd storage probes and general gratia  storage probe requirements 

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Brian is in the process of writing storage probe for Hadoop. We will need to understand the requirements in order to modify dcache storage probe. We need to decide who will be writing xrootd probes.
We agreed to discussed the details next week when Brian comes to Fermilab. Andrew will work on dcache storage probes.

Tickets
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
not tickets report - Neha is sick. 

Ted will contact Mats about [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7636][ticket]] - request from a Berkeley student who is trying to
run searches on fast radio transients.

Tanya will try to organize meeting with Britta, [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7615][the ticket]] she has opened 2 weeks ago is still unresolved
