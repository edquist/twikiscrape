---+++ Discussion

Discussion with Flavia Donna and Greig Cowan on testing and interoperability with respect to SRM v2.2 deployment was held. Ted gave an introduction to OSG Storage Activities. Neha described the OSG Gridworks and UCSD test stands and what testing is currently being done. Copies are being done between Gridworks and UCSD from six clients, and the UCSD is also and endpoint for some Phedex transfers. Flavia mentioned that the latter was valuable in terms of using srmv1 in dCache 1.8; GSSD has been testing v2.2 only. GSSD will be appraised of the result of the tests, as well as the Gridworks tests.

Glue schema 1.3 was discussed and it was agreed that the focus should be on making it work in practice. Flavia will adjust the sample glue schema based on the formula developed by OSG earlier this year. Ted will verify that the information needed for several use cases can be extracted. The use cases have not been fully identified. There are various candidates, from which a core will be selected. Flavia will forward to Ted current queries on the glue storage entities being made by FTS.

These tickets were discussed:

   * 4115  Tanya       Open             dCache/gPlazma failure with dccp
   * 4116  Tanya      Open             dCache/inconsistent state of dcache after multiple srm-advisory delete
   * 4153 Tanya Open             dCache/Pool throws NullPointerException when p2p copy requested by replica manager
   * 4206  Patricia    Open             dCache Files registered with PNFS but not stored on pool
   * 4207  Dan    Open             dCache Client unable to retrieve files (from certain pools NOT all) which have replicas

   * 4115 is known by the DESY dCache developers. We will continue to track it.
   * 4166 is known by the SRM developers; will track.
   * 4153 may be resolved by 4207. Will check based on the resolution of the latter.
   * 4206 is in progress.
   * 4207 identified as a bug. We will track the fix.

Load from fapl clients will be increased to attempt to overload the Gridworks system. An SRM queue to serve as a metric for the load will be identified (later found to be the &quot;Ready&quot; queue, which would grow if the doors are overloaded).

The postgres install script will be modified to use the localhost connection only.
