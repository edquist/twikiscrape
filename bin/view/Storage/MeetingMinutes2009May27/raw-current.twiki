---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of gPlazma problems at UChicago and Indiana (voms validation) (Ted)
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
There was no update from UChicago, so it looks like enabling gridmapfile authorization has fixed the problem. It is obviously not an optimal solution, we will have to try to reproduce time outs problem on the test stand.
Sarah had to disable voms validation, Ted is looking into the problem. He cannot reproduce it locally.

The fixes for gPlazma deployment as a module in srm have been submitted and approved, so they should be included into the next release.

---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Status of vdt-dcache configuration script, inclusion of toolkit (Neha)
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Neha is re-factoring the vdt-installation script. The modification of configuration file will be now required for dcache installation script instead of running interactive script and answering questions. dcache-core-toolkit and dcache-chronicle rpm will be included in release and automatically configured. She is hoping to have it ready for testing before June 15th.

Tanya has installed chronicle on gwdca06 and have tested it. Minor problems have been reported to Abhishek.


---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
 Hadoop installation on gwd0[15-18]k[2-3] (Andrew)
 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

!BeStMan-gateway, !GridFTP-HFS, HFS are installed, basic tests are working fine (see https://gw014k0.fnal.gov:8443/validation_tests).  There were several issues with configuration (Andrew will send email with details). We are probably be able to use the test cluster for STEP 09 stress test. Rob Snihur (CMS Tier-3 coordinator)  is in process of figuring out how to participate and is interested to use our bestman/hadoop test stand.

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
OSG Storage discovery (Ted)?
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Ted was preoccupied with gPlazma problems. There were not a lot of feedback to OSG Storage discovery proposal. Will discuss with Matt how to proceed.
