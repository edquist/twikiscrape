---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
!BeStMan/HDFS rpms

&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Jeff is now able to build hdfs rpms, still has problems with !BeStMan. Waiting for the instructions from Brian and Michael.  He will start working on the documentation.
 

---++ Second agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;

Pigeon/storage rsv probes
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Doug and Scot continued work on improving pigeon as rsv probe. Scot added -no-ping option and provided skeleton for !HtmlConsumer and vdt-control.
Doug was able to modify consumer to display the correct order of the probes and get rid of non-related information. More work on vdt-control is needed. Hopefully will be able to finish before New Year.
  

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
pnfsDump
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Last communication between Paul &amp; Will was on December, 16th. It is unclear if the problem is solved. Neha has updated the ticket. 

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
WBS
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
There are two WBS tasks that we have not addressed last year:
   * Work with Bestman developers to minimize downtime for storage upgrade
   * Work with dCache developers to minimize downtime for storage upgrade 

These tasks were requested by CMS and ATLAS. It is unclear if downtime is still an issue. Neha will contact dcache site admin to collect information. We need to get similar information from site that are running !BeStMan on top of xrootd or hdfs.

---++ Fifth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
space allocation and public storage
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Tanya has installed xrootd storage and transfer probes. It looks like !StorageElement record has enough information about storage space utilization for specific static space token.The HDFS configured with static space tokens and quota has similar information. The question is if we can convince storage administrators to configure bestman and underlying dfs to use static space tokens for public storage.
