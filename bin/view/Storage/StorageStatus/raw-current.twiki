This is an internal page for Doug Strain to keep track of what he is doing:

---++ Ongoing tasks (from OSG Storage):

High-level view:
|Project|Task|Percentage FTE|Priority|Comments|
|Support|osg-storage,GOC tickets|20%|High|Users should be high priority, mailing lists ~2-3 issues/week, Alain said could spend up to 50% of allocated .5 FTE|
|Packaging|Many packages|40%|Medium-High|Between all the packages below, keeps me busy|
|Testing|Fermicloud smoke test + test stand|15%|Medium|Test stand failing, drop it?|
|Development|Bestman,probes,discovery tools|5%|Low|Spikes occasionally, Bestman scares me|
|Documentation||20%-&gt;5%|Low|Big effort previously, but should ramp down|

---++ Upcoming Tasks:

   * Packaging
      * pigeon tools (medium -&gt; low priority)
      * xrootd 3.1.1 release
      * !BeStMan dependency reduction: ongoing
      * SL6 packages: discovery tools, BeStMan, other SE packages
    * Open JIRA tickets: about 8-10
    * Open GOC tickets: zero currently
 
---++ Testing framework

The following serves as internal notes to remind me of the existing test infrastructure and aid in determining the form of future testing effort.
It is still in very rough format.

Current test frameworks:
   * Validation testing by Tanya (using static test stand)
   * Stress testing by Haifeng Pi
   * Java based web framework done by Neha
   * RSV / pigeon probes by Doug

Current testing matrix (from validation tests):
   * bestman2_gateway_disk
   * bestman2_gateway_hadoop
   * bestman2_gateway_xrootd
   * bestman_fullmode (drop?) [space reservation]
   * xrootd with 2 clusters and &quot;global&quot; redirector with FRM
   * dCache (only used to test third-party transfer)

Each one should be tested:
   * With static tokens (used by Atlas) &amp; Without static tokens   
   * With clients lcg, fermi, and lbnl  (used to check with 
   * third party transfers between each pair
   * upgrade procedure

Currently using:
   * *Hadoop*: namenode gw018k0, secondary name-node+!GridFTP+!BeStMan gw018k1, data nodes: gw015k2, gw015k3, gw016k2, gw016k3, gw017k2, gw017k3, gw018k2, gw018k3
   * Xrootd: Bestman gateway gw015k1, cluster: gw016k0 rdr, gw016k1, gw017k0, gw017k1 (gw014k1 global redirector)
   * Bestman standalone without tokens:
   * Bestman standalone with tokens:
   * RSV / monitoring: gw014k0
   * dCache: (not supported) gwdca06 dCache admin node, gwdca05 PNFS node, gwdca04 SRM, gwdca03 Dcap, GridFTP doors, gwdca02,gwdca01 pool node



   * Bestman on disk: fg0x5 (going away), ?? fg7x5 (going away)
   * Xrootd: cluster on fermicloud (going away)
   * !BeStMan Stress test: some bare-metal in ITB ???fgitb315.fnal.gov:10443 (going away)
