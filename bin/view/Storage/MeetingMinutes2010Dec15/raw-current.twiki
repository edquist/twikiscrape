---++ Status report
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Alex:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
* Support
  - support for STAR data delivery from PDSF to BNL via bestman full mode
  - support for &quot;srm-copy -f&quot; for LIGO case
    * support implementation for more synchronized srm requests and file transfers between sources and targets.
    * enhancements on concurrency management, connection timeout handing, and retry handling for multiple files in a request
  - write-up use cases from STAR data delivery
  - Support for EMI SRM security change agreement
  - Follow-up for bestman licence with LBNL tech dept
 &lt;/pre&gt;

Doug:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- Documentation: created documentation for storage probes.  Began documentation for RSV pigeon
- RSV: Ironing out issues with pigeon and working with
- GlueX: Underlying issue was firewall-related.  Talking with Richard Jones about further steps.
- Storage Investigation: will begin looking at storage probes for space calculations.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Jeff:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
Hadoop RPMs:
- now able to rsync updates from caltech repo to vdt repo
- found differences between caltech and vdt repositories, discovered
xrootd-1.3.2-7 rpms were missing from vdt so I copied them over. Michael
said there are newer versions that have since been built but haven&#39;t
made it to the caltech repo.

Documentation:
- sent Tanya twiki documentation proposal for updating hadoop docs

Todo:
- still learning the process to build rpms on Michael and Brian&#39;s koji
system and how to push builds from koji into both caltech and vdt repos
- finish installing test hadoop setup
&lt;/pre&gt;

Neha:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
- sevalidation testsuite 
    tested/fixed the functionality of using existing configuration
    worked on space token logic for dcache based se&#39;s. 
    checked everything in cvs.
o status meeting with tanya
- pinged osg-int about testing of vdt-dcache-3.0.4
- pinged Igor for his dCache SRM testing. set him up on gridworks since we now no longer use dcache.kpwd.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Tanya:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
      meeting with LIGO
      meeting with Alain
      meetings with Neha, Doug
      doc. team telecon

      made remote presentation at  OSG School in Brazil, 
              organized some other remote presentations 
      analyzed LIGO results for files transfer, wrote the summary
      xrootd:
         started working on new  xrootd configuration used by  Tier-3
         tested simple inventory setting 
         failed to make frm configuration to work - will wait for new rpm release
     tested pigeon/RSV installation, discussed the results with Scot and Doug
     provided feedback to Alain for &quot;Software input for 2010 DOE Annual Report&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
LIGO Status and !BeStMan srm-copy
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We have finished to working on transfers testing with LIGO:
   1. Robert adjusted condor throttling ( otherwise all the 50 jobs started simultaneously making submission node unresponsive). Robert also  increased the RAM allocated for submission node (VM) in order to prevent any memory swapping when four srm-copy commands were running.
   1. Britta ran 16 tests transferring 5,000 file (16MB) from LIGO gridftp server to Nebraska and to OUHEP_OSG. 
   1. Both sites have !BeStMan2 installed. Nebraska is running !BeStMan2/HDFS and OUHEP has !BeStMan2/local disk+ nfs.
   1. OUHEP is a small Tier-3 site with one gridftp server, Nebraska is CMS - Tier-2 site with 10 gridftp servers
   1. LIGO -&gt; OUHEP.  6 out 8 transfers have  finished successfully , 2 tests were terminated by the srm-copy client because of the bug (see #8). Four tests have experienced some gridftp errors that apparently indicate the high load on the grdiftp server on OUHEP. Two of them were able to recover after automatic retries performed by srm-copy client and the other two were terminated by srm-copy (see #8). It took ~  9 hours 30 min to transfer 5,000 files (80GB) with 4 jobs each executing one srm-copy command with one gridftp transfer. It took ~ 2hours 20 min  to transfer 5,000 files (80GB) with 4 jobs each executing one srm-copy command with five gridftp transfer.
   1. LIGO -&gt; Nebraska. All the transfers finished successfully without any grdiftp errors.It took less then 9 hours 30 min to transfer 5,000 files (80GB) with 4 jobs each executing one srm-copy command with one gridftp transfer. It took ~ 2 hours   to transfer 5,000 files (80GB) with 4 jobs each executing one srm-copy command with five gridftp transfer.
   1. Most of the tests have been repeated twice and results were pretty consistent 
   1. srm-copy bug: srm-copy stops the transfer as soon as the elapsed time since s start time exceeds the time specified in the --timeout option. So with timeout set to 3600 sec, srm-copy exists after in an hour  regardless of success or failure of transfers. The bug is  fixed by developers but not released yet.
   1. !BeStMan developers are working on improving &quot;srm-copy -f file -concurrency N&quot;  efficiency. The command will be ready for testing soon (hopefully this week).
   1. We are looking on various java options that can be used to decrease memory usage by srm-copy command. The memory is allocated on start up and doesn&#39;t increase during the srm-copy execution.
   1. With network bandwidth limit set by LIGO admin it looks like 4 srm-copy commands with concurrency set to 5  is  suitable for LIGO tests. It should take about 26 hours to transfer the weekly data set (1 TB). We should retry all the tests as soon as more efficient srm-copy is available


Vijaya (!BeStMan client developer) is working on srm-copy -f improvement, version for !BeStMan2 will be ready this week. We will ask LIGO to redo all the tests after we finish certifying this version,

---++ Second Agenda Item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
HDFS rpms

---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Jeff was able to make rsync work between Caltech and Wisconsin. He is working now on building rpms and documenting the process. He has submitted a proposal on rearranging and improving hadoop documentation. Hopefully we will be able to discuss it during doc telecon.

---++ Third agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
pigeon and RSV probes
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
We have discussed several issues we have encountered during pigeon/RSV tests:
   1. order of the probes displayed in alphabetical order. That doesn&#39;t make sense for pigeon probes. Alain has proposed to make a pigeon HTML consumer and rearrange display the way we want it. Doug will work on it with Scot help.
   1. allow to start pigeon without pinging the srm node first. Scot will  provide -no-ping option for RSV
   1. put pigeon under vdt control. Doug and Scot will work on it. 

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Test suites framework
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
Neha has done a lot of progress working on the framework, she will need to include tests for all srm-clients (not only fermi). Tanya will start working on incorporating existing tests into the framework,

---++ Fourth agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
dcahe status 
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;
   1. dCache developers are looking into a problem with pnfsDump at Wisconsin. 
   1. Igor has started stressed tests on gridwork (dcache 1.9.5-23). We are not expecting any significant changes in the results.
   1. Neha will start working on installing and testing 1.9.10 version in January.
