---+++++ Installation - Ted
A preview version of the VDT packaging of dCache 1.8 has been created for sites to experiment with. The scripts only support a fresh install. Further work will be needed to support upgrades from 1.7 to 1.8. Tanya said that some parts of Trash.StoragePoolManager.conf have been deprecated. Ted will make the preview package available on the VDT web site. A new version of dCache, 1.7.0-47 has been release. Neha will add a feature to install_pnfs.sh to search for rpcinfo if it is not found in the path. That change and the new dCache patch will be put in the next VDT packaging of dCache production version. Neha will test that package for upgrades on the ITB fapl test stand. Discussion of supporting lcg-utils. See Testing.

---+++++ Extensions - Ted
Discussed opportunistic storage via space reservations in dCache by associated a rootpath in the namespace with a set of pools, and having link for them authorization for the VOs.  Users will be able to make space reservations within those pools. The reservations will expire and the files cleaned up using Greg Sharp&#39;s space reservation cleaner tool, thus recycling the space. Ted will write instructions, and consider methods of preventing abuse of the storage, such as only making reservations possible using an intermediate tool which limits reservation size. Discussed how opportunistic storage would work with Bestman. Alex described how it could be done in User-controlled space using unix file permissions and quotas.

---+++++ Testing - Tanya
Neha will modify load test scripts to use lcg-utils to check performance on GridWorks test stand. Ted will supply the rpms and instructions for installation. Tanya will begin working on scripts to test space reservation.
