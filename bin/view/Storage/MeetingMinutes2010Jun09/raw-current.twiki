---++ First agenda item
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION --&gt;
Pigeon tools
---+++ Discussion
&lt;!-- describe the discussion that took place --&gt;

Doug is done with the first phase of the prototype (https://gw014k0.fnal.gov:8443/gip). The following improvements/fixes have been discussed during the meeting:
   1. it looks like in some cases, test is not repeated after failure (globus_url_copy_Firefly - last time ran 	2010-06-08 10:33:01)
   1. srmmkdir test should reports warning if test directory is already exists 
   1. the specified VO should be a parameter to generator and not hardcoded
   1. classic SE should be distinguished from srm-SE
   1. it will be nice if the web page allows to add link to GOC ticket number based on the discovered problem
   1. source code should be under source control (asked Alain for vdt svn module, put in Fermilab cvs right now)
   1. continue work on documentation (http://home.fnal.gov/~dstrain/testing.html)
