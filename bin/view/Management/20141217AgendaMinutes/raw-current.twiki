Key Initiatives
   1. Info Services - to discover new production end-points. New software released. Job submission does not depend critically on this service. Draft SLA available; targeting end-Jan for production deployment. Working with WLCG to eventually retire the service.
   2. HTCondor-CE deployment: all CMS T1/2 install it now. Behind with Atlas. SAMv3 integrated with HTCondor-CE.
   3. Centralized Network repository -  progressing well but slowly. Optimistic about addressing scalability limitations in test by using production-quality hardware.


Top Issues / Concerns
   1. OASIS external repositories: need to clarify interfaces between VOs and OSG - working with Fermilab VO. Organizing security drill for the support of egi.eu key.


Key Accomplishments
   1. The “European HTCondor Site Admins” meeting at CERN was well attended - helps spread HTC philosophy
   2. Scalability tests (see also REQUEST-66) - did not meet goal on running jobs for a single HTCondor-CE (done 12k vs. goal of 20k). Achieved several other scalability goals. Targeting new tests in 6 months.
   3. Discussed OSG AuthZ model at CERN meeting on EGI AuthZ future. OSG is pioneer in VO / Grid trust delegation. This simplifies operations significantly.
