Ben -- too little lab time. Need to restrict talk time to 30 minutes. Need to tune the slides up to match the course. Need to extend the lab time. 4-7 helpers for each lab for 68 students. Make infrastructure available and make assignments workable after the school is over or standalone. Network, VM, application - could be trimmed. Recommendation to keep to 2 days. Goal to be 80% application, 20% CS.
