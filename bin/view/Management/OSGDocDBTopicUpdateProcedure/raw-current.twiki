---+!! OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org][DocDB]] Topic Update Procedure
%TOC%

---++ Scope
The procedure for updating the OSG Document Database Topic List and subsequent documents as they are added. 

---++ Topic List Explanation

   * The full topic list and explanation is available [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/topics_cert.html][here]] and made up of 7 main categories.  A brief explanation below can be used in conjunction with the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/topics_cert.htm][Topic List Guidelines]] in order to determine the proper location for a specific document: 
   1. *Activities* These papers and presentations address logistical and actual implementation issues addressed in OSG.  This area should not include presentations for informational or educational purposes, unless they also reference specific activity implementation in OSG.  
   1. *Communications*  Papers and presentations included in communications include a much broader category, and are a good place many presentations that are given &quot;about&quot; OSG.  Anything for educational or teaching and outreach purposes also belongs in communications.  For example a educational presentation about how OSG uses grid computing, that does not address specific operational issues, is for communications and belongs in this category. 
   1. *Governance* Papers and presentations, including policies, that address general managerial issues belong in this category.  
   1. *Historical* This category was created to house papers and presentations that are no longer relevant to current OSG operations.  Confirm with the executive officer before moving materials to this category.  
   1. *Science* Category for research papers and presentations regarding science work done through OSG.
   1. *Security* Created specifically to document the protection of OSG assests and generally only administered by the OSG security team. 
   1. *Software*  Documentation of any software or middleware.
