---+!! *Any Data Any Time Any Where - AAA*



---++ Introduction


The project PI is Ken Bloom (University of Nebraska)  



---++ Expectations
The project will build software tools to provide seamless access to a national-scale data access infrastructure that will complement the currently deployed data management system in CMS. The
focus will be on the activities of the end user, and has the following goals:

   * Reliability: The end-user should never see an I/O error or failure propagated up to their application unless no USCMS site can serve the file. Failures should be caught as early as possible and I/O retried or rerouted to a different site (possibly degrading the service slightly).
   * Transparency: All actions of the underlying system should be automatic for the user: catalog lookups, redirections, reconnections. There should not be a different workflow for accessing the data “close by” versus halfway around the world.
   * Usability: All CMS application frameworks (CMS framework software (CMSSW), FWLite, bare ROOT) must natively integrate with any proposed solution. The proposed solution must not degrade the event processing rate significantly.
   * Efficiency: As discussed in Section 2.1, the present CMS computing model with its static placement of data leads to significant inefficiencies of data placement. With this proposal we strive for more dynamic data access and placement, including having the ability to access data in our Tier-2 caches from Tier-3, cloud and other resources the CMS project does not explicitly own.

The OSG provides the API and processes that form the foundation
of the CMS computing systems in the US. As such, OSG the primary contact 
with WLCG. As the deliverables of this proposal become production-quality services, they will be
contributed to OSG to become part of the OSG API. The project depends on the OSG
software distribution channels and processes to provide the software developed by this project to
CMS Tier-2 and Tier-3 centers in the US and South America.

AAA works with OSG on the necessary documentation and providing deployment
support and operational knowledge. Within the context of OSG software lifecycle processes,
this project will function as software provider for any functionality we develop and integrate. These
commitments go beyond CMS in particular and the LHC community in general to the extent that
other sciences decide to adopt these technologies.
