---++ Software - Tim Cartwright

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 4 September 2013:

   * Contributed to four releases: [[Documentation.Release3.Release3123][3.1.23]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3124][3.1.24]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3125][3.1.25]]
      * Java 7 packages to 3.1 production
      * Gratia probes filter excessive CPU info
      * !jGlobus 2.0.6
      * !glideinWMS 2.7.2
      * Many fixes to osg-configure
      * Initial release of osg-control
      * Improved Globus log file rotation
      * HTCondor 8.0.2 and HTCondor-CE (HTCondor batch system only)
      * VO package updates

   * Deployed yum/mash changes for OSG Next &amp;mdash; support for future release series (e.g., 3.2, 3.3, 4.0, &amp;hellip;)

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * WBS 1.x: Ongoing

   * [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][WBS 2.1: Transition from Oracle Java 6 to !OpenJDK 7]] &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;

   * WBS 2.2: Add support for SLURM resource management system &amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;complete!&lt;/span&gt;

   * [[SoftwareTeam.SP021_NewVersions][WBS 2.3: Prepare for OSG 3.2 and beyond (aka “OSG Next”)]]
      * Deployments to date have gone *very* smoothly; kudos to Carl, !BrianB, and Mat
      * Final deployment is scheduled for next Tuesday, 22 October
      * Aiming for a 3.2.0 release on 12 November

   * WBS 2.4: Merge in latest Globus Toolkit changes, including upstreamed patches
   * WBS 4.1: Move Globus patches upstream
      * Submitted many of our patches to Globus
      * Just waiting for them to be integrated and released; Globus Toolkit 5.2.6, maybe

   * WBS 3.1: Unify HTCondor RPMs: Ready to transition to HTCondor/Release team

   * WBS 3.2: Take over Debian support: transitioned to HTCondor/Release team

   * WBS 3.3: Release HTCondor-CE
      * Support for HTCondor batch system complete
      * Still working on PBS support
      * Others to come eventually

   * WBS 5.1: Simplify test development by improving test framework
      * Added first GUMS test, !MySQL preserve/restore code, fixed many small to medium issues
      * Added dynamically generated CA, CRL, and host certificates (can run in more environments)
      * Will rewrite sequencing engine, express tests as DAG, and randomize topological sort (more diversity)

   * WBS 5.2: Run tests as normal jobs locally and perhaps in OSG
      * Have made a great deal of progress here
      * Now running 120 tests daily: 4 platforms, 5 repository selections, 6 top-level packages
      * Plan is to replace current tests with VM universe-based ones in next 2 months or so
      * Still working through many technical challenges

   * WBS 6.1: 2013 OSG User School
      * Wrapping up finances and final assignments from 2013 School
      * Planning follow-ups, in terms of a survey or two, plus mentoring duties
      * Starting to think about using (the dreaded?) social media to help promote and communicate

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Staffing*
      * Still working on hiring and staff duties at some institutions

   * *Tracking Upstream Changes*
      * Example: Still had condor-7.8.6 long after 7.8.8 had been released
      * We package so many upstream components, that it is very difficult to track changes to all of them
      * Nominally assigned to the Release team now, but it is a big task
      * Need to work with !BrianB and !TimT to come up with a real plan here

         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3123][3.1.23]]: Java 7, osg-control, VO package v47; Upcoming: HTCondor 8.0.2, HTCondor-CE
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3124][3.1.24]]: osg-configure, frontier-squid part of osg-oasis, Java7: xrootd-hdfs, gridftp-hdfs 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3124][3.1.25]]: gratia-probes, GUMS, Globus, jGlobus 2.0.6, glideinWMS 2.7.2, VO package v48 

   * SHA-2 signed certificates
      * Tested in production environment with early adopters
      * No issues reported

   * Java 7
      * Tested in production environment with early adopters
      * One early adopter reported problems with IBM Java 7 JDK
      * Software skew delayed part of Java 7 deployment

   * Needed 3.1.24 urgent release
      * Defects in osg-configure
      * Complete Java 7 work

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * ITB instance in Madison
      * Be better able to test the system as a whole
      * Much closer to the user experience

   * Collect Standard Test Cases
      * Repeatability of Testing
      * Able to hand components to new testers

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Urgent Releases*
      * Takes time away from long term goals

   * *Difficult to Get Early Adopters*
      * Multiple Solicitations needed
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs
      * Perhaps, some (not all) people that scream for something are not willing to test?
