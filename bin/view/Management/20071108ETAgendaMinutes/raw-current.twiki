---+++ Attendees: RobG, Maxim, Alina, Chander, Ruth, Doug, Alain, John, Miron, Frank

---+++   All Hands meeting planning
Frank to give John a brain dump on the UCSD meeting. One liner: Make sure Ruth and Miron give clear directions on the goals; Make sure careful about mission creep.

Goals: 
   * Tier-2/Tier-3 was a success. Is there a focus for  this time? Site Administrators and Users face to face and ability to interact? cf LIGO hands-on workshop with application developers and infrastructure developers? All-hands Work rather than all hands Talk. Talk about Principles rather than &quot;PR&quot;
   * Issue of parallel vs plenary. One parallel session was very lightly attended because of the parallel sessions. 
   * Must control length of time people talk; need to accommodate those that talk longer. 
   * We don&#39;t follow up on issues identified or found at each meeting.
   * Bio group of people? 
   * Thinking along these lines. 
   * another round needed in next couple of weeks - offline meeting.

---+++    Trash/Engagement Report
Campus: 
   * UCLA - work through existing OSG Tier-3 systems already running jobs. Work with Tier-3 and other Campus infrastructure at UCLA to merge or form a campus grid.  Bill Labate is contact.
   * Duke - Examining Condor on HPC cluster  and looking to an OSG gateway. Full campus identity management. Hopefully demonstration bi-directional jobs as first goal.
   * Invited talk at City University of New York next week. Looking for some practical things. bridge to OSG. 
   * Clemson - Mats working with Clemson to get some of the Engage jobs running at Clemson. Using as pathfinder to get access from OSG to Clemson resources. Mats away for a couple of weeks. Figure out flocking between Wisconsin (Ken) and Clemson  to lift jobs to Wisconsin. Putting the list of issues of &quot;OSG infrastructure&quot; should be in parallel with demonstrated usage, after the basic mechanisms are in place and we understand how they work. Not a significant group that is part of our stakeholders. Should address &quot;the long list&quot; after have some understanding moving jobs between the sites. In fact may be ready to put some of the capabilities into VDT. 
   * Crimson - new hire locally. every now and then there is interest. no great activity. Miron pings every now and then. 
   * GLOW - accepting OSG jobs; lifting up CMS jobs. checkpointing issues with other users except for football. 
   * WRF are ready to provide a research highlight soon. 


Users: 
   * PNNL - small step identified within budget available there. get parallel BLAST running outside of PNNL at Wisconsin - impact on local I/O system is minor, does not need a shared file system.
   * MPI needs advertising from the OSG of capabilities (not first priority); building the applications; and the same defaults at each the landing point and once this is in place such applications should become much easier? Decided to create for all the different sites a template for running the jobs there including the make file etc. Greg owns the action item. Maxim: will start with NERSC (waiting for comments from David Skinner and Doug) and Purdue (Preston); Need to change code in Panda for CHARMM to run on Purdue. 
   * Virginia Tech: SC data challenge. Originally MPI. Lateness resulted in no big success before SC. but ready to continue after SC using Engage VO.
   * NIST: Now have access to the Engage VO. Ready to start running test jobs on evaluation of text and images. Goal to provide a generally available service for data mining algorithms on top of OSG services. data dissemination as well as execution service? OSG will provide mirrors at BNL and RENCI (resources contributing to OSG); Protected access? Can we offer them certificate services and will other OSG services be beneficial at all? Longer term plan to look at have 80-100 participants bring the algorithms into OSG and run on the resources accessible through the OSG. &quot;What does it mean to turn this group into an OSG VO&quot; is a relevant question to have in the back of our minds; with VO running certain services for them. Want to add to the infrastructure ability to run on specific sites rather than general matchmaking. Matchmaking is advisory not a security enforcer - how to tell one is on the correct site? Signed-classads coming.
   * RENCI text mining of journal articles ~100,000s: some large test runs on OSG already. retooling the application.
   * RENCI genetics application. Few months work remaining.

---+++    Resources Managers
   * Written Finance Board report - Kent is tied up with an NSF review. 
   * Quarterly PI reports status: 6 posted. need 10 more. 
   * OSG agreements: Will enumerate all the agreements needed and have tracking mechanism. NYSGrid at Council; CDIGS draft coming. 
   * SOW Status: 5 fully approved. 8 signed off within OSG management/PI and are with the SROs. 1 more up for OSG review. Waiting closure on UCSD, BNL, LBNL.

---+++ Executive Director Report
   * Expectations of Worker Node Environment
Goal is to make sure we support our stakeholders and at the same time meet our principles: a) what is the bar for entry of a new capability on the worker nodes. want this as small as possible. b) if we agree it needs to be there, what are the security issues for adding the s/w to the worker nodes. ie need a process for adding capabilities to the WN s/w. Mats mentions that propagating the MPI environment to the WN is essential for running MPI applications on the OSG. Ruth to call a meeting of the application representatives: specific tools - Alain will send out the list. 

   * Upcoming meetings
   * Accounting Requirements
