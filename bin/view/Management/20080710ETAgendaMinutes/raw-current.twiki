Status:

Ruth expecting request/ok from D0 management (Qhizong talking to spokespeople) for: 3 week task force to increase D0 efficiency on OSG; led by Joel Snow; D0 effort: Robert Illingworth; RESS support: Parag; OSG Storage: Andrew. At completion will define things as &quot;as good as able to achieve&quot; and OSG proposes to not support D0 running at sites with &lt;10% efficiency. Would be good to have an SLD for D0 for FY09 for sustained throughput expectations. 

Homework:

   * Miron to check with Michael Ernst about delay in bestman/xrootd teststand testing due to D0 task force.
   * Ruth/Chander to fill in &quot;OSG Meeting for Followup&quot; and &quot;Fully qualified name of Action Item owner&quot; columns in Action Item spreadsheet
   * Miron/Chander to look at drill downs/easier to parse spreadsheet for action item register.
