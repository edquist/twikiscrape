Key Initiatives
   1. CILogon Basic CA Adoption - acceptance is proceeding slowly: no more sites than the original testing 5; users only from the HCC VO. Progress on Fermilab acceptance for docdb. Plan to expand with VOs and sites in parallel: currently, effort limited because Kevin Hill is busy at 60% on PKI transition.
   2. Traceability Requirements for users w/o certitficates - the goal is for users to use glideinWMS w/o certificates. Sites would delegate taceability to VOs. Some sites (e.g. BNL) are confortable w/ this. Progress on the approval process for Fermilab.
   3. Operational Security - focusing on SHA-2 - work proceeding on time: more tests to start in Apr; finish risk assessment of md5 and sha-1 proxy. Preparing for internal gWMS drill.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Potential lack of effort for CVMFS audit at GOC - As part of the CVMFS deployment at the GOC in April, OSG Security will provide a deployment audit. Kevin Hill is counted on for this work, but he is currently assigned at 60% to the PKI transition project at Fermilab. Need to ascertain the project due date to validate his availability. The potential delay may impact customers such as NOvA.
   2. ID management roadmap &amp; Survey of &quot;How OSG Resource Providers consume Identity Information&quot; - Need more input from ET on the roadmap and on the survey to ascertain that the information collected meets our needs.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Pakiti site monitoring - Software is released. Need to advertise now: planning for a tutorial at the AHM. Will engage the 10 sites that use the central OSG service for a local deployment.
