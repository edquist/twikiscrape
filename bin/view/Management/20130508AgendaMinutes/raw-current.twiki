---+++ Minutes
Key Initiatives (Campus Grid)
   1. Moving CIC activities to the forefront. Gearing up for the next workshop: discussing a new format more centered on interactions; scheduled monthly webinars for the next 2 months, focusing on hands-on sessions biweekly; archiving all contributed material.
   2. Integrating Bosco with community-specific computational environment. Focusing on making OSG resources available through Bosco from an R session. Next release of Bosco (v1.2) expected in May, focusing on reliability and user friendliness; planning for v1.3 in Aug.

Top Issues / Concerns (Campus Grid)
   1. Understand appropriate deployment model for BOSCO to grant users immediate access to OSG resources. Working with Vanderbilt to make resources available to OSG via campus technologies; need to integrate Bosco with application-specific user interfaces to lower barrier for adoption.
   2. Understand how to acknowledge (account, report, publish, etc.) use of OSG resources by Campus users.

Key Accomplishments (Campus Grid)
   1. The CIC workshop at Indiana has broaden the number of people interested in Campus technologies.
