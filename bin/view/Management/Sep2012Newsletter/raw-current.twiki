_A year’s research in a matter of hours: OSG accelerates Tyler Churchill’s cochlear implant modeling._

With the help of the OSG, University of Wisconsin at Madison Waisman Center researcher Tyler Churchill is taking advantage of the accelerated analysis timeline provided by the OSG’s distributed computing resource to research ways to improve hearing with cochlear implants (CI). So far over 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations have been produced. Churchill’s modeling focuses on one nerve fiber at a time. Translated, one second of auditory stimulus would normally take a week to process on a single node ….  [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Management/ResearchHighlight31][Read More]]

----+++ *OSG Staff Changes*
---++++_Wishing Alain Roy and Scot Kronenfeld all the very best_

 &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/alain_roy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alain_roy.jpg&quot; width=&#39;100&#39; height=&#39;120&#39; align=&quot;left ; margin: 10px 10px 15px 0;&quot; /&gt;

It is with sadness that we are reporting the departure of Alain Roy and Scot Kronenfeld from the OSG Software Team. Many of you have benefited from Alain’s leadership of and many contributions to the Virtual Data Toolkit, the Software Area and the Software Toolkit Group over the past several years. We can all attest to the excellence of his technical  skills, his infinite patience and courtesy, and his commitment and engagement across the vision and practicalities of the OSG’s support for science and research. 
    
We wish Alain all the very best as he moves to a software development position in Washington State to be near the rest of his extended family. We are preparing one of the “OSG plaques” and will be sending him this at his new address in the next couple of weeks.

     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/Scot_Kronefeld.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scot_Kronefeld.jpg&quot; width=&#39;100&#39; height=&#39;120&#39; align=&quot;left ; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0;&quot; /&gt;    

We also note the departure of another key, important member of the OSG software team at Wisconsin – Scot Kronenfeld. As he moves onto new responsibilities at the university, we wish him all the best and thank him for sterling and committed service to the OSG program of work. 

We wish  bonne chance to them both.

---++++_Welcome Tim Cartwright as the interim Software Area Lead_

     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/Tim_Cartwright.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tim_Cartwright.jpg&quot; width=&#39;100 height=&#39;120&#39; align=&quot;left ; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0;&quot; /&gt;   

Please welcome Tim Cartwright in his new role as the interim Software Area Lead, replacing Alain Roy for the next few months. Tim has extensive experience as part of the OSG Software Area, and has already started in his new role with Alain’s departure. 

---++++_Welcoming Von Welch into the OSG staff fold_      

     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/VonWelch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VonWelch.jpg&quot; width=&#39;110&#39; height=&#39;125&#39; align=&quot;left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0;&quot; /&gt; 

You have seen many recent reports from Von in his role as lead  of the PKI Transition Project to move us to OSG supplied PKI services.  We are very pleased that he will continue to contribute to the OSG project – as part of the Indiana University team – once the PKI transition is complete, focusing on the areas of identity management and security.

---+++ *OSG Annual Report to the National Science Foundation*

OSG submitted our annual progress report to the National Science Foundation (NSF) on September 4, 2012.  This report is technically associated with the “old” Open Science Grid project, but it is equally applicable to the “next 5 years” OSG project, which officially started on June 1, 2012.  

In this report, we highlight the accomplishments of the OSG in addressing the needs of our stakeholders and the work program, which is now structured in alignment with the recently awarded “next 5-years” OSG project. We report on the project accomplishments, the contributions from our many partners in the OSG “eco-system”, and on how we are addressing the futures challenges.

The actual work involved with writing this report is a distributed process (much like OSG!) with the functional area coordinators contributing chapters and the Council Chair and Project Manager providing final editing.  

The OSG Annual Report is available as a public documents in the OSG DocDB, please see:  http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1117

---+++ *Report from the Council Chair*

     &lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/pordes_100.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pordes_100.jpg&quot; width=&#39;80&#39; height=&#39;110&#39; algin=&quot;left ; margin: 10px 25px 10px 0;&quot; /&gt;    


I would like to draw your attention to 3 new OSG Council sub-committees that I am facilitating to help move the OSG Consortium forward over the next years to success. 
These cover:

a) Consortium and Council member representation, organization, and responsibilities. 

b) OSG and industry – goals, scope, ideas. 

c) Sustaining the OSG past the next few years.  

Several members of the Council are stepping up to contribute to these committees. My goal is to be able to report back to the Council by the end of this calendar year on these activities.

We welcome your input and contributions to these three sub-committees.

Also, you will note the first in a set of new research highlights above. We are actively looking for research and outcomes to write up in this series – please don’t hesitate to contact me, Sarah or Greg with your accomplishments.
