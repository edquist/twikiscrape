---+++ Vulnerabilities/Incidents

    A Linux kernel vulnerability known as DirtyCOW, which allows privilege escalation was reported by the end of October, 2016. OSG received the report from EGI: https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2016-5195 It consists of a race condition found in the way the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. By exploiting this vulnerability, an unprivileged local user could gain access to read-only memory mappings and increase her privileges on the system. OSG sent multiple announcements to the community with an initial assessment of the vulnerability and later with updated links for security patches. 

---+++ Risk Assessment 2016 

    Zalak and Jeny have been performing the OSG Risk Assessment for 2016 and updating the OSG Security Plan.  Surveys were conducted to all OSG Core service owners to evaluate the security controls in the OSG Security Plan.  It is nearing completion, as Zalak and Jeny include some final information regarding software and CA cert distribution, and complete formatting tasks.

---+++ Miscellaneous

   * Twiki for security team was separated from the Security working area (private reports, procedures).  Obsolete information is being removed.

   * OSG Security team had a meeting with Steve Tuecke about Globus Auth. It is unclear whether or not OSG will end up using Globus Auth.

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Risk assessment and Security Plan update - Ready for internal review in Jan.
   2. Meeting with Glous Auth with Steve Tucke. Evaluating technology in the OSG context.
   3. Security support of the transition from gLExec to Singularity: focusing on testing and user feedback.
   4. Progress on information sharing on vulnerability. Fermilab is becoming a member of  the Certify group under the InCommon federation. Mine and Susan will discuss whether OSG should become a member too. Other groups may be relevant too.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Follow up on progress related to recent issues on security certificate issuance

Key Accomplishments
   1. Incident response of the DirtyCOW linux vulnerability. Fully remediated. Sites responded appropriately and promptly. A notification from sites when remediation occurs would be an improvement in the future.
