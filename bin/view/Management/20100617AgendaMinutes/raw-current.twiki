---++ Agenda
 
   * 2.1 Scalability, Reliability and Usability  – Igor Sfiligoi
      * Collaboration with Globus team on GRAM5, helping them iron out the last of the bugs they had on an OSG setup.
         Will run a last round of tests before the end of year.
      * Testing out the latest CREAM version. Gathering installation documentation and forwarding it to VDT.
         Contributed CREAM-related code to glideinWMS.
         Condor 7.5.3 will introduce a new way to talk to CREAM, so I will test this.
      * Started testing ARC.
         Have an installed instance at UCSD, but I am still struggling with proper configuration.
      * Continued collaboration with Condor on the scalability front.
         Latest achievement is using 30k glideins using a single schedd.
      * Deployed a 13-node BestMan+Hadoop-based storage test pool and used it for storage scalability tests.
      * Set up a scalability test infrastructure at UCSD, based on the glideTester
         Have been using it to test various storage aspects.
         The glideTester got several improvements as we gained more operational experience.
         Presented the glideTester at the IWHGA2010 workshop.
      * Extensive tests to BestMan+Hadoop.
         Performed tests using several configuration settings.
         The best test run was with 2k clients generating operations at 50Hz-100Hz.
      * Tested dCache on a test instance at FNAL (operated by Tanya and Neha).
         Results can be seen on [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/DCTest][this Twiki page]].
      * Study of BestMan+Hadoop+FDT over 10+Gbps WAN links.
         Searching for bottlenecks.

   * 3.2 Communications &amp; Education – Dave Ritchie – 
            Report -- [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Management/20100617AgendaMinutes/Communications_Area_Coordinator_Report.pdf][Area Coordinator&#39;s Report]].
