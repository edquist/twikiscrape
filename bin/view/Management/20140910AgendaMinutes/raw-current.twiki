   1 Identity Management
      1 CILogon Basic CA IGTF accredited and distributed in default OSG distribution. This was reported on our previous meeting. The good news is that Fermilab decided to accept this CA for access to its resources. This is an important fall back mechanism for OSG users who needs to have CIlogon Basic CA certs and access Fermilab resources. We can even safely send some of our OSG users to CIlogon Basic CA if they have to have certificates and they can access all OSG resources.
      1 The other news with CILogon Basic CA is that they asked OSG about canceling their partnership with ProtectNetwork. ProtectNetwork is the catch-call IdP for users whose home organization does not provide an IdP. Fermilab is one of the big users.  We, OSG and Fermilab agreed that Cilogon Basic CA can stop paying for this service if they wish too. Fermilab will provide its own IdP. ProtectNetwork service will become unavailable to us in December. 
      1 HCC VO is going through its assessment to submit certificate-free jobs to OSG. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/HCCJobTraceability
      1 SHA-2 conversion is finally completing. We are completely ready. This final step will consists of: changing the CA&#39;s certificates to sha-2. please note that so far we changed our users certificates to sha-2 but the CAs themselves still have certs with sha-1 hashing algorithm. his will change in the final step. We completed our work for this step and waiting for Digicert to make the change. 
      1 There has been a lot of requests from our users to use robot certs. Contacted Digicert, they can provide this but this is not included in their profile officially yet. We are working with them to understand what it takes to get robot certs. 
      1 Submitted a full paper on our work on traceability project to ISGC. it describes our work in regards to submitting certificate-free jobs to OSG. 
      1 CILogon HSM project. The prototype is fully functional and completed. We wrote the MOU and sent it to XSEDE and OSG. we are waiting for the response. If this project is accepted, this project will gain higher priority and we will start working on getting ready for the end of our contract with Digicert in 2 years.  
   1 Operational Security
      1 Increasing frequency of bitcoin mining operations in non-OSG scientific research facilities worried us and made us examine our AUP. Our goal is to ensure all VOs are aware that running such applications on OSG is not acceptable and they make their users aware of this. We reached out to all the VOs about our goal and asked them whether they have an AUP in place. Our results are listed at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/VOAUPSurvey. The bad news is we heard back from 9 VOs only. The good news is some of them are already doing a good job of informing their users. For the VOs that only use glideinwms, we asked them to display the AUP to their users when users log into the submit node. OSG VO and the OSGConnect already implemented this.    
      1 Risk assessments for glideinwms system and bitcoin attacks
      1 Working on a new security drill to conduct with the new HTCondor ce. 
      1 Problems with importing the certificates into MacOS keychain. The problem turned out to be a library version issue. the updated library changed the format of the p12 file and that caused the issue. Soichi already fixed the problem. the nice thing about this issue was that we followed our newly created change management process. 
      1 Security controls and updated risk assessment. 
   1 Concerns Issues
      1 Not a big concern but we are waiting for a while to hear on CIlogon HSM project. 
      1 We want to complete the sha-2 transition completely. this is not a bog concern but I am curious why we could not get a response from Digicert. Usually they are very prompt.
