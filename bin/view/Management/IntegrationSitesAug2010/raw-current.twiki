   * Reinstalled ITB OSG sites (LBNL_DSD_ITB and UC_ITB) due to changes in the cache scheme
   * Participated in 4 rounds of ITB testing leading to 3 OSG releases since May (1.2.10, 1.2.11, 1.2.12)
   * Tested and validated dCache releases for storage group

   * Reviewing outstanding bugs in ITB ticketing systems and taking action on open tickets, validation of resolved tickets
   * Configure-osg changes made in response to feedback from admins

---+++ ITB Robot Work
   * Switched to a *django* based website for presentation of results and tests.  Test instance is [[http://itb4.uchicago.edu:8000/][here]].
   * Converted test output to use &quot;draft format&quot; for test output (cf: Trash/Trash/SoftwareTools.CommonTestFormat)


---++ Sites and Tier 3 Support

---+++ OSG Site Administrators Workshop at Vanderbilt, August 10 and 11
   * Mambelli coordinated the meeting, with the help of K. Buterbaugh (local support) and R. Snihur (CMS Tier 3 coordination, see US CMS Tier 3 workshop below)
   * The content was provided by Mambelli, Thapa and other OSG members as visible in the agenda and tutorial pages:
      * Indico (agenda, presentations and recordings): http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3429
      * Tutorials: Trash.ReleaseDocumentationSiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug10
   * There were about 40 attendees, several from new Tier 3s, most from CMS. The workshop was targeted mainly at Tier 3s. 
   * The presentations included topics like site planning and a detailed explanation of the Grid security. 
   * The hands-on tutorials included network tuning/troubleshooting, and installations of GUMS, compute and storage elements (Xrootd, !BeStMan-gateway, !BeStMan-Hadoop). 
   * Several new services were installed during the workshop.

---+++ Tier 3 
   * Mambelli helped R. Snihur organize the US CMS Tier 3 workshop in August (at Vanderbilt back to back after the OSG site administrators workshop), then participated and provided OSG support.
   * Coordination of Tier 3 web in OSG twiki
      * Mambelli is owner and author of most of the documents and reviewed the other documents
         * A number of new documents were added
         * Several documents required improvement, updates or changes after the reviewing.
         * Some sets of instructions have been tested (newly tested or re-tested after changes in the software), specifically: cluster systems, local Condor job scheduler installation, Xootd storage system, client tools.
   * !BeStMan-gateway and !BeStMan-Xrootd installation procedures have been tested and debugged
   * Sakrejda maintains a OSG production site at NERSC/PDSF serving as the US ATLAS Tier 3 for the LBNL group
   * Work included another round of debugging the SGE Gratia probe; designed and distributed a work-around;  worked with the probe custodian on implementing a permanent fix.


---+++ Site coordination and support
   * Organization of the monthly site coordination meeting: Mambelli takes care of topic selection, meeting convocation, coordination and minutes
   * OSG Campfire Chat
      * Each of the 3 shifters covers 3.5 hours/week of regular shift plus voluntary work, substitutions and interventions as needed
   * Mambelli participates at the weekly VO call and provides solution or facilitation of problems raised during the call involving OSG sites

   * Continue to support customized tools for US ATLAS:
      * =wlcg-client=;  =wlcg-client-lite= (a reduced package set) was added in February, which included integration and testing with ATLAS Canada framework as part of OSG Tier 3 support.
 
---+++ Test virtual cluster
   * Mambelli is maintaining a (laptop-scale) virtual test cluster.  It is based on the !VmWare ESX server with the following VMs: router/firewall, 7 SL 5.4 hosts, NFSv4 server, several installations of cluster and OSG components
   * The cluster has been used VTB/ITB installation testing, documentation testing, and Tier 3 configuration testing.


---++ Validation Testbed
   * Tested several VTB releases 
   * Maintaining a VTB site, certificates, upgrades, security patching. (The VTB consists of CE, SE, GUMS+PBS batch system). Thapa fully admins this small site (4 systems).
