Key Initiatives
   1. Improving perfSONAR-PS toolkit for OSG
   2. Achieve stable operations of Network service
   3. Outreach and community interaction

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. OSG modular dashboard service / OSG network service: addressing lingering problems from initial deployment. OSG datastore too fragile; recovery from datastore service interruptions takes too long;  message bus pipeline interruptions can cause clients to lose data.
   2. Must develop procedures for the data migration process. About 1 year left before absolutely needed.
   3. Getting better engagement from US LHC sites.  

Key Accomplishments
   1. OSG perfSONAR published to CERN Active MQ bus being used by both ATLAS and LHCb
   2. Development: MadAlert initial version ready. Improvements to OMD/Check_mk probes ready for deployment. New version of mesh-config finalized.
