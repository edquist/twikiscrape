---++ Attendees
Alain, Chander, Mine, Dan, Brian, Gabriele
---++ New Items for [[https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=86][OSG Calendar]] 
Jemise will update Indico

---++ Follow-up Action Items

1) Mine to follow-up with GOC to make sure all our services can work in a SHA-2 environment

2) Mine to communicate with VOs and inform them about the SHA-2 transition; help VOs test and evolve their software if there is an impact from SHA-2 in the VO application layer

---++ Software - Alain Roy

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * *Support ongoing deployment of OSG Software 3 (RPMs)*
      * 35 CEs are running OSG Software 3
      * 67 sites are running previous versions of OSG Software
   * *SHA-2 transition* &lt;br&gt; I had let work on the SHA-2 slide a bit due to a misunderstanding of the deadline. Current understanding:
      * CAs may transition as early as January 2012
      * WLCG is looking for a way to delay the need to fully transition deployed software by then (extra CA? Convince IGTF CA&#39;s to continue using SHA1?)
      * Bestman2: Area of biggest concern. Neha owns it and is focusing her effort on conversion to jGlobus 2. Initial effort suggests a lot of work remains to be done, so it is a worry.
   * *Support Digicert transition*
      * Packaging of the CA certs
      * Helping with evaluation of software acceptance
   * *Upgrade HDFS*
      * Major upgrade for CMS
      * Owned by Doug Strain
      * Good progress--initial test version complete, sorting through issues

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Globus problems within ATLAS* &lt;br&gt; ATLAS is recommending that ATLAS sites do not upgrade to OSG Software 3 until this problem is resolved.&lt;br&gt;[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/12486][GOC Ticket #12486]].&lt;br&gt;Short description: State of jobs submitted from Condor-G to SWT2 site aren&#39;t propagating properly, which causes other problems (don&#39;t know how many jobs are running, have run, or need to be submitted)
   * *SHA-2* (see above)

---+++ Recent accomplishments

   * *Two software releases in July* &lt;br&gt; [[Documentation.Release3.Release316][OSG Software 3.1.6]] &lt;br&gt; [[Documentation.Release3.Release317][OSG Software 3.1.7]]
      * Bug fixes (RSV, Xrootd/LCMAPS integration, HDFS, Bestman2)
      * Improved Bestman2 handling
      * Enhanced Condor GRAM job manager
      * Other miscellaneous
   * *Support for CREAM 2 evaluation* &lt;br&gt; (being done by the Technology team):
      * Fully packaged and working CREAM client tools
      * Fully packaged and mostly working CREAM server: still solving issues in submitting jobs

---+++ Questions for other area coordinators
   * Mine: What can we do to support Pakiti? I understand we need to package some (special?) version of Pakiti, but I don&#39;t know what it is or where to get it.
   * Brian: Recent discussions with Jorge (CMS Tier 3 site admin) reminded me that you prototyped a version of glexec/lcmaps without using the Condor procd. It would simplify glexec deployment if we used that. What needs to be done to make it happen?
   * Dan: I gave a talk to EPSCoR students yesterday about HTC, Condor, and OSG. A student from Rice asked me an interesting question: &quot;Assuming Condor is right for my needs, would it be possible to install it on an HPC server that already has its own task scheduler?&quot; Should I put him in touch with you as a potential BOSCO user?
