The Open Science Grid is being used to help solve one of the most famous problems in mathematical coding theory.

The Football Pool Problem gets its name from a lottery-type game in which participants predict the outcome of soccer matches.The current challenge is to find the minimum number of lottery tickets a person would have to buy to guarantee that for six matches, no more than one prediction (out of 729 possible outcomes) is wrong. In the language of mathematical coding theory, that translates to determining the smallest covering code of ternary words of length six.

Jeff Linderoth of Lehigh University, Francois Margot from Carnegie Mellon University and Greg Thain from the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a mathematical application to search for a solution to the Football Pool Problem. The application was initially adapted to run on the Grid Laboratory of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s campus grid. In the spring of 2006, Dan Bradley of DISUN, the Data Intensive Science University Network, developed services to route GLOW jobs to OSG sites.

After decades of study, researchers had only been able to reduce the minimum number of tickets to between 65 and 73. In five months using GLOW and OSG resources in combination with computing resources from DISUN and the TeraGrid, over 90 CPU years have been spent to establish that the answer must be between 70 and 73.

The Football Pool Problem can be formulated as a numerical optimization problem known as an integer program. The most powerful mechanism for solving IP models is a procedure known as branch-and-bound, and it is a variation on this procedure that is employed in the collaboration’s search for the solution to the Football Pool Problem. The distributed application of branch-and-bound passes portions of a very large search space to participating processors, with each processor reporting the results of its search back to a controlling process. Scaling the branch-and-bound algorithms to the level necessary to solve an instance of the magnitude of the Football Pool Problem was an engineering challenge, and the large size of the search space made the quantity of available CPU power on the grid essential for progress towards a final solution.

Solutions to the Football Pool Problem and other closely-related problems have broad-ranging applications, including the design of more efficient data compression and numerical integration schemes, distributed cryptographic systems and computer hardware. The techniques and software developed during the search for a solution may also pave the way for solving many other classes of integer problems, or for implementing tree-search algorithms on loosely-coordinated resources like those available via the OSG.
