---++ Mine Altunay - Security

---+++ Key Projects
   * Came back from the maternity leave on May 24th. Previous reports were handled by Dave Dykstra
   * OSG CA transition successfully completed when I was on leave. As of end if June our contract with DigiCert expired and we are successfully using CILogon OSG CA. Jeny is working on a contingency and close-out report. Afterwards, we will be officially done with this project. 
   * FIFE Experiments have been transitioning to CILogon Basic CA. This is a very big change for Fermilab. Fermi operated Kerberos CA is going away and being replaced by the CILogon Basic CA. The transition will end at the end of September. No major issues so far. Our talk on this change wll be given at NSF Cybersecurity summit. 
   * Susan Sons have joined our team. She will be the OSG Security Officer after April 2017. One of my goals this year is to make sure we can have a successful transition from me to Susan. We worked on the security work plan together, I want her to be comfortable with the projects continuing after the April date. I will not start any big projects that will run past April unless Susan wants to work on them, too. 
   * CMS Security Officer. I was mainly spending my CMS related time on HEPCloud security model. But, after a recent meeting with CMS management, we decided to change this and have me focus on CMS related issues only. This means I will be still in close contact with OSG even after my term ends with OSG. 
   * Invited to WISE workshop. Jeny will give a talk on OSG security.


---+++Operations
   * Jeny and Dave did a great job while I was gone. 
   * DOS attack on opensciencegrid.org. No damage has been done. Small downtime. The vulnerability is diagnosed as a standard wordpress feature that allows remote posting.  This feature has been turned off. 
   * Anand is working on a new security drill. 
   * dcache, hdfs, iperf3, openssl vulnerabilities. Announcements sent out and impacted parties are contacted separately. 
   * a root level vulnerability impacting all GOC machines have been found by Dave and fixed by GOC. 
   * Oasis security drill has been conducted. 
   * Approving a new automated method to generate host certificate. The request is brought by the BNL team. They wanted to have apuppet based system where cert generation is automatically monitored and managed. 
   * WLCG is transitioning to fully rfc-compliant proxies. We tested the OSG and FIFE systems once more and found no problem.

   2. Preparing new security drill. Conducted OASIS security drill.
   3. Final test of WLCG transitioning to fully rfc-compliant proxy successful.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Transitioning of security officer responsibilities from Mine to Susan. Mine will not start new projects ending after Apr if Susan is not on-board.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Contract with DigiCert expired at the end of June; we are successfully using CILogon OSG CA. Need to discuss with ET what OSG institution pays for the InCommon subscription at the level of few $1k.
   2. Sustained DOS attack to opensciencegrid.org with only a minor downtime. Vector was a posting feature in wordpress that could be turned off.
