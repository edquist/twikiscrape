Three trillion times per second--that&#39;s how fast quarks in the B sub s (Bs) particle &quot;oscillate,&quot; or switch between their matter and antimatter states, according to scientists from the Collider Detector at Fermilab collaboration. The CDF physicists measured this rapid oscillation with the help of the world&#39;s most powerful particle accelerator, Fermilab’s Tevatron, unprecedented computing power made available through the Open Science Grid and the LHC Computing Grid, and a healthy dose of ingenuity.

&quot;Bs oscillation is a very subtle and rapid effect,&quot; says Jacobo Konigsberg from the University of Florida, co-spokesperson for the CDF collaboration. &quot;It&#39;s astonishing that we can measure it at all.&quot;

Astonishing as it may be, CDF routinely measures phenomena both  subtle and rare. Recently, CDF researchers caught the rare and elusive Sigma sub b (&amp;#931;b) particle using massive amounts of  computing, and a clever, precise selection mechanism that allows interesting data to be separated from the everyday.

Both recent discoveries are significant because they provide exacting tests of, and also affirm, predictions from the Standard Model, a well-established, widely-applicable theory of fundamental particles and how they interact.



As CDF scientists seek to discover ever-rarer particles and  processes, they need ever-greater amounts of data. In turn, they  need ever more simulations (computational renderings of particle  passage through the experimental apparatus) in order to learn what  the signals from the detector might look like and how likely they are to be misled by something in the data that mimics these signals.

“CDF has been able to move all the simulation to resources on the  grid and thereby complete it in a timely fashion,” says Pavel Murat, a CDF researcher from Fermilab.

CDF developed a distributed computing system on the Fermilab site  several years ago. This system has now evolved to include OSG sites and to interface with the LHC Computing Grid. The CDF user interface has remained unchanged, allowing physicists to easily transition to using grid sites.

&quot;Our physicists are submitting jobs to the grid sites on a daily basis without thinking about what resources are on the back end,&quot; says Duke University’s Ashutosh Kotwal.

Today CDF is actively using five grid sites, has five more in the  works, and plans to expand gradually from there. The resources made available through Fermilab and the grid are currently sufficient to  handle their data simulation needs.

&quot;CDF will continue to probe the Standard Model to find its flaws and what might lie outside,” says Fermilab’s Rob Roser, CDF collaboration co-spokesperson. &quot;These recent measurements, as remarkable as they are, are just two on the path down a very rich  physics program in which we will continue to measure rarer and  rarer phenomena.”
