---++ New Homepage for the Open Science Grid
It has been quite some time since the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view][OSG homepage]] has been remodeled. A 
[[http://www-itb.opensciencegrid.org/][new OSG homepage]] will replace it during the production release scheduled for
August 13th, 2013.

The new page has a considerably different &quot;look and feel&quot;. It is aimed more at viewers not associated with the OSG.
Even so, ultimately all information currently available from the old homepage can be accessed from the new.

The new page is constructed with the confluence content management system and maintained by the OSG Grid Operations Center.

---+++ Some technical information

---+++ A required addition
I (Scott) believe we are required by Indiana University to include a link to this [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/IUPrivacyPolicy][Privacy Policy]].
Event though the page is attributed to the OSG, it is hosted on infrastructure operated by IU employees. The link can be discreet, see for example,
[[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/home][OIM]]. The content is just the facts and we have had no objections to the policies described in it.
