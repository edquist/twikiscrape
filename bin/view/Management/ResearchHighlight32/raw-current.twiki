The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a worldwide archive that provides access to experimentally determined protein structures, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. At over 40 years old, the PDB is a leading example of how a public databank can drive open access to foundational, far-reaching research. As a member of the worldwide PDB, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) PDB is a vital resource for biomedical science, used by more than 200,000 unique researchers each month.

Andreas Prli&amp;#263; is involved in almost all aspects of the project. Prli&amp;#263; is not only a senior scientist at the RCSB PDB (rcsb.org) at the University of California, San Diego, but also a project leader for !BioJava and an editor of the software section of the journal PLoS Computational Biology. He specializes in developing new tools for use with PDB data, and is currently focusing on the protein comparison tool, the sequence page, the viewer for 3D structures, and the structural similarities pages. (For more on these tools, see: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/23/2983.full.pdf+html)

Prli&amp;#263; creates algorithms to study nontrivial relationships between proteins, relationships that have been preserved through evolution. Understanding how proteins are related is important to inferring functional and evolutionary relationships between protein families – and, as a result, to drug discovery, biodefense, and genomic research. Behind most relationships are evolutionary events that impact structure; therefore Prli&amp;#263; also seeks to understand point mutations, which cause the replacement of a single nucleotide with another nucleotide of the genetic material. It&#39;s now relatively cheap to sequence genomes (and reveal overarching similarities), but small point mutations reveal key differences.

Providing up-to-date protein structure analysis poses a considerable challenge, especially with the PDB archive’s continuous growth (an average weekly update requires calculating nearly 1 million structure alignments). On one hand, researchers need faster algorithms for calculating structure alignments – that’s where Prli&amp;#263; devotes much of his time. On the other hand, they also need to easily run a large number of jobs in parallel on distributed computing resources – particularly on the Open Science Grid (OSG), which can calculate 122 million alignments in approximately 102,000 CPU hours.

With assistance from the NSF&#39;s Trash/Engagement team, Prli&amp;#263; and Chris Bizon, senior research scientist at the Renaissance Computing Institute, set up a client/server architecture for managing large calculations on the OSG. Specifically, the Trash/Engagement team helped develop the submit scripts, which interact with the OSG to provision the RCSB PDB client to appropriate OSG compute nodes. After provisioning, the RCSB PDB client contacts the external RCSB PDB server, which doles out jobs. The results are returned directly to the server, which then writes data to the database and provides further instructions to the OSG. (For more on the client/server architecture, see: http://www.renci.org/publications/techreports/TR-09-03.pdf)

Thanks to the architecture’s simplified workflow and data management, RCSB PDB researchers are able to run more parallel jobs that yield large-scale comparisons of protein structures. &quot;Before, we had to figure out how much CPU time we could get. We don&#39;t have to worry about that with the OSG. Our server controls workflow, while the OSG independently allocates resources,&quot; said Prli&amp;#263;. He also appreciates the OSG&#39;s low bureaucracy model, adding that &quot;We get access to large amounts of CPU with very little administrative overhead, and we benefit from a wide community of different entry points. Overall, we can scale up work much more than other resources would allow.&quot;
Prli&amp;#263;’s primary recommendation for other scientists looking into using the OSG is to work with problems that can be easily parallelized. &quot;Massive amounts of CPU plus easy parallelization is perfect for the OSG,&quot; he explains. Ultimately, the OSG has bolstered RCSB PDB researchers’ abilities to calculate new protein sequence clusters and missing alignments for representative chains, and to perform all-against-all comparisons of sequences and 3D protein structures – all on a weekly basis. 

As Prli&amp;#263; notes, this has broad implications for society. &quot;Proteins are like engines, in that they conduct most activities in cells. Many diseases can be linked to them – that’s why this research is so important. The underlying goals of protein analysis are diverse and include wide ranging areas of research to conquer disease, to develop more efficient washing powder, and to bolster biodefense treatments against toxic molecules.&quot;
