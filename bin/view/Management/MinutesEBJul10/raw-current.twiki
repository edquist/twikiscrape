   * There are two templates for SOW. One is for the proposal, the other is based on the draft MOU as was being prepared by Albert.


---++ Users and VO Usage and Plans - Frank, Torre

Miron is receiving daily usage  information from several sources. Are there more reports we should be asking for in the short term?  Is ML giving us monitoring that is useful? We should ask the Grid Accounting project for a status and to start sending reports as they ramp up deployment. 

VO  Use information and plans are beginning to be posted on the Twiki pages. Ilya Narsky is doing a good job starting to gather this information  for Frank and Torre but the information is not answering all the questions we have. 

At last Thursdays meeting MIron suggested we call each VO and ask them about OSG 0.6.0 needs and their plans for use of the OSG.  Ilya has been starting to phone those who do not reply to his emails. We should also make sure we keep history.  

   *  http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/WebHome 

---+++!! Comments
   * For OSG 0.6.0 we expect more statistics from services as well as usage by VOs.
   * Ilya will be gathering requirements by VOs.  Rob will consult to gather these for the purposes of the ITB release description (Trash/ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.WebHome).
   * *VO Leaders - please make sure the ITB description captures your needs*


---++ Engagement
Discussion of the current plans - Alan, Miron
   * John (John Trash.ManagementMcGee is a project manager at RENCI) - setting up a bio-portal application. Hardware is in hand at RENCI. Current focus is on workflow - eventually dynamic and user-generated.  Hope to have some discussion points and progress in advance of the August consortium meeting.
   * Paul - discussions with Mark Green - also interested in bioportal applications, sees significant overlaps and synergies with the work at RENCI. Esp. &quot;CaBiG&quot;. Would like to share information / effort on database infrastructure. 

---++ EOT
Report from the Grid Summer School - Mike
   * Workshop went very well. The best of the three so far.
   * 40 students, a diverse group (interests and from locations)
   * Pre-assigned certificates helped with getting things going initially.
   * Used the OSG and Teragrid during the class - presetup.  This added a lot to the experience.
   * Students were of a very high level, compared to previous classes (eg. early PhD students)
   * 17 CS, 9 Physics, 14 other (mech eng, ops research, cs-econ, bio-eng, ...)
   * More time on open discussions.  Eg., impressions of grid technology, and future.
   * Next time - have a prepared roadmap for what can be done *post*-workshop.
   * Ideas gathered for extending the curriculum - info systems, portal development, resource brokering.
   * An electronic survey will be given to the students.
   * Several good candidates expressed interest in continuing work in grid technology.
   * Students were enthusiastic about what could be done, format, and working together, other interactions, etc.
   * Several students from the Americas (Uraguay, Puerto Rico, Columbia)

---+++!! Comments
   * Will write up a report on the school.
   * Many students were able to run applications from their own research areas on OSG.  Eg. Network research, MPI applications, etc.)
   * Work on follow up of training material for other venues.


---++ Proposal for International Science Grid this Week
Attached is the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/edit/Management/MinutesEBJul10/ProposalforInternationalScienceGridNewsletter_v4_kly.doc][current draft]] of the proposal which Katie, Judy, and the EGEE team have worked on.
   * Katie moving to CERN for a couple of years but will remain editor of SGTW till years end.
   * Discussion with EGEE to create a joint, international position, jointly funded by EGEE and OSG.
   * Another position is possibly opening up, for US LHC communicator at CERN, as well.
   * If concerns, communicate with Ruth directly.


---++ Consortium meeting. 
The  agenda is taking shape [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/events/meetings/consmeeting0806/agenda.html][here]].
   * Please take a look for the basic organizational content.
   * There is a program committee (Ruth, Doug, Ann/ISI, Rob, Maytal, Penelope, Gordon Watts (host)

---++ Operations, Security, Software 
If Leigh and Doug are ready with the action item list and impact from the joint operations workshop they will present this. What is the current status of our Validation tools - VORS, GridEX etc.  
Don  will tell us how the Risk Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment is going and the plans for rolling out first &quot;VO Agreements for Security&quot; at the Consortium meeting. 

Alain has sent a list of the status of VDT 1.3.11.

---+++!! Comments
   * Doug - sent a list of action items from both the May ops workshop at IU, and the June joint EGEE ops workshop at CERN.  Plus some others Doug and Leigh have fleshed out.   * Leigh and Doug have gone over the list and prioritized.
   * See attached document, also: Operations.OpsActionItems
   * Need to identify effort required for items.  Unclear if we have the effort to push through each of these.
   * Example is the OSG user&#39;s guide initiated by Frank. Others as well - how to install grid applications.
   * Policy/privilege pages need to be completed.
   * Getting support centers more involved in processing certificate requests.
   * From June meeting - issue of updating &#39;on-the-fly&#39; software installations.  Depends on =pacman -update= working for specific packages.
   * OSG to GGUS ticket exchange is nearly working (Rob Quick)
   * Work needed on validating sites by accross EGEE and OSG grids.  Should involve Ilya and the ITB.
   * Scheduling downtimes - getting sites to report this to Operations.
   * Timescale for integration of these issues into the project plan - the program of work.  Those that have been previosly discussed should go in, others need to be discussed either before or at the Consortium meeting.
   
---+++ Validation
State of current validation tools. Pass for now, but discuss updates again.
   * Requirement for =pacman -update= from Operations, as targeted for VDT 1.3.12.  
   * Need to understand what is required for incremental upgrades.
   * What small changes can be updated to individual packages, in the short term.
   * Leigh will respond to mail from Alain.


---+++ Security officer report (Don Petravick)
   * See attched [[%ATTACHURL%/Agreements.pdf][powerpoint slides on Agreements]].
   * Discussion of Risk definitions, workflows, and controls at sites and with VOs.[[%ATTACHURL%/OSG-RA-004A.doc][Risk Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment Draft]]  [[%ATTACHURL%/RA-STATUS-JULY-06.pdf][Status of Risk Assessment]]
   * Comments 
      * Ruth would like to have a first draft of these concepts, with discussion at the Consortium meeting arriving at acceptance (and possible agreements) with these terms.
      * There will be a parallel session at the consortium meeting that will discuss a VO agreement in draft form.
   * Risk analysis project
      * See two attached files (long report, and powerpoint summary)
      * Expect everyone to have read this.
   * Follow-up on all these at the consortium meeting. 

---++ External project status reports
The VO privilege project is sending written status reports to the Executive Team every few weeks (when not on vacation). Are there other such reports we should be getting? Stu Martin is on vacation so wont make todays meeting. Do we know  the current status a validated WS GRAM from the Globus project? Managed space and storage on OSG. When should we have a focussed report on this? Accounting is in test at a few sites. We should schedule a discussion with Philippe on this in the next few weeks.

   * Gabriele will be sending written status reports every few weeks for VO privilege.
   * Will request regular updates from Accounting project. Starting this week. 
   * Expect to have more as the project starts.

---++ Input and feedback from recent meetings where we presented OSG

   * [[http://grid2006.jinr.ru/][Grid2006]], Dubna.  Interest expressed in directions for accounting.  Also interest by the Dubna lab to collaborate with OSG.  Suggested invitation to Consortium meeting.
   * Operations workshop - tenatively scheduled another joint operations workshop at Indiana March 2007.
   * Bill Kramer - brief talk on OSG at HPC meeting.

---++ Council, Resources Board, Science Advisory Group
Bill is working with Jerome and Howard on clarifying the makeup of the Council. 

   * Council: Bill - Jerome was working on this, but we need to iterate on something that can be agreed to at the consortium meeting.
   * RB: Ruth - would be useful to have a couple of people on the resources board populated.
   * SAG: Ruth approached Mary Anne Scott.  Bill: agreed to MAS. He will send out a call for nominations for suggested names.  How long to serve? Two years, stagger and relieve people. Start small now.
   * Agencies have said we will have a joint advisory group.  Hope they will have this in place before the consortium meeting.

---++ AOB
   * None

---++ Status of VDT 1.3.11

Miron suggested that it would be a good idea to fill in the Executive Team Plus with the details of the upcoming VDT 1.3.11 release. I agree.

===== Time Line =====
We hope to code freeze the VDT by Wednesday, July 12th.

We do at least one week of testing before release, which would set our release to be on or shortly after Wednesday, July 19th.

If we experience any delays of more than a day or two, we&#39;ll let you know about them. Due to some big changes in the VDT (particularly the new version of Globus, which contains many new patches), I would not be surprised if testing takes a bit longer than usual.

===== Major Changes =====
*  A new version of VOMS and VOMS Admin that solves several
   problems encountered by OSG users is now in the VDT.
   (Requested by OSG)

* A new version of CEmon (from gLite) which solves several
  problems, and is now ready to be used experimentally in OSG.
  (Requested by OSG)

* Fedora Core 4 on x86-64 is now supported. (Requested by LIGO)

* Squid is now part of the VDT. (Requested by OSG)

* A new version of Globus (4.0.2) with additional patches to move
  toward a common version of Globus between OSG and TeraGrid.
  (Supports OSG and TeraGrid collaboration.)

* New versions of Fetch CRL and EDG Make Gridmap. Note that these
  now run as cron jobs instead of the daemons they used to be.
  (Not requested, but sorely needed because our old versions
  were very out of date and had problems.)

* SRM V1 client, which used to be in OSG software cache, is now
  part of the VDT installation. (Requested by OSG.)

* SRM V2 client is now in the VDT.

* The NMI Build and Test software is now included in the VDT.

Details are available online at:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.11/release.html

Not all of the small details are there yet, but we&#39;ll be filling it in during our week of testing, as preparation for our release.
