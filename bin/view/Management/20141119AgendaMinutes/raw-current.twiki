---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Evaluating whether to continue operations of iRODS or look for alternatives. New iRODS requires significant integration work; demand constant but small.
   2. Growing opportunistic pool and modeling opportunistic eco-system.
   3. Tutorial for Clemson ACI-REF team to identify new researchers for OSG
   4. Support of XSEDE users on OSG. In parallel, developing priority management for the open facility.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Coordination of data with jobs at sites: common input ~30 GB, output 1 GB.
   2. Some sites claim that they won&#39;t benefit from enabling opportunistic access.
   3. Need to improve communication with potential new researchers
   4. Need to improve integration of OSG-Connect with the rest of OSG for administration and accounting

Key Accomplishments
   1. XD-Login node upgrade: now supporting 30k running jobs (monthly average 18K). At the same time, the opportunistic pool is growing. The platform is adequate; need more users.
   2. Completed NSF-compliant Field-of-Science assignments to projects
   3. Developed document on OSG &quot;sharing principles&quot; encouraging opportunistic model in support of US science
