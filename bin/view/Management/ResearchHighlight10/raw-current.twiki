Silicon nanowire transistors are promising devices for future integrated circuits. Researchers in this field are interested in properties of materials that vary on an atomic length scale; they are engrossed by quantum states, silicon nanowire geometries and the relationship between voltages and currents. 

But not all nano-device engineers are nuts for computers. They prefer to let other people worry about the computational end of things. How can this be, given that three-dimensional simulations of nanowire behavior under varying conditions are a necessary part of their research?

Enter Gerhard Klimeck of Purdue University, Technical Director of the National Science Foundation Network for Computational Nanotechnology.  He and his colleagues have developed the user-friendly NanoWire computational tool, accessible via the web-based nanoHUB. 

On nanoHUB, researchers set up a NanoWire simulation through a graphical interface that allows input of device parameters, ranges of voltages to test, and so forth. A simple click on “Simulate” transparently sends a set of parallel processes off to Open Science Grid, TeraGrid, and/or the local cluster at Purdue.   The computers send back complex and enticing electrostatic potentials and quantum eigenstates. NanoWire makes the results easy to interpret, and the researchers are on their way to optimizing transistor designs.


“Users are interested in ease of use, not Unix commands. They need to be able to set up their experiment, explore their data interactively and ask ‘what if’ questions,” says Klimeck.

Enter Saumitra R. Mehrotra and Dr. K.P. Roenker of the University of Cincinnati. According to them, one of the leading challenges to producing large scale nanoscale circuits is the variation in device performance due to the inherent variability in the fabrication process.

These researchers studied the effects on silicon nanowire MOSFET voltage characteristics of varying body thickness, gate length and gate dielectric thickness.

&quot;We ran over 500 simulations on NanoWire and gained an insight into how superior the silicon nanowire MOSFET device is (relative to traditional MOSFETs) and an understanding of its limitations,” said Mehrotra.

They were able to optimize a nanowire device design for both high performance and low operating power applications, thus advancing one of the future technologies expected to help continue the transistor scaling and extend Moore&#39;s Law.
