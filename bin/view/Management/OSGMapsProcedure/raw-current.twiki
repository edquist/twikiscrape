---+!!OSG Maps
%TOC%

OSG Maps are available from the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?map_attrs_shownr=on&amp;all_sites=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;disable_value=1&amp;gridtype=on&amp;gridtype_1=on][MyOSG portal]]

For a presentation a good solution is to use the Google Earth version of the map. 

Install [[http://earth.google.com/intl/en/][Google Earth]] on your machine. 

Download (or open directly in Google Earth) the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map/kml][MyOSG Map KML file]]. (Labeled as &quot;Google Earth Format&quot; on !MyOSG)

Once you have the map in Google Earth, you can:
   * You will probably want to rotate the map to true north by using the left and right arrows (&lt; &gt;) in the control on the upper right of the map.
   * Make the size as you want by adjusting the size of the window. The image you eventually produce will be the same pixel dimension as the map in the window.  Or you can select View -&gt; View Size -&gt; Print Output and select a fixed aspect ratio for standard papers. (View Size also has TV and computer sizes.)
   * You can adjust the zoom level with the slider on the right.

Save the image using File -&gt; Save -&gt; Save Image.

%NOTE% When you close Google Earth, do not save the items in your save folder (prompted).  If you do, the next time you load a new map, all the locations will be duplicated and labels will appear twice.  To fix this, you will have to delete the kml files from Google Earth&#39;s folder.

The old  OSG map is located in OSG Doc DB under document # 766-v8 and marked as obsolete.  One can now easily create a map using the above procedure.
