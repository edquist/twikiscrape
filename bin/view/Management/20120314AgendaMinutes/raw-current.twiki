---+++ New Items for [[https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=86][OSG Calendar]] 
Jemise will update Indico


---+++ Follow-up Action Items

   * Chander will request guidance from OSG-ET on how to handle new &quot;engagement&quot; requests from individual users.  We are getting 1-2 per month and it takes about 10 hours (best case) to get a new user running on OSG.  User support does not have adequate effort for this.  If there is a regional engagement community (e.g. HCC, GLOW, UCSD, RENCI) &quot;near&quot; the new researcher, we can refer them there.  Or we can send them to XSEDE to get an OSG allocation and rely on their support.  Or we can decline these new requests.
