---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Continue to grow opportunistic pool (focus on Fermilab and GLOW VOs). For GLOW VO, focusing on Fermilab resources.
   2. Effective service delivery for XSEDE. Addressing XdMod misreports and updating CPU h to SU conversion factor.
   3. Assist new site Florida International University  to integrate 2K cores in OSG
   4. Assist with improving performance of gFactory (e.g. evaluate new hardware)

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Need data management solution for Open Facility users. We will not integrate new iRODS with OSG storage (too much effort): maintaining current iRODS at Fermilab as-is.
   2. Need better visibility in glideinWMS for troubleshooting.
   3. OSG-Connect admin and accounting systems are not well integrated with the other &quot;networks&quot; (e.g. show single usage plot of a site from Connect and Direct)
   4. OSG Open Facility is demand limited.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Achieved yr3 goal of 100M h of opportunistic cycles for OSG VO. Yearly growth rate between 51% and 64% in the past 3 years.
   2. Tutorial with ACI-REF at Clemson. Planning next one.
   3. Updated OSG by-laws to include a &quot;sharing principle&quot;
   4. Syracuse achieved resource sharing target with OSG
