---++ Agenda

   * 1.0.2 Production Coordination – Dan Fraser _(confirmed)_

   * 1.0.4 LIGO Applications – Kent Blackburn  _(confirmed)_

   * 1.3 [[IntegrationFeb2010][Integration &amp; Sites]] – Rob Gardner _(confirmed)_

   * 1.5 Engagement - John McGee _(confirmed)_
      * temporary staffing crisis: Mats at reduced level, Chris Bizon was 50% effort on user engagement but has left the OSG project. Jason Reilly at RENCI (TG Science Gateway developer) is gaining more OSG experience and coming to 2010 AHM. Open position: http://jobs.unc.edu/1002320  this position will be 50 to 100% OSG Engage.
      * implications: very little coming from engage beyond user engagement, limited broader contribution to the community until staffing issues resolved. 
      * CMU VOSS workshop next week at CalTech. 
      * usage has been strong recently with &gt;4k jobs sitting in OSGMM consistently over the previous month. number of concurrently running jobs tends to remain between 500 and 2500.
      * recent campus grids workshop: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/WorkingMeetingFermilab
      * open action items: further document the Engage hosted infrastructure; develop response and/or plan for OSGMM given increasing usage of this package beyond the Engage vO.
