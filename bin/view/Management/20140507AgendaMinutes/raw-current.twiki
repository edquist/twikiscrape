Key Initiatives
   1. OSG Modular dashboard - ready to roll out the current prototype to production. Still need a Data-Store component.
   2. Improving perfSONAR - fixed all known bugs. Working on deployment with OSG sites
   3. Documentation: working on &quot;how-to-debug examples&quot; for Mesh config.
   4. Outreach: WLCG planning on new networking and transfer metrics WG - ensures that WLCG metrics are collected and available.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Dashboard still lacks a Data Store component. Core service for production. Evaluating whether to adapt existing or build new technology.
   2. Mesh-configuration requires more meta-data than currently gathered at the registration of new PerfSONAR sites. Rethinking registration procedure.
   3. Breadth of deployment in OSG - currently mainly WLCG.

Key Accomplishments
   1. WLCG deployment converging (8 are missing, but 6 are working on it)
