Key Initiatives
   1. Certificate-less job submission for Glow. Certified professionally administered submission nodes. Expect ~600 users to be able to submit jobs w/o certificates also to Fermilab: used up to 1,000 concurrent glideins there in the last 3 weeks.
   2. Investigating impact of switching from DigiCert CA: minor impact for users; discussing alternatives for host certificates. Experimenting with CILogon Net HSM CA - risk: uncertainty on future funding.
   3. Continuing with the development of OSG IdP connected to OIM.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. None raised

Key Accomplishments
   1. CILogon Basic CA is IGTF accredited. Users can get a &quot;unique identifier&quot; through CILogon, then the VO will ascertain their identity for VO membership.
