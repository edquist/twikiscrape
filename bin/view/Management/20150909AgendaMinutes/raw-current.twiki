---++ Stakeholder Request Management - Gabriele Garzoglio

https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10030

---++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. OSG dashboard service: OSG Ops and Network Dashboard project team agreed &quot;go live&quot; in production on Mon Sep 14
   2. Improving PerfSONAR-PS toolkit for OSG. v3.5RC2 (now out) integrated feedback from OSG testbed.
   3. Development of MadAlert, to alert on MaDDash conditions.
   4. PuNDIT satellite: testing on perfSONAR OSG testbed.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Observe a small number of discrepancies between data store and remote sites. Actively working on a fix.
   2. Need to improve allocated resources to dashboard VMs to smooth operations.
   3. Issues during &quot;normal maintenance&quot; caused downtime: concern going into production.
   4. Data migration process to cycle out old data needs to be defined. Working with ESNet
   5. Publishing network metrics from ITB to CERN causes high load on OSG; need investigating. Not on the critical path to go to production.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Full mesh of WLCG latencies target 100 instances, achieved 81; limitation / backlogs due to need for memory
   2. Datastore: produced documentation, risk assessment, and SLA in preparation to go to production on Mon Sep 14.
   3. Testing proximity service. Use case: find perfsonar instances closest to given SE&#39;s for debugging
