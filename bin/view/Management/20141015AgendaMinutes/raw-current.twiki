---++ Campus Grids - Rob Gardner


---+++ Key initiatives

   * Distributed Environment Modules
      * 57 packages now installed. 61 applications from the Xsede campus bridging list, of which 26 are targeted for DHTC on OSG.  We have 9 of those currently in OASIS.
      * Instructions and current inventory, documentation: https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/display/CON/Distributed+Environment+Modules
   * More development on &quot;tutorial&quot; command
      * tutorial modules maintained in github and connect-book
      * Available on login.osgconnect.net:&lt;pre&gt;$ tutorial
usage: tutorial name-of-tutorial
       tutorial info name-of-tutorial

Available tutorials:

   * Connect client development
      * Goal is to give campus grids a client tool:
         * Pre-installed, configured, and supported by local campus cluster admin
         * Submission to OSG via grid universe
         * Submission to local scheduler via vanilla universe, using local campus allocation
         * &quot;connect&quot; and &quot;tutorial&quot; commands
         * modules command: allow switching between local modules collection and OASIS modules
   * Software Carpentry + OSG Campus Bootcamp
      * Working with User Support and Lauren Michael to hold co-branded training event January 15-16, 2015 (Madison)
      * Targeted for new users to scientific computing: go from an intro to the Unix command line to running jobs on OSG in 2.5 days.
      * Preliminary syllabus: http://dmbala.github.io/2014-09-29-UC-Test/ 
   * Working with Syracuse (Orange Grid), expanded discussion to include local LIGO group.  Signed them up to evaluate OSG Connect.


---+++ Top Issues/Concerns
   * Preparing for SWC-OSG bootcamp
   * Organizing tutorial modules for re-use, e.g. ACI-REF webinars


---+++ Key Accomplishments
   * Distributed modules in production with OASIS, actively adding new modules.  System in place to track usage statistics, will provide public interface.



---++ Stakeholder Request Management - Gabriele Garzoglio

https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10030

---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Development of Connect client to provide job submission to different environments.
   2. Training: Development of &quot;tutorial&quot; command.
   3. Growing the user base: LIGO is evaluating OSG Connect at Orange Grid.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Software Carpentry + OSG Campus Bootcamp event for Jan 15-16, 2015 (Madison): this is a first time experience.
   2. Organizing &quot;tutorial&quot; modeules for reuse through different media (summer school, webinars, etc.)

Key Accomplishments
   1. Software distribution via OASIS, defining environment through modules: 57 packages supported now. Actively adding modules. Keeping statistics on used modules at sites.
