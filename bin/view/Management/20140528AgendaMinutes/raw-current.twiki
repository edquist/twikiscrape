---++ Minutes

HTCondor-CE has initial adopters (UNL, Fermilab CMS T1, etc.).

Today, we still need support for GRAM because of WLCG testing tool and beta support of SGE &amp; LSF in HTCondor-CE (Atlas admins available for further testing).

Agree to form a transition team from Ops, Technology, and Security.
Brian: recommend representative from US Altas and CMS on the transition team to drive the urgency of the tests.

WLCG T1 and T2 are on board with the transition by fall 2014 (TBD). All others at a later date.

Target the same site architecture as for GRAM - one CE per cluster, although HTCondor-CE can support 1 CE for many clusters

Add HTCondor-CE tests to RSV.
Need to devise mechanism to count GRAM vs. HTCondor-CE.
Can&#39;t think of other services not integrated.

Organize security incident response drill and training with UNL in Jul 2014. Formal security review will be scheduled independently.

Define list of early adopters.

After HTCondor-CE becomes default (Jan 2015), maintain the GRAM package in the distribution, but do not configure it anymore. Send appropriate notifications to users.

Need to define acceptance criterion for successful transition. Will solicit input at the ops meeting from WLCG.
