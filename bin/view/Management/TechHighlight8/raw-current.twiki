The Grid is all about resource sharing. Grid facilities make their computational and storage resources available over the internet for use by others through gateway middleware. When sharing a resource, it is crucial to give users the appropriate privileges, but this task can be daunting when multiple Grids need to interoperate. That is the hurdle over which the Authorization Interoperability Project jumped.

To access the Grid, a user presents her credentials—certification that she has rights to access Grid resources—to a resource gateway. The gateway in turn talks to a local authorization system to assign the appropriate privileges to the user.  Because they are so central to the operations of any Grid, authorization systems have been developed since the early days, usually independent of other Grids. This meant that if one Grid wanted to share a resource gateway developed for its environment, it could not deploy it on another Grid without major code development.  

The idea for the Interoperability Project began a few years ago from white board drawings during various meetings in Amsterdam.   “We were all trying to figure it out. We had these tools that made resources available over the Grid and made the authorization decisions,” said Oscar Koeroo, a security middleware developer at Nikhef, the national institute for subatomic physics in the Netherlands. “By drawing how each of the grids worked and had implemented their middleware, we saw ways to expand upon what each group could do with each other’s middleware.”

Around October 2007, EGEE, Open Science Grid, and Globus came together to agree on a common protocol for resource gateways to talk to authorization systems.

First, a common language to express authorization information and common sets of attributes, for example, to express user identity, were agreed upon.  Then a library implementing the protocol was developed. All this provided the fundamental blocks necessary to create an interoperable authorization infrastructure.

&quot;By speaking the same language, we no longer needed separate implementations of libraries for authorization,” said Gabriele Garzoglio of Fermilab, a leader in the Interoperability Project. “We could now share functionalities between Globus, OSG, and EGEE, basing our software on a common code base.”

 “In the end, you have more freedom of choice on what solution you can install,” said Koeroo. “After this project, middleware isn’t bound to be installed on the Grid infrastructure it was initially developed for. For example, in the case of dCache, parts were made by Brookhaven and others by Fermilab, and they were adjusted to work with any Grid authorization system.”

The Interoperability Project provided several benefits:  First, software that was developed in EGEE, for example, now can be seamlessly deployed on OSG and vice versa simply by changing software configuration. Second, it is much easier to deploy software out of the box on a production Grid because it naturally interfaces with the authorization system. Third, a standard set of libraries to implement a common protocol was developed; these can be shared, meaning less code maintenance.

Frank Siebenlist, a project member whose earlier work with OASIS&#39; XACML Technical Committee set the standards for the common authorization language used for the project, said, “We should all pat ourselves on the back. It just doesn’t happen too often that different entities work so well together.”
