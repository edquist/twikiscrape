---++ OSG Software: 3 Main Points

While there are lots of details below, there are three things I&#39;d like to make sure you remember:

   1. All of the software we plan to ship is feature complete and in testing or production.
   1. Our major focus right now is on testing and fixing problems we find. 
   1. We have a couple of interesting Globus issues (below) that we are addressing. 

---++ OSG Software: Status &amp; Achievements

[[SoftwareTeam.RPMTimeline][Detailed Status]]

---+++ RPM Transition

   * All RPM-based software promised for 2011 is feature-complete and in testing. 
   * We have done a _limited release_ of VOMS and the CA certificates. It has been deployed in production for:
      * [[https://hcc-voms.unl.edu:8443/voms/hcc][HCC]]
      * [[https://osg-engage.renci.org:8443/voms/Engage][Engage]]
      * [[https://glow-voms.cs.wisc.edu:8443/voms/GLOW][GLOW]]
   * We are preparing to do a _limited release_ of the worker node client, client, and glexec next week. 
   * We are on target to have _general releases_ of everything by December 13, 2011. Everything means the following software as RPMs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and variants (Scientific Linux 5 &amp; Centos 5):
      * VOMS
      * Worker node &amp; glexec
      * Client
      * Compute Element &amp; RSV
      * Bestman, Xrootd, and HDFS
   * We had a documentation fest two weeks ago. Much of our documentation is in good shape, while other parts (particularly the Compute Element) still have large holes. 
   * Testing has ramped up:
      * Worker node &amp; glexec deployed at Nebraska, CMS Tier 1 ITB site, and Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed
      * Compute Element deployed at CMS Tier 1 ITB site, and Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed. Nebraska will likely deploy soon. 
      * Evaluation Team (UCSD) has tested !GridFTP (looks great) and is testing GRAM (some problems, see below)
      * Testing has found several problems, and we&#39;re fixing them as fast as we can.

---+++ LIGO Packaging Work

We are preparing packages for a subset of the VDT for LIGO on Scientific Linux 6 and Debian 6. These packages are in testing, nearing production readiness. 

---+++ Effort

Since we last spoke: 
   * Tanya has left the OSG Software Team (now on Gratia &amp; user support)
   * Neha has returned from leave

---++ OSG Software: Issues

There are several technical issues that need to be resolved. So far, none are blockers. Some of the highlights:
   * Globus 5.2.0 hasn&#39;t been released, and there are some significant bug fixes that will be coming soon. One of them might cause challenges for smooth upgrades: we&#39;re working on this with Globus. (Technical detail: in order to be accepted into EPEL, Globus has had two change version numbers in their shared libraries. This induces complexities in building our software and for users doing upgrades.)
   * Terrence Martin (OSG evaluations @ USCD) has been testing Globus GRAM. He&#39;s run into problems when there are many jobs: some of the jobs executing in the batch system fail. We are working on this with Globus. 
   * There have been some minor problems in having the correct environment set up for jobs. These are mostly resolved, with one known problem left.
   * ATLAS has some challenging requirements for installing the LFC software Python bindings. There are a couple of obstacles to getting this right, but we&#39;re working through them.
   * Our internal testing infrastructure (for nightly tests) is behind schedule significantly. This is due in part of Tim Cartwright being moved to LIGO (and it took longer than originally expected) and his education efforts. I plan to move Mat Selmeci into this effort son. 
   * We are planning to take over maintenance of Bestman 2 shortly. There will be significant ramp-up time for this effort, then an estimated ongoing 25% FTE to maintain it.
