---+GlueX Experiment

GlueX is a new fixed-target particle physics experiment that is being constructed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory (Jefferson Lab) to take advantage of the 12 GeV electron beam that will be available from the Jefferson Lab accelerator once the 12 GeV upgrade is complete.  When the experiment begins taking data in 2015, it is expected to produce about 2 PB of data per year.  The GlueX collaboration is gearing up to use the Open Science Grid to address the challenges entailed in analyzing these large amounts of data.

The scientific goal of the GlueX experiment is to provide critical data needed to address one of the outstanding and fundamental challenges in physics – the quantitative understanding of the confinement of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Confinement is a unique property of QCD and understanding confinement requires an understanding the soft gluonic field responsible for binding quarks in hadrons. Hybrid mesons, and in particular exotic hybrid mesons, provide the ideal laboratory for testing QCD in the confinement regime since these mesons explicitly manifest the gluonic degrees of freedom. Photoproduction is expected to be particularly effective in producing exotic hybrids but there is little data on the photoproduction of light mesons. GlueX will use the coherent bremsstrahlung technique to produce a linearly polarized photon beam. A solenoid-based hermetic detector will be used to collected data on meson production and decays with statistics after the first year of running that will exceed the current photoproduction data in hand by several orders of magnitude.
