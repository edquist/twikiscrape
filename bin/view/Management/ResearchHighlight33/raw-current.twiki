Patricia Clayton and the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ([[http://nees.org][NEES]] )research team are striving to make buildings more resilient during earthquakes. While they are focused on saving lives and giving people more time to evacuate, that’s only the beginning. Ultimately, the team is working to reduce the economic impact of earthquakes and get communities back up and running more quickly. As Clayton puts it, “We want to go beyond saving lives to make more resilient buildings and communities.&quot; The Open Science Grid is doing its part through extensive simulations that might not otherwise be possible.

NEES is funded by the National Science Foundation to develop earthquake- and tsunami-resistant structures such as the Self-Centering Steel Plate Shear Wall system (see Patricia Clayton’s MS [[http://nees.org/resources/4984][thesis]]). These walls use thin steel plates -- as opposed to the thick concrete walls commonly used to resist earthquake loads in buildings today -- to better maintain building integrity. The self-centering capabilities of the structural system also have the potential to reduce the time and cost of making repairs after damage from a seismic event. Most modern building codes are well established and concentrate on saving lives; this NEES research aims to preserve livelihoods as well.

Hands-on research into earthquake-resistant buildings is expensive and time-consuming. It takes considerable resources and large spaces to build a two-story wall and push it around with the magnitude of forces that earthquakes can produce. Plus, physical models can only test a couple walls and a few variations. Robust computer simulations help by verifying that a new system behaves as expected and with less damage. Simulations can also look at a broader range of walls and earthquake ground motion records. In particular, the NEES team uses !OpenSees (the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) software on the OSG for predicting the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems.

Patricia Clayton, a NEES researcher and graduate student in structural engineering at the University of Washington, wrote about !OpenSees in the March 2011 OSG Newsletter. Back in 2011, Clayton reported that the OSG User Support team had spent eight weeks working with NEES to integrate !OpenSees with the OSG infrastructure. She says that the support team has been indispensable since- while she needed their help with tailoring submission files at first, the learning curve was not steep. Clayton also reports that what they learned in helping NEES get started on the OSG should translate well to other !OpenSees researchers.

Prior to using the OSG, the NEES community took advantage of resources on the !TeraGrid. Thirty seconds of simulated ground motion can take hours to run, so OSG&#39;s opportunistic computing model has allowed for running more analyses. Clayton still puts considerable time into designing a broad range of walls and testing under a broad range of loadings, but she no longer worries about using up computing resources and taking away from other researchers in the NEES community. To make the most of the OSG, Clayton recommends that new OSG users take advantage of the expertise of the development team to troubleshoot and debug. In her experience, the team responds very quickly to support tickets and requests for help.

Recently, Clayton had the opportunity to test an actual physical model of the Self-Centering Steel Plate Shear Wall system at a huge lab in Taiwan. Over the course of three months, her team built a two-story wall and subjected it to different levels of excitation based on their computer simulations. Their real world testing showed that the wall’s innovative self-centering system reduced damage and promoted re-centering. While Clayton is pleased to have validated the research, she notes that physical models can only assess a few variations, compared to the broad range analytical models can examine when paired with the OSG. “We can only build and test so much in real life, so the OSG helps with verifying that a new system works under a broader range of conditions -- meaning people and communities as a whole will be better protected from seismic events.”
