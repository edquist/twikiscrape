Key Initiatives
   1. Extend use of OSG Connect.
   2. FreeSurfer (computational neuroscience) - now running a Pegasus workflow through OSG Connect that delivers processing of a typical MRI image. Users can upload an image and use FreeSurfer for processing.
   3. Collaborate with Xenon1Ton experiment at Gran Sasso. UChicago acts as the equivalent a T1 for the group. Data transfers via SRM to OSG Stash. Reconstruction is now done in EGI and analysis in OSG. Scale 10k jobs. Now validating also reconstruction in OSG. Results will be presented at a workshop at the University of Columbia tomorrow.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. XD requested 9M hours for next quarter from last meeting, while we pledge 2M hours total. We will approve the requests, but we need to be careful about how to satisfy the request. 1/3 of that was from Icecube (already using OSG).
   2. Posting replacement for 0.5 FTE of David for user support. Identified candidate.
   3. Data access and StashCache: interested in demonstrating the use of StashCache with a data challenge for an internal team, before offering the service for general users.

Key Accomplishments
   1. XD users of OSG Connect: in the last 90 days, 78 new user accounts and 18 new projects. This is a significant increase. Observe a lot of workflows: 2k-4k jobs running; 1 user ran 14k jobs; in last 90 days, 40 users submitted at least 10 jobs. Users like the variety of available modules
   2. Software Carpentry at Duke: successful. Challenge is retention and follow up: need to improve engagement. Next software carpentry in Nebraska.
