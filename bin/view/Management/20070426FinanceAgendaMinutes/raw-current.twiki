---++ Agenda (see presentation outline)

---+++ Year 1 Status



---++++ Statements of Work Status Report

This is a time consuming process that takes place at a lot of different locations - anything that improves efficiency is important.

Need statement that this SOW is under the assumption of funding levels persisting (Language needs to be wordsmith&#39;ed)

We should be able to improve the process, year one was a learning experience.

Provide good examples from first year that show small group SOW and large group SOW for use in year two.

Propose that WBS is agreed to by all participants. The coupling of statement of work to WBS is a complex issue that needs careful consideration.

Recommendation to have instructions to PIs (we may have new PIs in the future) for what is required to move SOW forward.

Figuring out how to work with two funding agency is part of our research.

---++++ Budget Allocation and Usage

Several institutions are burning old money before burning new money resulting in slower startup spending. 

Since the spending profile is skewed by old money spending, the importance of reporting to track progress is very important, but needs to be structured such that it isn&#39;t too labor intensive - There are several key hires outstanding that are impacting the abilities to track.

Slide 9 column &quot;Total Year 1 Budget&quot; should read &quot;One Year NSF + First 6 months DOE = Total&quot;

Expensed shown on slide 9 also reflect what has been invoiced to UW Madison not what has been spent by the institutions. There are lags between what Chander has been informed of and what institutions have spent.

We should not make conclusions based on the invoiced expenses - it is limited information but we have a requirement to report this to the funding agencies each quarter so this is requred information.

---++++ Mid Year Budget Updates

Intent is to permit rollover, may have to issue &quot;no cost extenstion&quot;. Trying to find an automated way to address. Implications at the project level to complete tasks that are not finished at the end of the one year term needs to be understood wrt how to keep the funds available beyond the year one to get the task completed to the project.

Institutional overhead increases also visible from universities and NSF budgeting

---++++ Staffing Changes

Trash/Engagement via the UNC-CH is limited to one year in current budget. It is the Executive Director responsibility to take action to assure engagement continues to be funding. Need to track potential gap in funding given next round &quot;call for proposals&quot;.

---++++ Change Request Process

[[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=523][Change Control Process Document]]

Made some changes to improve process. Machinery of change control is beginning to execute as it should.

---++++ Status Reporting and WBS Update Process

Cultural changes to migrate to a project mode. Periodic get-togethers has been shown to be useful in other big science projects. One suggestion is to keep a metric on reporting responsiveness, possibly in a spreadsheet. Can we find modivational means of keeping up? This is a broad issue ranging from monthly &quot;level of effort&quot; to quarterly &quot;PI and area coordinator&quot; reports. Question: should we capture this as a metric for the reporting agencies to have visibility into?

---+++ Year 2 Status (Planning)



---++++ Key Planning Meetings

These meeting dates were presented and agreed to at the Trash/Trash/Blueprint meeting last week. Should have been sufficiently advertized a this point. 

---++++ Planning Considerations

What do we do with unspent money, say from a delay in hiring: Should take back the budget and re-allocate, possibly to a different institution or into contengency (Jim Yeck&#39;s recommendation). Would be useful to move this into contengency so that it could be reallocated as a group with social support.


---++++ Planning Proposal : High-Level Milestones

We have to start year two planning now. Details of this table (slide 18) will evolve, but it captures top level plan.

This is a back fill assuming a completion date of September 30th 2007.

Comments (jim Yeck): In project mode you have longer term goals than seen in yearly goals. Work plans only need to be changed when you have to change them, leaving remaining long term plans in place. Funding from agencies was not delayed to the point that it impacted OSG (need to check when money arrived at UW Madison). Historically, NSF funding arrival has been slower to show up than has been seen from DOE. Ice Cube had an agreement with NSF to be able to deal with funding showing up slower than anticipated award date.

Need to get year two planning ready on a timescale that works well with the planning of the OSG review with the agencies.

Add a step to invite input from Executive Board, to construct a &quot;shopping list&quot;
