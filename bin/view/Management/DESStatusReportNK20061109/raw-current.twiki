Right now I have finished the DES simulation production.
In general the production goes well. We have produced 10 TBytes of
data in about two weeks. As usually the Fermilab sites I have used are the best. Those are FNAL_GPFARM, USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE, SDSS_TAM.
Other sites either not supporting networking on worker nodes or have some other problems.
From the outside world I was using BNL_ATLAS_1 (after they fixed NFS problem), CIT_CMS_T2 and UC_Teraport. On these sites I can use the same schema of production as on Fermilab, but in general those sites are less reliable. On all of them from time to time jobs are held due to
Globus error7: an authorization operation failed.
From time to time jobs begin fail with no output produced, so I can not find the reason, but resubmitted to other site they finish OK.
Finally some jobs stay running in Condor queue forever without producing any output. Killed and resubmitted on the same site the job finishes OK

This is about the recent production of the DES simulation.
We are planning to continue the second phase of the production next year with the output 5 times higher then now. so it will be about 50 TBytes.

Communication with GOC was OK, I&#39;ve got responses from some sites management explaining that they do not support globus-url-copy initiated from the worker node. The GRASE-CCR-U2 promises to fix some problem connected with SDSS VO, but the site is not usable and frankly speaking I have doubts it will be ever.

That&#39;s all I can report now.

Regards.
                  NK.
