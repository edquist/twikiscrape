---++ 1.0.9 Technology Group
---+++ What is running significantly late and thus needs attention
1.0.9.3 Publish quarterly reports to the OSG-EB &amp; OSG-ET on issues, actions, and recommendations resulting from the work of the Technology group. 

Not yet. I&#39;ve given a draft of an email report to Brian for review.

---+++ What WBS items have been completed
1.0.9.1 Coordinate OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Meetings - about 3 times a year 

The attempt to co-schedule during Condor Week fell through. I&#39;d like to try to co-schedule again with something in the Midwest in July. 

---+++ What WBS items need to be added/removed and why

Trash/Trash/Blueprint maintenance item. Added yet? 

---+++ Other concerns

A key topic for the next Trash/Trash/Blueprint meeting should be to decide on a defined process by which issues/ideas will move from first appearance to final resolution (e.g. discard, postpone, hand off to implementers, alter or merge with other ideas). 

Started a technology investigation (with ExTENCi and glideinWMS project) on incorporating virtualized resources into OSG.  Project description available on DocDB.
