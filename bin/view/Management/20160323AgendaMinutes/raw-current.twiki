Key Initiatives
   1. 69M h in the last quarter (up from 57M) mainly due to LIGO and AMS activity.
   2. IceCube runs through the GLOW FE. They used ~40k h of GPUs in 2015. Planning to add GPUs from Comet and XSEDE. SBGrid is the next driver for GPU usage.
   3. Fermilab experiments are ramping up using OSG - Now NOvA and uboone, in addition to mu2e. Memory footprint is the main limiting factory.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. OSG VO is now dominated by large physics experiments, LIGO and AMS. Because we consider them high priority, all other communities get 1/4 of the available slots. This is meant to be a temporary situation: need to monitor.
   2. Evolution of accounting system with the goal to retire Gratia by end 2016: need input on who is overseeing the project.

Key Accomplishments
   1.  Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) - bootstrapped the community; ramped up at a peak of 18k in a few days. Now at 4.5M hours in 5 weeks.
