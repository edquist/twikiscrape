---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Working with GLOW to enable certificate-free jobs with traceablity.
   2. Reducing the number of worker node certificates from 5,000. This number is mainly due to GridFTP servers, then to the need to upgrade to new gLExec, which does not require certificates anymore.
   3. Trash/Trash/Integration of OSG OIM identities with OSGConnect.
   4. Certificate-free access to storage

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Certificate-less jobs: professionally managed schedulers e.g. by GLOW, can be enabled; PI managing individual schedulers may not have enough tools to identify users.

Key Accomplishments
   1. OSG Operations developed a prototype system and workflow to simplify the creation of accounts at OSGConnect using OSG OIM identities.
   2. CILogon Basic CA adoption at 6 sites for ~ 40% of total wall clock time in OSG.
