---+ Designing Proteins from Scratch


Molecular modelers are using the OSG to identify novel protein sequences that fold into specific structures and bind target molecules.

Proteins are the ultimate nanomachines.  They perform sophisticated actions on a smaller scale than any device created by humans.  Proteins can enhance chemical reaction rates by over ten orders of magnitude, they can transfer chemical energy into mechanical force, and they can be used to create highly controllable signaling networks.  Naturally occurring proteins are the product of thousands of years of evolution and natural selection, but the basis for their activity is grounded in the rules of chemistry and physics.  Thus, it is not surprising that for the last 30 years researchers have been trying to learn how to design proteins.  Proteins are unlike many polymers in that most functional proteins adopt a unique three dimensional structure.  The specific arrangement of key chemical groups in a protein allows it to bind other molecules and in some cases catalyze chemical reactions.  Because a protein’s structure is directly related to its function, most research in the area of protein design has focused on the problem of creating well defined structures.


Scientists in the Kuhlman laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) are using the OSG to design proteins that adopt specific three dimensional structures and more ambitiously bind and regulate target proteins important in cell biology and pathogenesis.  To perform these calculations they are using the molecular modeling program Rosetta.  Rosetta, originally created in David Baker’s laboratory at the University of Washington, is now maintained and developed by over 8 groups at universities across the world (http://www.rosettacommons.org/ ).  Rosetta has been used successfully to predict the high resolution structures of proteins and design proteins with novel binding properties and folds.  Designing novel protein structures is computationally demanding because it requires searching both amino acid sequence space and conformational space for low energy sequence-structure pairs.  The strategy used by Rosetta to search these multi-dimensional spaces is to perform thousands of independent simulations that sample different regions of structure space.  Fortunately, these simulations do not need to be run in parallel but rather can be farmed out to large numbers of independent processors.  For this reason, the distributed framework of OSG is ideal for performing protein design simulations.

 
After computationally sampling large numbers of structures and sequences, the lowest energy sequence-structure pairs are picked out for experimental validation.  Genes are chemically synthesized for the designed proteins and the proteins are expressed and purified in the laboratory.  High resolution structure determination is used to verify if the proteins adopt the target structure and binding assays are used to determine if they bind their target structures.  While the successful design of a novel protein interaction still remains an unattained goal, there has been encouraging success in the design of protein recognition loops, the enhancement of protein stability and binding affinity as well as the design of protein conformational switches.
