perfSONAR-Performance-Toolkit (CD deployments)
   * 3.1.2 (Jan) and 3.1.3(Apr) released since last update to address bugs and security updates
   * Drafting a statement of software support to aid in adoption by Tier 2/3 sites (Still following open-source support model. No guarantee of updates on a set time scale, but every effort will be made to respond to critical fixes as quickly as possible.)
   * Drafting a security recommendations document to outline supported software and OS versions as well as considerations such as firewalls
   * Next major release in early summer
      * Redhat based
      * Updated analysis GUIs
   * LHC USAtlas
      * Aiding USATLAS in hardware evaluations to recommend for Tier 3s
      * Anticipating Trash/Tier3 ramp up in late spring/early summer
      * Already beginning to engage in network debugging exercises with USATLAS participants now that tools have been stably deployed for a while
         * BNL to/from UC and UTexas Austin
   * LHC USCMS
      * Working with CMS participants and VOs (REDDnet) to instrument and make network data available
      * Encouraging adoption of pSPT similar to ATLAS, but nothing formal exists

Performance Workshops
   * Content still being revised - split into multiple workshops
      * Developers workshop
         * how to write pS clients
         * how to publish diagnostics to pS
      * Administrators/Operators workshop
         * where to deploy (topology, firewalls, etc...)
         * what tests make sense to regularly run (how often, to where...)
      * Users workshop
         * Am I getting the performance I should?
         * How do I report problems effectively?
      * Researchers workshop
         * Researchers will discuss eventual format at January Jt Techs
         * Workshop will be at July Jt Techs.
   * *Some* of the new material was presented at the APAN conference (Feb)
   * Anticipate the first new workshop will be presented at Internet2 Jt Techs meeting in July at OSU.

Best Practices Guide (no change)
   * Only small updates needed from the one recommended for USAtlas ( [[http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/Tier2BCP]] )
   * Will likely do this in cooperation with the Internet2 PerfWG
   * Will work on an updated hardware recommendation
