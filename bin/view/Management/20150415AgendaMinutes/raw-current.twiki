---++ Campus Grids and User Support - Rob Gardner


---+++ Key initiatives

   * Working with ACI-Ref
      * Discussions at OSG Council led to subcommittee (D. Swanson, F. Weurtheim, M. Neubauer, R. Gardner) 
      * To scale user support, recognized best approach is to &quot;facilitate the facilitators&quot;
      * One meeting of the group so far; white paper being drafted.
      * Develop a framework for working with southern universities - e.g. introducing them to OSG Connect
     
   * Chicagoland OSG Workshop
      * Working with research computing directors at Northwestern and UChicago to sponsor a OSG workshop for Chicagoland universities
      * To be hosted at Northwestern in summer
      * Probable invites: UIC, IIT, NIU, Chicago State
      * Goals:
         * Working through campus research computing organizations, bring pre-screened research groups with HTC-capable workloads onto the OSG
         * Develop model for OSG Campus/User Support -- campus research computing facilitators to provide sustainable support to end users

   * Campus Connect client development
      * Goal is to give campus grids a client tool:
         * Pre-installed, configured, and supported by local campus cluster admin
         * Submission to OSG via grid universe
         * Submission to local scheduler via vanilla universe, using local campus allocation
         * Plus &quot;connect&quot; and &quot;tutorial&quot; commands
         * As a modules command: allow switching between local modules collection and OASIS modules
         * *Must be lightweight*, introduce no significant load on the campus cluster login host
      * See D. Champion&#39;s presentation at OSG AHM
      * Design document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPCW4K3vX2nTvgIPjS1iQxMEqZCfJmAylAViQuDTIyU/edit?usp=sharing
      * Beta testing now

   * Support for the OSG Summer School
      * Working with Tim to provide backend support and some content (e.g. !ConnectBook - based) to the school
      * Will review needs periodically at the bi-weekly meeting

   * Distributed Environment Modules update
      * All HTC-appropriate libraries from XSEDE yum repo now in OASIS
      * Continue to add modules on demand (109 libraries in total)
      * Currently (109 libraries in total): &lt;pre&gt;[rwg@login01 ~]$ module avail

      * Working on tutorial development for autodock-vina (http://vina.scripps.edu/) - an open source tool for molecular docking.
         * Groups:
            * Jacob Pessin, Einstein School of Medicine, goal: diabatics, Project: MS-EinDRC
            * Marta Wells (new user), University of Pittsburgh,  goal: anesthesiology, Project:PainDrugs
            * Li Chen, David Minh group, IIT, Project:AlGDock
         * Description: Autodock is a suite of programs that includes autodock and autodock-vina. It  serves the drug discovery community. Many groups in biochemistry and medicine utilize autodock to find out suitable drug molecule for specific diseases. Usually, thousands of molecules are screened against a target protein. The free energy or the binding energy is computed for docking a ligand and protein. Based on the computed binding energy, the ligands are screened.  Such a problem is a great fit for DHTC. In fact we have a few users already using autodock on OSG Connect. I believe we can attract more users from Drug Discovery community could benefit from the DHTC on OSG.
