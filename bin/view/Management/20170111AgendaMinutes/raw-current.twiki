Key Initiatives
   1. Busy schedule on planned OASIS updates for early 2017 (e.g. remove RHEL5 components; improved update latency). Deployed &quot;cold&quot; RHEL7.3 Stratum-1 at UNL with Squid 3 for IPv6 support.
   2. Singularity distribution aimed for OSG 3.4 / ~mid 2017. Planning to enable it in glideinWMS FE for the OSG VO. Porting those lessons to the CMS (largest gLExec user) to plan their migration
   3. GRACC deployment expected now in Feb. 5 remaining work items are closely tracked.
   4. Progress on SRM retirement from CMS and ATLAS sites. Tentative timeline: OSG AHM to have most transitions completed; dropping BeStMan in OSG 3.4 (mid 2017); drop support by end 2017.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. HDFS 3.0 upgrade planned for OSG 3.4 at risk to incur delays
   2. BDII deprecation and OASIS upgrade requires full focus
   3. LVS / GridFTP documentation is at risk of being too late to be useful.

Key Accomplishments
   1. StashCache in production use at O(100 TB) with ~ 5 large users. CVMFS synchronization reliable. Deployed prototype at Syracuse for authenticated access used by LIGO
