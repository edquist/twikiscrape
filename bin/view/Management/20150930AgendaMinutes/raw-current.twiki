---++ Minutes
Key Initiatives
   1. Improve infrastructure: may need one more submission node to support growth of concurrent jobs beyond 10k.
   2. Focusing on user support function - solving 1 issue per day in average; supporting on-line support chat (mainly new users)
   3. Continue to develop tutorials e.g. Matlab runtime, Pegasus-Blast, Gromacs (molecular dynamics); writing forum articles (retrying failed jobs, multicore and GPU jobs); OSG-Duke Workshop on 10/27 - good registration rate (30 registered out of 40 per session)
   4. Development activities - Freesurfer project: build submission service for computational neuroscientists to process MRI image data. Connect Client: bug fixes, improved monitoring, and site testing.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Continuous improvement of processes and technology to enable the expansion of the user base

Key Accomplishments
   1. Since Jul 1: 110 new users joined OSG Connect, 150 users submitted 1 job or more, 40 users submitted 10 jobs or more , 19 active projects from 15 universities, total concurrent jobs often at 10k 

Goals will be discussed in detail at the next meeting on Campus Grids
