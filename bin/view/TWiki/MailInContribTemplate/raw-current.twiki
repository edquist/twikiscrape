---+ Templates for the MailInContrib

*DO NOT MODIFY THIS TOPIC*

This is a normal TWiki topic, but it is also a template file, as described in %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiTemplates. It contains the template definitions used by the MailInContrib to insert mail messages in topics.

Each template is specified in the form of a pair of TWiki template definitions, (surrounded by verbatim tags below for readability). The template to use when inserting incoming mail in a topic is decided from the parameters in the =&amp;lt;--MAIL--&gt; comment in the topic. The default template is =normal=.

&lt;verbatim&gt;
%TMPL:DEF{MAILIN:normal}%   * *%SUBJECT%*: %TEXT% -- %WIKIUSERNAME% - %SERVERTIME%%ATTACHMENTS%
%TMPL:END%
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

=%&lt;nop&gt;ATTACHMENTS%= in the previous template will be expanded to a list of attachments that came in the mail. Each attachment in the list is formatted by the following template:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
%TMPL:DEF{MAILIN:normal:ATTACHMENT}%      * %A_FILE%
%TMPL:END%
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

*DO NOT MODIFY THIS TOPIC*

If you want to modify or add any templates, create the TWiki topic %TWIKIWEB%.MailInContribUserTemplate. This topic is automatically included here if it exists, but it is *not* shipped with the MailInContrib. Any templates you define in %TWIKIWEB%.MailInContribUserTemplate will override those defined here.

&lt;!-- The following line includes a *template* called &quot;MailInUserContrib&quot;, which the template search rules automatically resolve to a *topic* called MailInContribUserTemplate. --&gt;
%TMPL:INCLUDE{&quot;MailInContribUser&quot;}%
