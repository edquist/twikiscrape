---+ Package =TWiki::Form=

Object representing a single form definition.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* &lt;tt&gt;($session,$web,$form)&lt;/tt&gt;

   * $web - default web to recover form from, if $form doesn&#39;t specify a web
   * =$form= - topic name to read form definition from

May throw TWiki::OopsException



---++ ObjectMethod *renderForEdit* &lt;tt&gt;($web,$topic,$meta) -&gt; $html&lt;/tt&gt;
   * =$web= the web of the topic being rendered
   * =$topic= the topic being rendered
   * =$meta= the meta data for the form

Render the form fields for entry during an edit session, using data values
from $meta



---++ ObjectMethod *renderFieldForEdit* &lt;tt&gt;($fieldDef,$web,$topic,$value) -&gt; $html&lt;/tt&gt;
   * =$fieldDef= the field being rendered
   * =$web= the web of the topic being rendered
   * =$topic= the topic being rendered
   * =$value= the current value of the field

Render a single form field for entry during an edit session, using data values
from $meta. Plugins can provide a handler that extends the set of supported
types

SMELL: this should be a method on a field class
SMELL: JSCalendarContrib ought to provide a &#39;date&#39; handler.



---++ ObjectMethod *renderHidden* &lt;tt&gt;($meta) -&gt; $html&lt;/tt&gt;
Render form fields found in the meta as hidden inputs, so they pass
through edits untouched.



---++ ObjectMethod *cgiName* &lt;tt&gt;($field) -&gt; $string&lt;/tt&gt;
Generate the &#39;name&#39; of the CGI parameter used to represent a field.



---++ ObjectMethod *getFieldValuesFromQuery* &lt;tt&gt;($query,$metaObject) -&gt; ($seen,\@missing)&lt;/tt&gt;
Extract new values for form fields from a query.
   * =$query= - the query
   * =$metaObject= - the meta object that is storing the form values

For each field, if there is a value in the query, use it.
Otherwise if there is already entry for the field in the meta, keep it.

Returns the number of fields which had values provided by the query, and a references to an array of the names of mandatory fields that were missing from the query.



---++ ObjectMethod *isTextMergeable* &lt;tt&gt;($name) -&gt; $boolean&lt;/tt&gt;
   * =$name= - name of a form field (value of the =name= attribute)
Returns true if the type of the named field allows it to be text-merged.

If the form does not define the field, it is assumed to be mergeable.



---++ ObjectMethod *getField* &lt;tt&gt;($name) -&gt; \%row&lt;/tt&gt;
   * =$name= - name of a form field (value of the =name= attribute)
Returns the field, or undef if the form does not define the field.



---++ ObjectMethod *getFields* &lt;tt&gt;() -&gt; \@fields&lt;/tt&gt;
Return a list containing references to field name/value pairs.
Each entry in the list has a {name} field and a {value} field. It may
have other fields as well, which caller should ignore. The
returned list should be treated as *read only* (must not be written to).



---++ StaticMethod *renderForDisplay* &lt;tt&gt;($templates,$meta)&lt;/tt&gt;
   * =$templates= ref to templates singleton
   * =$meta= - meta object containing the form to be rendered
Static because we want to be able to do this without a form definition.

SMELL: Why? Is reading the form topic such a big burden?
