---+ Package =TWiki::Search=

This module implements all the search functionality.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* &lt;tt&gt;($session)&lt;/tt&gt;

Constructor for the singleton Search engine object.



---++ StaticMethod *getTextPattern* &lt;tt&gt;($text,$pattern)&lt;/tt&gt;

Sanitise search pattern - currently used for FormattedSearch only



---++ ObjectMethod *searchWeb* &lt;tt&gt;(...)&lt;/tt&gt;

Search one or more webs according to the parameters.

If =_callback= is set, that means the caller wants results as
soon as they are ready. =_callback_ should be set to a reference
to a function which takes =_cbdata= as the first parameter and
remaining parameters the same as &#39;print&#39;.

If =_callback= is set, the result is always undef. Otherwise the
result is a string containing the rendered search results.

If =inline= is set, then the results are *not* decorated with
the search template head and tail blocks.

SMELL: If =format= is set, =template= will be ignored.

SMELL: If =regex= is defined, it will force type=&#39;regex&#39;

SMELL: If =template= is defined =bookview= will not work

SMELL: it seems that if you define =_callback= or =inline= then you are
	responsible for converting the TML to HTML yourself!
	
FIXME: =callback= cannot work with format parameter (consider format=&#39;| $topic |&#39;
