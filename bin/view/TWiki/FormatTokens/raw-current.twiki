---++ Formatting Tokens

TWiki defines some standard special tokens that can be used to replace characters in some parameters - notably those to FormattedSearch and IfStatements - to defer evaluation of the parameter until later. These special tokens are often called &quot;escapes&quot;, because they allow the character to &quot;escape&quot; from its normal meaning. 
%STARTINCLUDE%| =$n= or =$n()= | New line. Use =$n()= if followed by alphanumeric character, e.g. write =Foo$n()Bar= instead of =Foo$nBar= |
| =$nop= or =$nop()= | Is a &quot;no operation&quot;. This variable gets removed; useful for nested search |
| =$quot= | Double quote (=&quot;=) (\&quot; also works) |
| =$percnt= | Percent sign (=%=) |
| =$dollar= | Dollar sign (=$=) |
%STOPINCLUDE%
If you ever find yourself needing to escape an escape, you can use =$dollar= to escape the leading dollar, thus: =$dollarpercnt=.
