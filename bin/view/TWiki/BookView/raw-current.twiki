*BookView* is an option available from the [[WebSearchAdvanced][advanced search]] topic. It allows you to display the result in &quot;book view&quot;, that is, the whole content of topics is shown instead of a topic summary. This allows you to easily see a whole set of pages, which is useful for printing.
