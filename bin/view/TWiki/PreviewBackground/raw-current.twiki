---+ Background Image for Preview

Preview looks like the real page, but the links lead to an oops dialog warning users of not-yet-saved topics. In addition, a background with a &quot;PREVIEW&quot; watermark is shown to have visual clue that you are previewing a topic. You can change the background image by specifying the name of an attached background image file in the PREVIEWBGIMAGE variable in the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC%.

Remarks:

   * You also could attach a new image file to this topic.
   * You can override the PREVIEWBGIMAGE preference variable in your personal home page.
