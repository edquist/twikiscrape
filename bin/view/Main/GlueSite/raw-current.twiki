---++Comments/Question

   * Is GlueSite being interpreted as more or less equivalent to the &quot;Site name&quot; that we see everywhere? It seems to me that the Site name is more like the name of a CE. For example, at Purdue, our research computing group runs 2 resources on OSG currently (a 3rd will be available soon). I read the schema description as our GlueSiteName being &quot;Purdue RCAC&quot; or some such, and then the clusters &quot;Lear&quot; and our Condor Pool being the two clusters associated with that site, rather than there being a GlueSite for each resource.
