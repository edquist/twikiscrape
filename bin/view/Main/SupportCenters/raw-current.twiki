---++Support Centers

Support Centers are part of the OSG distributed Operations Organization. They support a defined set of Virtual Organizations - ie Users -  and resources.

When a User encounters a problem or has a question they should contact their VO Support Center or fall back to the Grid Operations Center.

Problem reports or problems identified by the Grid Operations Center are  assigned to the appropriate Support Center for resolution.
