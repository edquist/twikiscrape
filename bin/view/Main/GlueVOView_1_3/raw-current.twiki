---++GlueVOView Attributes

!GlueVOView attributes specify policies and information for each VO.

dn: !GlueVOViewLocalID=$voname,!GlueCEUniqueID=CE_FQDN:2119/jobmanager-batch-queue,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid 

*NOTES*:
   1. Currently port number is hard-coded. May need to change.
   1. Dynamic scripts that update VOView information include:
      * osg-info-dynamic-pbs
      * osg-info-dynamic-condor
      * osg-info-dynamic-sge
      * osg-info-dynamic-lsf
   1. Since GIP runs as daemon user it is not able to get user/vo information from PBS, but it is  able to get queue level information.
