---+ Job Success Rates
See http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting for more information

Summary of the job exit status (midnight to midnight central time) for 2007-05-06
including all jobs that finished in that time period.

For Condor the value used is taken from &#39;ExitCode&#39; and NOT from &#39;Exit Status&#39;

__Philippe&#39;s current queries:__

These reports are currently generated by a cron job on gratia06 (still on myi
account) with use the library gratia/summary/PSACCTReport.py

The queries are:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
 SELECT CETable.facility_name, J.Status,count(*)  
 from gratia.CETable,
      gratia.CEProbes, 
      gratia.JobUsageRecord J  
where CEProbes.facility_id = CETable.facility_id 
  and J.ProbeName = CEProbes.probename 
  and &quot;2007-05-07 07:00:00&quot;&lt;&quot;2007-05-08 07:00:00&quot; 
  and J.StatusDescription != &quot;Condor Exit Status&quot;
group by CETable.facility_name,
         J.Status  
order by CETable.facility_name 

and

 SELECT CETable.facility_name, R.Value,count(*)  
 from gratia.CETable, 
      gratia.CEProbes, 
      gratia.JobUsageRecord J, 
      gratia.Resource R  
 where CEProbes.facility_id = CETable.facility_id 
 and J.ProbeName = CEProbes.probename 
 and &quot;2007-05-07 07:00:00&quot;&lt;&quot;2007-05-08 07:00:00&quot; 
 and J.dbid = R.dbid 
 and R.Description = &quot;ExitCode&quot;  
 group by CETable.facility_name,R.Value  
order by CETable.facility_name
&lt;/pre&gt;

which gives the number of jobs per exit code.  The python code post process 
the data to sum the number of jobs on both queries and in 2 categories 
(0 and non zero).



---+ PANDA Users - 5/8/07

I had a discussion with Jim Shank about the ATLAS/US ATLAS usage as recorded in Gratia 
and that recorded by PANDA.

I am interested in a .csv file from which I can make a chart of total PANDA CPUhours  
per week for the last 6 months and a chart of US ATLAS OSG CPUHours/week over the last six months.

Then we will of course want the same thing by site.

Of course -- when I get a Gratia plot of total CPU usage over the past six months I don&#39;t get 
the panda information included -- we need this as a button on the gratia page. 

And on this report we are getting non OSG sites again -- that is CERN etc. 

We are going to have to have a site white list/black list and a VO white list/black list for 
the Gratia OSG web reports...



---+Monthly CPU Usage - 5/8/07

   *  Monthly email with the CPUUsage by site of OSG VO Users by DN.
   * Monthly email of the number of times each DN has done a voms-proxy-init (maybe Keith can give that)
   * All users must use voms-proxy-init not grid-proxy-init. Presumed it can do that on the Fermilab site? 



---+Daily error codes by VO/Site - 05/14/07

   * An &quot;error codes&quot; daily report the list of non-success return codes by each VO and Site.
