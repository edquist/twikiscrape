About VO Administrators

The term &quot;VO Administrator&quot; potentially covers 2 separate roles:

   * manager of the registration of users and their associated roles in the VOMS database.
   * administrator of the VOMS Server

As VO administrators of the first kind, you will need to register the VO with OSG and provide information on the various VO specific processes.

As VO administrators of the second kind, you will need to setup the various VO specific services.

The mailing list vo-admins* This email address is being protected from spam bots, you need Javascript enabled to view it is available for coordination across VO Administrators and as a peer support group.
Register your VO with OSG

To form a Virtual Organization (VO) that participates in the Open Science Grid one needs the following:

   1. a Charter statement describing the purpose of the VO. This should be short yet concise enough to scope intended usage of OSG resources.
   2. at least one VO participating Organization that is a member or partner with the Open Science Grid Consortium.
   3. a VO Membership Service which meets the requirements of an OSG Release. This means being able to provide a full list of members&#39; DNs to edg-mkgridmap. The currently recommended way to do this is to deploy the VDT VOMS from the OSG software package.
   4. a support organization (called a Support Center in OSG parlance) that will support the VO in OSG Operations. The Support Center should provide at least the following:
          * a written description of the registration process,
          * instructions for the members of the VO on how to complete the VO registration process,
          * instructions for the members of the VO on how to report problems and/or obtain help.
   5. completion of the [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][registration form]] located here using [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/RegistrationInstructions][these instructions]]

About VOMS

All OSG VOs are required to have a VOMS (Virtual Organization Membership Service) for their VO and will need a VO administrator to manage their service. VOMS is the only *required* VO specific service for OSG.
