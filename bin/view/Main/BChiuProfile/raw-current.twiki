The human really knows very little compared to the scale of the intelligence behind the universe(s). Why don&#39;t we open our minds to other areas that are not yet aligned with mainstream science? (more...)

---+++ Computer Science %BR%

I would like to help clarify a common misconception that people generally have toward Computer Science. First of all, software 
development and programming are NOT Computer Science. Programming is merely a tool for verifying and &quot;materializing&quot; 
ideas in CS, which is analogical to the role of Applied Mathematics in Physics... Computer Science is philosophy manifested in     
computational forms... (more to come)
