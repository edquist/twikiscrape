Note that there is a new step for this dCache version; the line &quot;add_missing_from = on&quot; must be added to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf for the most recent version of postgres.

Shut down another application (MLrepository) that bundled it&#39;s own postgres server.
/home/tdh/MLrepository/stop.sh
