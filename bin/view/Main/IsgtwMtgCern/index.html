doubled readership
sleazy outfit
what is our relation with grid today
point to industrial , they use us for scien content
we link only to their orig content
dispersed group of people
<p />
open disc with grid today - how to work with each other, not step on toes, etc.
<p />
egeee-- tech deve for science gets to industry
<p />
don't want to do plugs
<p />
mandate for isgtw -- summ of chic meeting -- to be written
<p />
what's a biline? Idea to add feedback to author/cc to editor
<p />
web stats:
3800 hits so far
<p />
get more publicity, make it more interesting
<p />
<h2 class="twikinetRoundedAttachments"><span class="twikinetHeader"><a name="weekly_editorial_sched"></a> weekly editorial sched </span></h2>
<p />
xeno does layout now, in future editor will do
deadline, content a week ahead
ediotr layouts thurs, preview sent to adv board on Fri JJ, PA, HH,
Paul forwards to nsf and doe
feedback to ky by end of day monday
24 hours  to get ti out, tues, editor can make edits, send out wed am cern time
balance politics 
contact nsf , doe (give warning) by phone
have a paolicy
read everything with this in mind: who's going to be reading, who will feel slighted
feedback from doe/nsf comes from paul a
<p />
get feedback only from people you've met, they must feel comfortable with you
<p />
hasn't had to run a correction -- would have to be a grave effor
<p />
egee doesn't send it on to nsf-equiv, would be the EC, EC are subscribed to it
maybe check in couple times a year, very hands off
<p />
Advisory board
What is role?  Francois and Ruth involved but not on adv board
<p />
editorial board -- ky, owen, some osg person, two others
<p />
preview not sent to contributing editors
<p />
ruth's prob
<p />
us and europe
<p />
egee partner with many proj
<p />
osg by itself, and then other grid proj
<p />
more eur news, each country has projects
osg has less news, 
main editor to spend more time writing about other us projects
<p />
push in us to affiliate small grids to teragrid
europe ahead in cluster grids, behind in supercomp grids
150M for 5 yrs to teragrid, have approached 
<p />
funding 35M/y for manpower in eur for grid
<p />
more smaller proj in euro, 
<p />
jj: the initial complaint, more communication coming from eur, looks like all activity in eur
the resources aren't there in us, finally nsf funded katie's position, brought out sgtw + more
ky changed that balance, now is balance going to change again to eur?
eur pay more for comm than u.s.
don't want to slip back
wonder if can get more funding from nsf to right the balance
<p />
bring in kurt splee? from nsf, is major commm for nsf, involved with lhc comm. 
most u.s. projects that ky covers are nsf, not doe
need generous travel budget
<p />
fg: keep statistics to check balance
try to docu how much activity there really is, collect info about all grid projects, owen started, spent 2 mos, requires 3 mos
intensive to follow up
<p />
grid today wants db of grid projects
we could work with them, then we'd know how to check rumors, maybe not really useful
<p />
RUth and Bob Jones join
<p />
Discuss balance between US and Eur 
<p />
grid funding for comm much more in EU than in US
work hard to make sure US stories get told
rp thinks good idea to talk to Kurt
<p />

<p />
Plans over next 6 months
KY moves to CERN press office
JJ we will fund fulltime editor for i
paid 6 mo by FNAL as term employee, living at CERN, t
<p />
after that, establish CERN fellwosip funded by egee to get longterm, then make support come out even
goal -- all contribute to make it work
danielle will give 6 mon at least, then clearer idea how to move forward
<p />
fg:opening call for pos filled by apr 1 for fellow, 1 yr before end of egee proj. Danile may be candidate for that position.
2 scen -- it's Danielle, or other person and overlap with Danielle
<p />
egee2, egee3 in future
<p />
ruth: kevin says purch order throuh cern went smoothly, bob says don't use consultants here. complicated and tax rules
<p />
longterm plan for xeno, and who to pay
just hired to setup site and newsletter, not continuing contract, haven't discussed keeping them on
fnal has big contract with them, bundled sgtw in with others. may continue to do that (low-level), call in a pinch, xeno very
reliable, isgtw is fancier than html, need backup.
<p />
editors from osg, egee as backup for isgtw,
e.u is good at listing how much money was funded
xeno still doing layout, funding may just be fnal or euro too. then question about geneva company, so funding may be challenging, so easier if fnal funds that
<p />
danielle stepped out: about making her official offer, 
<p />
bob jones: how to bring in asia, how to find appropriate asian partner
kek has communications person for HEP
simon lin in taipei
do issue press releases, event in may, wehre  osg, egee will be involved, talk with simon then, Stella works with him
Heavily involved in LHC
Simon's here this week, FG saw him, try to meet with him.
benefits and resp of being contributing editor
asia isn't unified, another proj in japan, 
sou korea, slow responses
india?  eu-india project, know peopl with chep, english language
<p />
gridpp in uk (funded intern helen)
<p />
contrib editor
who to invite, defined comm, one pt of contact
incentive to contribute besides putting logo on
asking one contrib per mo
promotes their region, gets their message out, crossing atlantic is incentive
eu-funded proj, have obligation to do outreach, can encourage to isgtw
<p />
use promotion scheme where performant editors get some benefits
how to deal with nonperformant contributors, differnt 
get interns who has no other obligations who writes stories that we publish, suggest
<p />
ky proposes reg meeting with osg, egee, uk grid-pp, teragrid (editorial board)
<p />
function of adv board
review function when review comes out
<p />
bobj: 1st few issues, look good, adv board: periodic review
strategic dir, funding, contributions, conflicts
try for late march before candidate is chosen
<p />
rp is exec dir of osg which is funding position, doesn't want to be in adv board, wants to continue to get previews, still wants paul to ...
ex-officio -- member by virtue of your position representing stakeholder
fg: lcg news --> grid news, then he becomes contrib editor for lcg (he'll check with lcg, else sim to ruth)
ruth happy to be ex-officio member representing osg exec.
<p />
expand preview to other contrib editors?  owen: yes, may give better sense of buy-in
<p />
rp: input for next few issues, thre will be minutes.  
rp and bob j leave; it's noon now.
<p />
AFternoon
<p />
Owen cern blogwatcher
search engine for blogs, ky has blog will go into Symmetry
<p />
KY For next Wed
ISD Helsinki (eq of SC), meeting report
naregi (japan) for next next week
purdue/ucsd data xfer CMS tier2
intel quadcore launch
old sgtw, reprint and link, so cal ncsa (teragrid-rel article), ky: not to reprint, but 1st par and link
<p />
owen: ask if we can reprint, better to not take people off the site too often
ky: never link to product launches
<p />
idea about writing guidelines -- katie will compile
<p />
news-in-brief
suggest it's a selection, not compendium
there's in the news, written by actual journalists
keep press releases still in "in the news"
isgtw doesn't cover big stories that everyone else covers, could put in news0nbrief
<p />
ky moves to lcg 1st of year, leaves isgtw
<p />
owen: EGI duro grid initiative, to move 2 yr funding to 5-7 yr cycle, profile on serbian guy (2 articles)
then one on related proj. 
<p />
Story idea JJ: owen's survey of grids that exist 
fg: Tom Taber, how fashionable are science grids
can do opinion pieces -- leveraging good contacts, elicits responses from readers and can publish those
name some:
Mark Linash, OGF, bridges industrial/academic divide
Tim Berners-Lee  web science group (not grid)
ian foster  wrote for globus tenth anniv, spinning off the grid, can academic grids be spun , univa is company name
indian guy in melbourne business models for grid :rajqumar
miron livny (if ask ian, must ask miron)
Steve Ticky
Tony Hay MS with grid
some serious lhc physicist; lothar? no, 
swiss tropics? fg 
miles allen -- climate prediction, and involved in how much car companies are responsible for this,
boink -- evenison (contrary piece) why "ceti at home" it's not a grid (lots of scien read boink)
vincent breton, jannick: healthgrid, assoc of orgs interested in grid for health
martin hoffman bio scientist in berlin (fg)?
jugfreund (siemens) pediatric med data, elec patient records, federating patient data
DESA -- teragrid in europe (applications)
finland's sc center direc  kimmo koski, supports more science than egee
<p />
(profiles or opinion pieces)
<p />
profiles didn't get read, opinion pieces may be more popular
need to brainstorm on the monthly meetings of editorial board
<p />
ky: talked to kevin about collaborative area in web site
editorial calendar  -- list of people, projects, articles coming up
<p />
ask kevin about wiki-- one area for editor contirubotors to put in idaes, editor gets to use the "real" area
first meeting in january
<p />
<h2 class="twikinetRoundedAttachments"><span class="twikinetHeader"><a name="partnerships_with_other_projects"></a> partnerships with other projects </span></h2>
<p />
<h2 class="twikinetRoundedAttachments"><span class="twikinetHeader"><a name="publicity"></a> publicity </span></h2>
Pump up the circulation?
Kevin's website statistics, doesn't know why low stats
Exhausted usual HEP sources
JJ: where do we want audience to come from. who's the target?
grid community and potential grid commm. 
how to get back grid community?
don't have unsubscribes, but they aren't clicking on articles
can get to hep collaborations, how to get to other sciences
chat with webmasters
<p />
can put little token that webmasters can take it and add to their page
print publiscations, stick on table at conferences, business cards, bookmarks, whatever,
turn the "do you speak grid" into this
ask egee and osg for funds
<p />
I'm the web, I'm the grid" spoof, on u-tube 
Give the publication its own voice, so far isgtw is "businesslike", maybe time to think outside this box, develop a
personal relationship with readers. So far, puts other stuff in.. not it's own.
<p />
Run podcast "what is the grid"
cartoons, "pick the caption"
Have a blog for the editor -- travels with my laptop, various things
feedback area
lots of ideas!!
<p />
<h2 class="twikinetRoundedAttachments"><span class="twikinetHeader"><a name="Financial_contributions_from_oth"></a> Financial contributions from other parties </span></h2>
content more important than cash -- have other grids sponsor interns to write
more than just their grid, but regional
teragrid, grid-pp
can give them presence in adv board and whatever.
direct funding from eu
<p />
other sites:
ruth wants to rotate grid cafe and gridtoday with other things, what things are there?  not much
give up their logos, just put them in when have content,
need more sources, or 
other newletters to mine, Globus journal with special banner, 
Gridcafe is Francois and Rosie
<p />
<h2 class="twikinetRoundedAttachments"><span class="twikinetHeader"><a name="with_Kevin_Munday"></a> with Kevin Munday </span></h2>
gridtoday hasn't linked to us yet, if they don't, just list them as in the news
ian foster put a link in his blog, he sends article ideas.
<p />
thechnology news daily post press releases -- not that interesting
<p />
General status:
in rush to roll out, now de-gerrymandering into useful workflow
can now be produced automatically by content mgm system
customizion take back seat to retrofit, but will come
doc for understanding the system, how content xfered, how pages relate to each other
can now turn it over to let somebody do edits
Get through production of an issue with Danielle, then can give it a try in January week of Dec 17th.  Anne to go with, Owen to learn from Danielle in Jan when she comes to CERN.
<p />
Stats:
kevin thinks nothing is wrong, just it has to grow
do we want to port materials over and leave urls intact but use redirects
pages exist on interactions server
if port to isgtw server while maintaining redirects, can maintain google standing (run script to do this)
sgtw was subset of interactions.
Nov, 6k visits to sgtw subdir (not isgtw) for Nov, oct 7438, sept 5453
any redirects will be counted twice
<p />
2ndary priorities -- customizations for searching, attaching docs and high res images
Collaboration page: want a wiki
Kevin: just had security issue, would use a fresh instance for us, but would require same vigilance as the other instances he's got going.
Kevin can do quickly, just give him requirements. Ky to provide.  dokuwiki
<p />
bilines and give mailto links -- kevin to look into
<p />
tagging: kevin to do some more work
