      * The UCSD Factory was up and running again by Friday 9/9 10:30 am (PT)
      * Effects of outage on UCSD Factory
         * Only negative effect is new glideins cannot be submitted
         * Glideins already running on grid are not effected
         * User jobs running on grid are not effected and should complete normally
         * Glideins already running can continue to accept new user jobs until they reach their retire time
      * Attached below are plots of monitoring during outage from UCSD factory and glow frontend
         * note the frontend monitoring depends on the factory being up to accurately report, during the outage the number of jobs running did *not* go to zero.

   * ITB Factory machine has high load due to insufficient CPU
