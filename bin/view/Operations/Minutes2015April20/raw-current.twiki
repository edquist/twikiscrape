   * Oracle released updates for Java and !MySQL. No details on vulnerabilities, but sounds like only server side issues are a possibility of a denial of service. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2015-2365600.html
   * Work continuing on new CILogon CA cert testing. OIM functional testing complete. Repackaging CA certs as standalone rpm for testing instead of as part of existing cilogon-certs rpm.
   * Security drill for osg-connect coming up, focusing on traceability.
