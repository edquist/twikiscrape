iVDGL VO removed from the VO list on the ESNet page for requesting certificates. VDT cert-scripts pull data from the GOC, so those should be updated as well.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

   * OIM Rollout (http://oim.grid.iu.edu)
      * All contacts in the (old) registration database have received emails requesting they activate their OIM accounts. Users must respond within 48 hours or they will need to contact the GOC and request a new activation be sent. If you have not received one of these emails and you believe you should have because you are a current contact for a Support Center, VO, or Resource, please contact the GOC.
   * OSG 1.0.0 Release Delay
      * Delayed due to some security fixes. Hopefully the package can be released next week. 
   * Update to VO Package with CDF changes coming on Wednesday
      * GUMS template and VOMS file updates for the CDF so they can use their three different VOMS&#39;.
   * !RSV v2 package will be released today
      * SRM probes will be part of this release; CMS and ATLAS admins, please install them asap so we can report SE probe results to the !WLCG.
