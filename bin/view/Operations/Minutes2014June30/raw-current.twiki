Nothing significant.

   * Network Problems to login01
      * Lasted from Thursday night to Friday evening. 
      * We believe this problem has been resolved.  A border IP block was mistakenly put in place external to the OSG operational sphere, but which affected OSG Connect nonetheless.  This block has been removed, and we anticipate normal behavior from now forward.
