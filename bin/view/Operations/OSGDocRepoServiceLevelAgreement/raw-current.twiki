OSG Document Repository (!DocDB)

---+++ !!Description

OSG !DocDB is a document repository used for public documentation related to work in the OSG, including blueprint documents, presentations given at a conference or collaboration meeting or papers published in a journal, among others. 

---++ Security Considerations

Accessibility to documents in the repository is at the document version level.  Some documents are viewable to the public, others are not.  Write access is based on a user&#39;s membership in !DocDB security groups. Each !DocDB user must use either their IGTF, !DOEGrids, or Fermilab KCA certificate in order to access private content or to create or update documents. Based on their role within the organization, they are given membership to the applicable groups. All group membership requires approval by an OSG Council member or by a member of OSG management. 

---++ Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times

This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see [[#Requests_for_Service_Enhancement][Requests for Service Enhancement]] for information on planned maintenance outages.
