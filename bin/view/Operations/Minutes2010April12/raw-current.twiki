---++ Operations This Week
   * *Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * *GGUS*
         * *Revisiting*: USCMS had question about origin of alarm tickets from training/ITB systems; We had contacted GGUS admins about this...
            * GGUS developers test alarm mechanism to US-T1 sites after each production release (usually last Wednesday of each month); changes in release date, if any, are announced in advance.
            * GGUS developers may occasionally create alarm tickets on GGUS-Train but these tickets do *not* send a text message to the relevant party; however these tickets will create corresponding GOC-Ticket-ITB tickets, and consequently corresponding support center tickets (for example: on BNL&#39;s production RT system)
            * GOC requested that GGUS clearly demarcate test alarms from their training/ITB system - they will try but can&#39;t promise.
      * *BNL RT*
         * Recommended to USATLAS management that this us ready for real production tickets; OSG management has already approved; waiting on response from John Hover/Michael Ernst.
         * [[http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AQGl_1gJKDWDZGY5ZnR6anZfMjFmMmpzZmc1cA&amp;hl=en#Transition_from_email_based_ex_7272405605382354][GOC-TX  section with detailed transition proposal]]
      * *FNAL Remedy*
         * Further connections issues and problem with web service interface reported to Remedy developers; Not high priority at FNAL
         * No progress to report
      * *VDT*, *PROD_SLAC*, *UC_CI*, *SBGrid*
         * GOC has promised simple instructions on how to setup RT to use GOC-TX; depending on ease and priority, these SCs may adopt use of GOC-TX
      * We urge everyone to move to using using GOC-TX -- contact GOC if you do ticket exchange with us! (We have initiated contact with our ticket exchange collaborators about this)
         * NERSC will likely continue to use email based exchange; GOC may add additional module to GOC-TX if feasible to enhance email based exchange for any SC that is not able to participate in web-services based exchange

   * *Top Level WLCG BDII Monitoring*
      * GOC is working out details with CMS; Monitor top level WLCG BDIIs (list of IPs RR&#39;ed by DNS) for presence of recent data for all WLCG-Interop-BDII enabled OSG resources
      * Action items upon finding a problem still not clear - being worked out with CMS and OSG management
