---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesOctober30][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  Vanderbilt is running jobs again; the site was down. Overall things are improving. Buffalo (GRASE) is trying to figure out why jobs aren&#39;t running there, but they&#39;re looking into it.

   * *This week*:   Not present at the meeting.

2) A reminder regarding Super Computing planning
   *  Rob is putting together a [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/meetings/sc06.php][schedule]] of presentations.

3) New VORS is in development at http://vors-dev2.grid.iu.edu  
   * Send comments or bugs to the GOC.
   * We will go production with the ITB first, which should happen soon.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG usage spotlight on LIGO _Murali Ramsunder_

2) GADU&#39;s large job run
   * &quot;There are three tools to be run, each tool is divided into approximately 40K jobs each running for about ~ 2 1/2 hours. I am expecting this run to take atleast a month, if not more. My target is to maintain more than 1000 running jobs as consistently as possible. Along with OSG, I will also be using Teragrid sites in this run.&quot; -Dinanath
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/gaduvo/gadu_jobs.cgi -- number of jobs running or jobs in queue at each site used
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/sulakhe/cgi-bin/site_selection_new.pl -- total number of sites from OSG and Teragrid that GADU has access to and their status for tests
      * The GOC will request GADU&#39;s presence at the next Operations Meeting to discuss the progress.

---++ OSG RA Items

No items.

---++ Pending Registrations

   * VO *Engage* and its SC: *Engagement* -- _Approved_
      * EB has given approval for both.
      * Purpose: Facilitate bringing new users onto the OSG. Main load is physics. The VO is up and running. 4-8 weeks there should hopefully be a at least one group ready to submit jobs. GOC will get a new VO package out this week so that sites may pick that up if they wish to enable this new VO at their site(s).

   * Resources : *Geneseo* _Approved_
      * Production CE. Supported by GRASE.
      * Structural biology. Part of the NY state grid.
      * A couple of days may be needed before the site is up.

---++ [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/tickets][Tickets]]

   * 2577 - Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID
       * Keith Chadwick and Jaime had conversations outside of the ticket. Fermilab believed the issue to be ongoing, but VDT Support Center believes the problem is with SAZ on the Fermilab end. Alain will followup and be sure Fermilab is copied on future updates.


---++ Other issues

Super Computing next week. If attendance will be low we may cancel next week&#39;s meeting.
