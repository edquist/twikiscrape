   * Short outage in Ticket exchange between GOC and !ServiceNow. Patched and currently working.
   * ITB release, largely internal updates. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/goc-service-update-tuesday-february-28.html][Release note]]

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * Investigated outage between GOC-TX and !ServiceNow.  Both S. Timm and A. Tiradani are now on !ServiceNow integration list which means we will get a heads-up from further WSDL changes.  Support model still under discussion with !ServiceNow maintainers to work with Axis and other Java-based services.
   * GOC ticket 11711, a spam ticket about hair extensions, was opened via ticket.grid.iu.edu and forwarded to !ServiceNow on Sat. 2/25.
   * Gratia operations investigation discovered a !MyOSG bug that wasn&#39;t sending email to contacts that didn&#39;t have DN&#39;s, will that be fixed in production release this week?
   * Gratia total VO count now stands at 87, down from a max of 564.  Much of it traced to misconfigured PBS and LSF sites.  Patches already made available for Gratia PBS in osg 1.2.27, in progress for LSF.
---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Condor failing with bug when calling glexec in europe; ATLAS pilots require glexec
      * Dan Bradley from condor team gave us a patched condor tarball to send out with glideins only for problem sites.
      * This only affects UCSD factory since ATLAS only submits from there for now while ramping up.
   * Hold limits have changed for gwms 2.5.4.  If any single VO reaches the limit it stops submission for all other VOs.  This is not expected behavior.
      * Should be fixed in gwms 2.5.6
      * Until then we have to manually remove glideins as they approach limits.
   * XSEDE pilots now accepted at Nebraska (was gums mapping error)
   * We are testing glideinWMS 2.5.5

---++ Operations This Week
   * Production release, notes above.
   * Domain switch and web page move are in progress. 
      * opensciencegrid.org DNS will be moving to IU.
      * Current webpages at www.opensciencegrid.org will point to the OSG TWiki. 

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * No planned changes this week.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * May upgrade ITB Factory only to glideinWMS 2.5.5 
   * Will begin testing condor 7.7.4
   * No plans to upgrade Production Factories this week
