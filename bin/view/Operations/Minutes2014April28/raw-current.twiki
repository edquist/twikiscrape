---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

We had a disk fail on the OSG gratia database machine.  It was a raid10 mirror and within a couple of hours of that disk failing the mirrored disk start getting errors reading sectors on the disk.  This caused database corruption and we lost the filesystem.

We provisioned a new SLF6 mysql 5.1 machine and restored the database to it.  There were a few issues initially getting this setup to work but we did get that up by Thursday.  It became clear that there were performance issues and we tried tuning a few variables related to memory heap sizes but by Friday evening the database was backed up again.

The database group here at Fermilab is working with Mysql consultants at the RDX consulting company to optimize the performance so queries don&#39;t pile up as they&#39;re doing now.  We&#39;re hoping these guys are expert enough that we&#39;ll get fast results.
