---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly10][previous meeting]]

Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing)

   * LIGO is hosting jobs now? You&#39;re breaking up the job that&#39;s expected to run 200 hours to completion into smaller parts.

      * Haven&#39;t run the jobs yet. The jobs have been broken down into smaller pieces. GRASE and Vanderbilt will be running the jobs, or at least they have agreed to run the jobs. They put a DAG out in front to manage it and they do get an authentication timeout which may be a problem in the future. Jobs are still running at UNM. Jobs at Purdue have finished. They are hoping to get jobs submitted and running this week.


---++ Hot Topics for the week

   1. OSG Twiki maintenance Wed July 19 4PM - Thu July 20 4PM
      * Twiki moving to new server. DNS propagation will need to occur.
   1. New !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA production on port 8080 at monalisa.grid.iu.edu and it should be up next Monday.
   1. New cert for the server that runs VORS. The new DN being used is CN=Leigh Grundhoefer (!GridScan) 274052, OU=People, DC=doegrids, DC=org

---++ OSG RA Items

Every VO will have at least one agent that is responsible for cert requests. There will be some agents who serve for multiple VO&#39;s, so not every VO will have its own agent.

   * Fermi/Remedy - 82036 - FNAL_FERMIGRID finished jobs over 14 million from MIPP? 
      * This was from Friday&#39;s report, http://grid02.uits.indiana.edu:8080/reports/daily/20060714/index.html - major problems with Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA at FNAL.
      *  S. Timm notes Fermilab believes this is due to continuing high load on a couple of their condor_schedd machines.  They are working to reduce load but this has not been done as yet.  Real number finished is closer to 14000 than 14000000.
---++ Other issues

   1. A new VDT release will be out this week with a new update to VOMS.
   1. Leigh also mentioned the security announcement that was made last week and sent by the GOC Friday. A mailing was sent to the security list and posted to the RSS feed.
   1. GIP using a lot of CPU time. (particularly in configuration at FNAL_GPFARM which has enabled the group quotas feature in condor, which requires a lot of extra condor_q, condor_config_val, and condor_status calls).
   1. Aron from UNM. Under ML look under global view and nanoHUB is not showing up. Leigh will look into this and followup.
