---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesNovember27][previous meeting]]

1) Deprecating grid-proxy, use voms-proxy
   * Started with the desire to execute apps on a server as the user of the app instead of root or apache. Fermilab and a group from the Netherlands worked on...have to use voms-proxy...no way to tell what VO a person should be in with grid-proxy w/o GUMS. So the suggestion is to move away from grid-proxy to voms-proxy. Dan sent email earlier today to osg-general and osg-et detailing the reasons why we should consider this change. See the email for more info. Eric has invited Dan to attend the Troubleshooting Meeting today following the Operations Meeting to allow for further discussion.
   * SAZ only accepts voms-proxies...it allows grid-proxies in the db, but it denies them automatically and to be added you have to be manually added by the SAZ admin. SAZ is not in the VDT, there has been no request to have it added.
   * If we use voms-proxy instead of grid-proxy, what would we break? Right now we&#39;re not sure.

2) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  nanoHUB is now running on Buffalo sites. Not running jobs on Vanderbilt, but they are red on Gridcat. GOC ran the failing Hello World test manually and it passed. Leigh had some questions about how to understand the maps on the nanoHUB stats page.


   * *This week*: Having authorization issues at UNM and Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt has problems with their new gatekeeper and since then nanoHUB has had problems there. I spoke with Jim Thomas at UNM today. Other sites are also having problems with authorization failures and they&#39;re going to look into those.


---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on NWICG
Notre Dame got their gatekeeper up. Purdue will bringing machines online soon. Scientists are just now lining up to use the OSG. They have a process defined and are now issuing certs. Rob asked who is answering the NWICG support email and Kevin should be, but he hasn&#39;t received the emails. Kevin will followup on the mail forwarding issue with that support account.

---++ OSG RA Items

      * Working on this.

   * 2753 - Condor-G jobs to Notre Dame NWICG fail with an authorization error
      * Kevin will look into why the support email isn&#39;t being received. Footprints, the GOC ticket system is using the correct address for NWICG.

---++++ USCMS
   * 2720 - Fermi/Remedy - 88386 - OSG user disabled due to fork bomb
      * Burt has had no resolution. The user was disabled a while ago. John Rosheck will followup w/user again.

---++++ VDT
   * 2784 - /etc/grid-security not setup after vdt install
      * Nothing to be done here.

---++++ USATLAS
   * 2417 - OU_OSCER_OSG three months downtime for maintenance
      * Extended to February 1.

---++++ OSG SC
   * 2785 - Request availability of SRM client v 1.25 (critical update request, CriticalUpdateSOPv2)
      * Steven Timm tested. Package installed okay. He will send the GOC a detailed update.

---++++ GRASE SC
   * 2735 - Host key verification failed in the WN on GRASE-CCR-U2 (u2-grid.ccr.buffalo.edu)
      * Waiting for update from GRASE Support Center _no representation_

---++++ CSC
   *  2736 - Host key verification failed in the WN on Purdue-Physics (grid.physics.purdue.edu)

---++ Other issues

Joint Operations Meeting dates confirmed, June 4-7 in Bloomington, Indiana. This does coincide with the TeraGrid Meeting.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

   * SAM testing and ticketing via GGUS seems to be starting (ticket 2709) Currently
     EGEE using interop bdii to run tests. Rob Quick is working with EGEE to test against
     one ITB node. So this work is ongoing.
