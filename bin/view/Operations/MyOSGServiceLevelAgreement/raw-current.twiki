---++ Executive Summary
This SLA is an agreement between OSG Operations at Indiana University and the OSG Management describing details of the !MyOSG presentation tools. The !MyOSG service runs on hardware at Indiana University and gathers data from several OSG sources including but not limited to: RSV, OIM, BDII, GIP-Validator, and Gratia. !MyOSG displays information from many different sources in many different formats. This SLA is inclusive only of selected service used to provide job level decisions or data movement, most notably the XML status based information. A complete list of services presented is in Appendix B.

---++ Owners
The !MyOSG SLA is owned by OSG Operations Center and  Indiana University and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team.

---++ Service Name and Description

GOC Production !MyOSG 
---+++ !!Description
The GOC Production !MyOSG service presents information from several OSG information sources and presents the information in various forms including web page, Universal Widget API, and XML. The !MyOSG service consists of a web server and software consolidators to translate incoming data from several sources to be displayed in !MyOSG.

---++ Security Considerations
!MyOSG distributes some private contact information based on certificate authentication. It will be subject to Indiana University institutional policy. Direct access to any of the hardware or software will be restricted to OSG Operations staff. Other OSG staff, upon request and GOC review, may be given access to a development version of !MyOSG for experimenting with new software, changes in information providers, or for other testing. OSG Operations reserves the right to allow or not allow such requests based on its internal review.
