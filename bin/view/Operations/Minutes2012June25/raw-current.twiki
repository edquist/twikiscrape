   * Internal LDAP server became unstable early AM Thu. 21/Jul, root cause too many open file descriptors caused by a large (x12) increase in processes on osg-xsede.grid.iu.edu. Simple configuration changes and an LDAP restart solved the problem. System has survived a larger process spike without problem. Some rsynch and backup delays were encountered, staff access was intermittent during the problem, no outward facing outages. Resolved ~10 AM 21/Jul.
