---+ Deployment Plan for Top Level WLCG BDII Service

---++ Preliminary Working Group Report

The preliminary workgroup produced a report located at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1021. 

---++ Request Documentation 

The request by the WLCG is recorded in tickets [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9893][9893]] and [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9892][9892]].

The presentation by the WLCG Information Officer to the WLCG Management Board is located at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LCG/WLCGISArea/BDII_Deployment_Plan.pdf.

---++ Introduction and Purpose

The WLCG Information System is used to discover services and get status information about WLCG resources. It is important to ensure high reliability of the WLCG Information System Service to support the LCH experiments. To insure this high availability the service must have a critical level SLA defining emergency and after hour procedures. To ensure this availability to a worldwide community the WLCG has deployed a plan to run 12 geographically dispersed services. The OSG has offered to run this service for BNL (USATLAS) and FNAL (USCMS). 

This document will set forth a plan outlining the steps necessary to procure hardware, install the OS and Service software, and bring the service online as a production level critical service. 

---++ Proposed Plan 
A detailed [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/goc-prop.pdf][implementation plan]] is available.
(Author list is only S. Teige, other authors will be added after review, document will be added to document repository at that time.)
  
---+++ Hardware
4 DELL R415 dual quad-core, 8 GB RAM, GigE network, RAID plus hot spare 250 GB, $4,200 each.
Slightly exceeds minimum system described by CERN technical specification document and includes 1 spare node
for backup and maintenance purposes.

---+++ Software
BDII version currently running at CERN. Puppet for system management, current monitor and RSV probes modified as appropriate for this instance
Current install methods including CVS version control and explicit roll-back mechanisms.

---+++ High Availability Options
Linux Virtual System strongly preferred, Linux HA possible, DNS Round Robin strongly not recommended.

---++ Service Concerns
SLA to be negotiated but service must be considered critical. Existing BDII SLA is a model. 
Same change management process as current services plus explicit sign-off by ATLAS, CMS and production manager.

---++ Estimated Schedule and Effort 
Note: This schedule is an estimate and relative to the start date. I&#39;ve picked February 14th as a &quot;GO&quot; date. 

---+++ Schedule
   * Feb 14th - Accounting paperwork and ordering and shipping &lt;br&gt;
   * Feb 28th - Hardward arrives at IU &lt;br&gt;
   * Mar 2nd - Hardware racked, OS and Network functional &lt;br&gt;
   * Mar 15th - Testable BDII Structure in Place &lt;br&gt;
   * Mar 16th - Testing Begun and Drafting of SLA &lt;br&gt;
   * Mar 22nd (or April 12th)- Release in Production &lt;br&gt;

   * Approximate time from the word GO to Production: 1.5-2 Months

---+++ Effort
   * 1 Week - Ordering, Hardware and Network Installation
   * 1 Week - Setting up BDII V5 on Hardware, some of this to be provided by CERN staff
   * 2-5 Weeks - Testing and Service Transition to Production, it is anticipated most of this effort is provided by stakeholders.
   * ~0.2 FTE Long Term Support 

---++ Conclusion
_To be added after discussion_
