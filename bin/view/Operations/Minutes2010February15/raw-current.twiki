   * Last week&#39;s availability metrics
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yh3t766][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]] 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yhbmbzl][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/goc-service-update-tuesday-february-9th.html][Production release Tuesday - Feb 9th 14:00 UTC]]* complete
      * MyOSG 1.15 
      * GOC Ticket 1.14
      * OIM 2.14
         * No service outages
      * RSV Collector 1.06.14 
         * The production RSV collector was down for about two hours during this upgrade; records were collected back from clients when the collector came back up. Nebraska did not come back up after the outage. Nebraska should be particularly watched in future upgrades.
   * *GOC-TX* 
      * (This concerns the project where we are developing an exchange with webservices; our production system is functioning as normal)
      * With USATLAS RT: Ongoing testing - mostly working
      * With FNAL Remedy: No update, GOC waiting on access to FNAL system
   * *GOC Debian repo*: Anand/Dave Dykstra figured out additional changes required to ensure this works properly; waiting on LIGO testing results before production deployment. We will be releasing 1.11 when it is ready.


---++ Operations This Week
   * *LHC*: Return to data collection; watch for tickets, etc. with wide-open eyes!
   * *Gratia Accounting service moving to new hardware on Thursday, Feb 18 2010 09:00 Central*
      * Data collection and DB updates will be suspended to allow a copy of the live DB. Reports will still be available at this time, but obviously will not include data not received. This procedure is expected to take 4-6 hours, during which time,  data will be backlogged by probes and sent when service resumes.
      * On Thursday, Feb 25 2010 (Time??), the migration will occur. Since this will involve a migration of service IPs to the already set-up and operating new systems, the outage for each service is expected to be under 5 minutes barring unforeseen circumstances. Any probes attempting to contact during this time will backlog the data and re-send as before upon resumption of service. In addition, Gratia proposes to retire the unused &quot;GRATIA-ITB-OSG-PERM&quot; service at this time. 
      * The upgrade is expected to result in a significant increase in performance. 
      * The nightly reports should have already gone out before the upgrades, people should only notice if checking their probes that the records will not be sent during the upgrade. 
      * Chris is requesting a degraded service/partial outage option from OIM downtime schedule.
      * We agree that WLCG ops should be notified of this.
   * *GOC-TX*
      * With USATLAS RT: Further ongoing testing .. No ETA yet on move to new system because of production upgrade freeze
      * With FNAL Remedy: Continue new web service based GOC-FNAL ticket exchange work once GOC gets FNAL system access
   * *GOC Debian repo*: If LIGO testing succeeds, then deploy CA-dist 1.11 to production 
   * *Internal System Improvements*: GOC will continue working on improvement monitoring its own services, etc. through this month

&lt;h2&gt;WLCG Ops&lt;/h2&gt;
   * Retest of the GGUS ALARM Mechanisms this morning
      * Both BNL and FNAL tickets were opened in a timely manor. 
      * New mechanism to SMS the Ops Coordinator did not work. Investigation ongoing.
      * Fermilab had this Alert hit the bit bucket due to MIS VO routing.
      * The SMS contains the GGUS ticket # identifier but not the resulting ticket number in the ticket systems. 
   * Ticket 8101 - UTA_SWT2 SRM tests are failing
   * Some corrupted messages for RSV records to WLCG. ActiveMQ bug opened. 
      * 6 outages in January and 4 outages in February
      * Brian Bockleman thinks we should monitor the broker more carefully and record upload failure
         * Rob explained that there is some dialogue going on in management about ways we could participate in monitoring OSG information to the WLCG.

&lt;h2&gt;AOB&lt;/h2&gt;
   * Chander requested https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/opentickets to show first opened date.
