   * Display Squid Information for Sites
   * Displace Gratia Information (#3460)
      * Message from Chris Green:
Hi,
 
Now that Gratia reporting is a requirement for OSG0.6.0, we&#39;d like to be able to have VORS show
the last-seen date for Gratia probes for each site. There is a URL for this purpose: please see
http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration/monitor-status.html?sitename=FNAL_GPFARM (or equivalently http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8881/gratia-
administration/monitor-status.html?sitename=FNAL_GPFARM_TEST for ITB sites). Ideally, sites
would be able to tell at a glance whether their probes are operating).
 
This page can also respond specifically to probename (eg http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/
gratia-administration/monitor-status.html?probename=condor:fngp-osg.fnal.gov) but I think the
sitename variant is more appropriate for GOC&#39;s purposes.
 
I&#39;d be grateful if you could contact us to discuss feasibility and next steps.
 
Thanks for your time,
Chris Green for the Gratia team.
