---++++ Grid Operations Center
   * ITB release, no issues encountered

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Enabled dual stack in GOC-ITB factory services to test some ipv6 only CMS sites
   * Upgraded GOC-ITB to glideinWMS 3.2.17
   * Discovered bug in 3.2.17 where pid file remains after stopping factory, causing service to refuse to restart unless manually removed
      * Only happens ~50% of the time, likely some kind of race condition
      * glideinWMS developers were notified, they are working on a fix
      * No plans to upgrade production factories until we get 3.2.18 with a fix
