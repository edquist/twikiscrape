   * ITB Release:
      * OIM 2.25
      * MyOSG 1.27
      * GOC Ticket 1.27
      * Ticket Synchronizer 1.13
      * Install Redhat updates, including kernel update for the x86_64 32-bit compatibility mode stack pointer corruption vulnerability, which will require reboots (however, we will be using the DNS round-robin to avoid downtime on the services that utilize it)

---++++ Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by !FermiGrid Ops)
      * System ress02 now has 32GB of RAM
      * Systems ress01 and ress02 rebooted to get latest security updates
      * Gratia database was behind for period from 9/16/10 to 9/21/10, root cause was that an unexpected database housekeeping process was unexpectedly restarted when the system rebooted as part of the 9/16/10 unscheduled Fermilab network outage.  Process was stopped and made so that it won&#39;t autorestart again.

---++ Operations This Week

   * Production Release (identical to ITB release)
   * GUMS template update
   * Expect brief outages for TWiki and OIM. 
   * BDII will operate at reduced capacity for two hours (single server while other is updated)

---++++ Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by !FermiGrid Ops)
   * Gratia machines will reboot on Wed. 9/29/10 to pick up security updates.  High availability will keep user reports available throughout the process.   Remote gratia probes will wait to send data until the collectors are back up.
