---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesFebruary26][previous meeting]]
 
---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG Site Characteristics and Capabilities Survey _John Urish_

An email was sent out this morning to all site administrators. Talked to Burt today and Eileen on Friday and they&#39;ll fill out surveys. They&#39;ll be calling administrators for the information. The goal is to obtain accurate information on what the sites report and an accurate view of what resources are available on the OSG. The survey should help us identify which sites are reporting information by matching up the responses with what is registered in the registration database. Ruth suggested that site administrators should be encouraged to come to the Operations Meeting with any discussions regarding the survey.

2) DZero Production Run Update
   * Request to install CEMon on resources
   * Continuing to run jobs. 50% of the events that they would like have gone through. CEmon installation instructions are available for those sites that are not moving to 0.6.0 but wish to have this package installed on their CE(s). DZero hasn&#39;t had any sites that have been able to run their jobs consistently. LIGO (PSU) and Fermilab have allocated resources available to DZero. 

3) Upgraded Sites (moved to 0.6.0)
   * TTU
   * GROW
   * Vanderbilt

Support Centers plans for upgrades

   * Fermilab - Thursday the gateway, others will follow.
   * CMS - information flow to bdii is up and functioning, then move to 0.6.0. After that, most sites within two weeks, except MIT.
   * LIGO - Milwaukee in a week or two, PSU in a day or two
   * STAR - ??
   * DOSAR - need to determine if it will break samgrid or atlas jobs. So maybe April
   * GROW - within two weeks, Northern Iowa
   * USATLAS - soon.

---++ OSG RA Items

Doug questioned Ian about the new VO registration for SBGrid. Doug will call him about DOE Grid certificates. 

---++ Pending Registrations

---+++ VO: SBGrid

Community Supported. Structoral Biology. 65% completion for moving to GLOBUS. Condor has been deployed and they have favored Grid Engine instead. They&#39;ll be setting up a gatekeeper shortly. No VOMS server yet. EB approval received and GOC will run the registration through the SOP and close ticket.

---+++ Resource: GAIA

Production CE supported by Fermilab via CDF. It is a CDF-based Resource in Canada. Managed by several particle-physics collaborations. Authentication with the MIS DN is failing. Once the authentication and site_verify pass, the site will be added to monitoring and the registration will be published.

---++ [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/tickets][Tickets]]

---+++ Fermilab

   * 2577 Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID
      * The SAZ developer is still debugging. The ?? with the Purdue CA is different and failing.

   * 3168 Fermi/Remedy - 93366 - Authentication error on !UWMadisonCMS
      * The user confirmed this issue is resolved and the ticket may be closed.

---+++ USATLAS

   * 2989 Site failing critical site_verify tests - HAMPTONU
      * Have you received an update from Vassilios? He was needing help with Grid Admin privileges.

---+++ VDT

   * 3200 j2sdk timezone issues
       * Rob will follow-up with Alain.

---++ Other issues

None.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

None.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans

Site Admin Questions and Concerns about OSG 0.6.0 Release

1. Kevin at Vanderbilt. They&#39;re running PBS, not Condor and they&#39;re not showing up on Gratia reporting. Gratia expects your running scheduler on the same machine as your software, and they&#39;re not. Gratia expects to have access to the accounting logs, which Vanderbilt does not do. The accounting log could be copied over to the grid gateway so Gratia can find it, but he&#39;ll have to write a perl script to parse data out of the logs. Rob will open a GOC ticket on this for tracking.

2. BDII. CMS needs to be sure interoperability through BDII will continue to work before they go to 0.6.0.
