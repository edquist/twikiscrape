---++ Process
---+++1. VO Registration form submitted
Registration info is automatically entered into registration database and marked as not yet accepted.
---+++2. Spam check
   * OSG Ops looks at info to see if it sensible. 
   * If it is irrational then the record is deleted and no further action is taken.
   * If it is reasonable looking but incomplete then OSG Ops enters email exchange with submitter to verify or correct the information.
---+++3. Is VO already registered?
   * If the VO was already registered then check to see what fields are udpated.
      * If a VO module update is required then create ticket for VO update.
      * Check if any contact information for Footprints ticket system or security contact has changed then add this to VO update ticket, or create new ticket.
      * [How do we know if the VO was already registered, other than memory? Is there a database field to indicate that?]
      * If no fields that require propagation are updated then no further action is required.
   * If VO is not already registered then create new VO registration ticket and do Step 4.
---+++4. Is VO already member of OSG?
   * If in doubt, send question to IEB, and create ticket to track it.
   * If not in doubt, send notification of VO registration to IEB.

---+++5. Process VO Tickets
   * new VO registration ticket
      * verify information in registration database for this VO
         * valid support center, functioning URLs, valid email addresses
      * mark ticket as ready for review at Ops meeting
   * VO update ticket
      * identify all updated fields
      * propagate any updated contact information to Footprints and security databases [any others?]
      * if changes require update to VO module then mark this ticket as ready for review at Ops meeting

---+++6. Operations Meeting ticket review
   * new VO ticket
      * did IEB comment on new VO validity? ticket is defered if IEB questioned or denied the VO registration
         * IEB notification needs to be 2 business days before operations meeting, i.e., send notice to IEB on or before Thursday for a Monday operations meeting.  If less time has elapsed then ticket should be defered until the next operations meeting.
      * is ticket accepted at operations review?
         * if yes, then proceed to propagate contact info and update VO module
         * if not, then return ticket to process to fix it
   * VO update ticket
      * does updated information cause a VO module update?
         * if yes, then proceed to update VO module
      * propagate any contact info changes

---+++7. Update VO Module
   * make changes to pacman cache for new and/or updated VO information
   * test changes somehow
   * send notification of updated VO module to all Support Centers [ops email for each support center]
