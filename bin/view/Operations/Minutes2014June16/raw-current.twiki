---++++ Grid Operations Center
   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2014/06/goc-service-update-tuesday-june-10th-at.html][Release note]]
   * Software release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2014/06/announcing-osg-software-versions-3211.html][Notification]]
   * DigiCert host certs problem
      * Fix went to production Friday afternoon
      * Verified to work
   * Users were reporting a host certificate issue that was causing the prefix before a slash to be omitted in the CN after a host certificate is being issued.  We were able to 
     confirm this and requested DigiCert to investigate.  DigiCert discovered what the issue was that prevented the service_name from being added to the CN on the certificate.  
     They implemented the fix last Friday.

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

Nothing planned.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Upgraded GOC factory to glidienWMS v3_2_5
      * Scott noticed what looked like a huge &quot;drop&quot; in running glideins. In fact what can be seen in our monitoring is a bug fix in v3_2_5 where previously CMS glideins were wrongly magnified by a factor of 10:

---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

---++ Security
   * No new major incidents or vulnerabilities. Security surveys should be getting created as twiki pages for individual area/system owners in the next day or two. Keep an eye out for email.
   * There have been an increasing number of bitcoin mining incidents detected in the research community. We have not experienced any such incident in OSG yet, but we are cautiously watching the incidents in other research infrastructures. The OSG security team would like to take the opportunity to remind you that OSG resources are only for scientific use and bitcoin mining activities are not allowed. We kindly ask you to emphasize this point to your community and ensure that your colleagues are clear on the OSG Accepted Use Policy. We expect VO managers to explain to their members the OSG AUP when a new user joins the collaboration. We would appreciate if you also send out a note to your community to remind them that such behavior will have consequences for the user, VO, and the resources.

---++ Action Items from Meeting
   * Text similar to &quot;if you are not sure, ask&quot; should be added to the OSG AUP policy
