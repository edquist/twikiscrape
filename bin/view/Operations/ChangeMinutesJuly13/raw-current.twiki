Soichi&#39;s suggestion:

   * GOC will host a replicated MySQL DB
   * We will split our current GIP data streams into following 3 categories
      * Monitor Data: What jobs are running, etc.. (updated every minute?)
      * Status: Current resource status (updated every 30 minutes?)
      * Topology: OIM hierarchy type information (updated rarely)
   * Date is collected via REST interface exposed via Apache at GOC which will be inserted to the MySQL DB for all 3 data streams.
   *  Each data streams from GIP will be sent via &quot;curl&quot; (instead of our current gSOAP based solution or Brian&#39;s Python script)
   * GOC&#39;s BDII LDAP instances will be updated periodically based on the data stored in the MySQL DB (snapshot)
   * End user will continue to access BDII LDAP to query data, or access MySQL DB directly for the latest data.
