7/31/16 @22:23 gums2 went down and the primary got paged.  gums2 is the 
host for gums.fnal.gov.

7/31/16 @22:44 gums2 was brought back up by secondary and check_mk 
alarms cleared.

This morning at around 7:38am we noticed that gums.fnal.gov was not 
responding.  Upon further investigation it appears that when gums2 
rebooted the OS decided to rename the network interface and the device 
that gums.fnal.gov was assigned to was not setup to be &#39;ON&quot; at boot time.

Requests started getting on gums.fnal.gov and jobs started running by 
~8:45am.  However, on some of the CEs, a service restart was required to 
get jobs flowing again.


To prevent this issues happening in future, we are:

* Using puppet to setup the device configuration such that the device 
name is fixed and will not change again.

* better monitor service ip availability (gums.fnal.gov and 
gums-crit.fnal.gov)

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * No changes planned

---++++ OSG-Connect
   * Fixing NIS membership issue, shouldn&#39;t affect operations
