---++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2010February01][Previous Meeting Agenda]]
   * Last week&#39;s availability metrics
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yc2x8vj][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]] 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yjo5bev][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
         * Some virtual resource_groups were showing 0% availability .. GOC proposes new metric in which VOMS metric will report critical only if more than 10% of VOMS servers are down; Security agrees.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/oim-213-bug-patched.html][OIM 2.13 patched to fix bug with downtime editor]]
      * Chance for erroneous downtime data for downtimes that were set in recent weeks. 
         * This only applies to users who EDITED AN *EXISTING* DOWNTIME BETWEEN Jan 26th and Feb 5. If you added a downtime in that time frame but never tried to go back and edit it then this does *not* impact you. 
         * Between January 26th 14:00 (when version 2.13 of OIM was released) and Feb 5th 17:00 UTC, OIM had a bug that was causing users to not be able to update already set downtimes. What made this even worse is that while it failed to update the DB with new content a user provided, the web interface was actually showing the updated content thereby leading users to think all is well!
      * GOC opened ticket to contact (via ticket CC) users who possibly edited downtimes during this time frame: [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8077][https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8077]]
