---+ Post Upgrade Functionality Checks

This document is to provide a list of checks that will test the functionality of the Software service after an upgrade has been done. It is assumed the DNS round robin (RR) mechanism was used during the maintenance period and these checks should be performed before an instance is returned to round robin.

If the RR mechanism was not used, you may skip this part but must perform the other checks on both instances.

   * Verify which instance has been removed from RR with dig. 
      * software1.grid.iu.edu is 129.79.14.161
      * software2.grid.iu.edu is 134.68.22.138
      * dig, for example, returns this:
&lt;pre&gt;
2011-06-29 14:12:53 UTC [steige@jump:~]$ dig software.grid.iu.edu

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.3.6-P1-RedHat-9.3.6-16.P1.el5 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; software.grid.iu.edu

software.grid.iu.edu.   2877    IN      A       129.79.14.161

&lt;/pre&gt;

   * Note that 134.68.22.138 is not in the &quot;ANSWER SECTION&quot; returned from dig. This means software2.grid.iu.edu is the instance removed for maintenance and is the instance to be checked.

   * Verify the availability of the distributions. Pages should load in a reasonable time and contain content. Compare the content from software1 and software2. If the maintenance was a version change the content will not be identical but should be similar. 
   * For software1:
      * [[http://software1.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2/][Index of software]]
         * open a few of the items seen here and verify they point to software.grid.iu.edu
