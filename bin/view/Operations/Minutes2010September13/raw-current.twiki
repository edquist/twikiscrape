---++++ Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by Fermigrid Ops)
   *  [INC 52188/GOC 9185] On Tuesday 07-Sep-2010, the OSG Grid operations center reported
   that Gratia collector GRATIA-OSG-PROD was failing a metric test, examination
   showed a confused OS and the gr12x5 database system was rebooted to restore
   operation.

   * [INC 50796/GOC 9136] there are intermittent failures of OSG display to read the reporting database,
    we believe that these can be mitigated by changing mysql parameters on the client (GOC) side.

   * We are working trying to test the recently-added ReSS ticket option on goc-ticket page, GOC 9195 never made it to FNAL Service desk
