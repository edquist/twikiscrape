---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesMarch12][previous meeting]]
 
---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO spotlight - fGOC

Operations center for resource providers. Helps support 5-6 sites around Florida. Some of which are active, some are not. There are two elements at UF, which is an education and outreach cluster, supporting all VO&#39;s, registered as UFlorida-EO, which was used for last summer&#39;s grid workshop. FIU cluster has been on OSG since the early beginning of OSG. HPC, high performance compute facility, looking to wrap up OSG activity. FSU cluster is going to be brought in. fGOC is there to support sites w/middleware stack issues.

2) DZero Production Run Update

Improving, 2 days ago 2.4 million events...highest total yet! 90% efficiencies a few months ago. They&#39;ve changed the software to sesubmit with a higher failure rate. In the past few days the problems occurring have been on the DZero end with SAM and a headnode crash. The timeout issues at IU have been resolved. GOAL: 

Observe sites they&#39;re running on at  http://www-d0.fnal.gov/computing/reprocessing/p20/stats/Stats.html

 This shows the overall number of events DZero is able to process each day:

The last 4 links shows the performance of each site as far as efficiency, and number of idle jobs.  The job log size link shows the size of the log files.  As the size of the log file is related to what the problems are, this allows us to visually show where the failures are occuring.


3) Upgraded Sites (moved to 0.6.0)
   * TTU
   * GROW
   * Vanderbilt
   * LIGO
   * Fermigrid
