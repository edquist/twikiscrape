---++ Executive Summary
This SLA is an agreement between OSG Operations and the OSG Stakeholders describing details of the OSG BDII Information Service. The BDII service runs separately and independently on hardware at Indiana University and Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis and consists of the CEMon Server data collection software, the Berkeley Database Information Index (BDII), and GOC provided software which serves as the bridge between CEMon and BDII. A DNS round-robin system is used for access, redundancy, and load-balancing. 

---++ Owners
The BDII SLA is owned by OSG Operations and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team.

---++ Service Name and Description
---+++ !!Name
GOC Production BDII
---+++ !!Description
The GOC Production BDII service consumes raw GLUE information from CEMon client located at the OSG Resource level and serves it to OSG users in ldap friendly format. The BDII service consists of two independent BDII software structures available using DNS round-robining techniques.

---++ Security Considerations
The BDII does not gather or distribute any information deemed as private. It will be subject to Indiana University institutional policy. Access to any of the hardware or software will be restricted to OSG Operations staff. Other OSG staff, upon request, may be giving access to a development version of the BDII for experimenting with new software updates, changes in database/GLUE schema, or for stress testing.
