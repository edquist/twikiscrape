---++ TWiki authentication
   * FNAL certs issue is ongoing. Working with Jemise to get the problem solved. Other users have switched to DoE certs and are happy.
   * (Related to the last TWiki X509 authentication) Streamlined the Apache configuration files so that user can now access http:// URLs without being redirected to https:// Also, https:// will autologin if valid X509 certificate is provided.
---++ BDII upgrade
   * is4 (Indianapolis, on metal) is up and running. Had to shutdown and restart Friday due to insufficient size of /var partition. Testing resumed at that time. 
      * Initial stress test reported 2.03k hits per minute, roughly equal to current is1+is2 rate.
      * Investigating monitor properties now. (v5 does not create bdii-fwd processes, counting these was a powerful diagnostic for v4) Currently investigating/understanding others.
      * Xin and Hiro report everything looks fine.
