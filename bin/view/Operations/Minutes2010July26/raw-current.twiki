   * Gratia database issues Tuesday, Wednesday.

    [INC 46105,46329] Following last weeks Gratia software upgrade on the OSG
    Gratia collector/reporter systems, an email discussion began late on
    Monday 19-Jul-2010 regarding slow updates to the OSG Gratia collectors.
    A formal ticket was entered into the GOC ticketing system at 0856 CDT
    on Tuesday 20-Jul-2010:

        https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8929

    At 0912 (16 minutes after the ticket was entered), investigation by
    FermiGrid determined that the underlying cause was a Gratia software
    issue and the ticket was reassigned to Gratia Development and Support.
    Philippe Canal and Chris Green (with the assistance of Dan Yocum and
    Steve Timm) spent a large number of hours diagnosing the cause (Gratia
   &quot;housekeeping&quot;) and developing temporary workarounds for the issue.

    As of 21:26 on Wednesday 21-Jul-2010, the Gratia collector was keeping
    up with incoming records, and &quot;housekeeping&quot; has (once again) been
    disabled on the gratia-transfer collector.
    Potential long term fixes are being discussed between the Gratia
    developers, FermiGrid operations and other OSG stakeholders.  Once a real fix has
    been determined, it will be discussed with the stakeholders prior to
    scheduling the change.

     As part of the above diagnostic work, new Ganglia metrics were added and
     a consolidated Ganglia &quot;dashboard&quot; for Gratia was commissioned:

   * This will be discussed further tomorrow at the Ops Review
