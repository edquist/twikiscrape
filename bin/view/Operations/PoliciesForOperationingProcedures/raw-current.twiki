---+ Policies Governing Operating Procedures
OSG needs (and does or will have) policies governing the operating requirements
for resource and service providers as well as OSG internal procedures.

This page is a collection of the identified policies that are needed.
We anticipate that these policies will result in agreements with resource/service providers
specifying how the policies are implemented. These may be some combination of blanket agreements and specific agreements with each provider.

---++ Policy for OSG interaction with Resource/Service Providers
Items to cover in the policy.
   * OSG Ops runs functional tests periodically on this resource/service
      * Ops can take some action when tests fail or do not meet required QOS.
   * Specify necessary QOS
