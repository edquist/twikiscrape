---++ Other Issues
---+++ Grid Monitor Issue With Condor
   * The directory has correct permissions in 0.4.0 and old version 0.2.1 was writing to different file. Condor G on the submit site, Documentation/Release3.GridMonitor on the submit side. This will need to be brought up again at the VDT office hours. If the Gatekeeper $VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp set to 1777 this is the recommended solution, but we are not sure this is a solution. 
---+++ Storage Element Validation
   * Production instance is the old version of GridCat. GridCat is using the GIP to do the validation. Pull information from GIP. Local storage admin guide in Twiki, who owns this? This has not been updated for 0.2.1. Pull SRM package from LBL. This document is in the KB. LDAP information is not being pulled correctly. This needs 2 weeks in the ITB. UCSD and FNAL are in the ITB GridCat.
