---+++ End of life announcement - USCMS VO at Fermilab - July 31, 2006
   * All users of USCMS resources were supposed to have migrated into the cms VO at CERN by the end of February 2006. GUMS configs may need to be updated by replacing the USCMS VO at Fermilab w/the one at CERN.

---++ OSG RA Items
Specify OSG RA rather than PPDG or iVDGL when submitting requests. There is no date defined for the removal of PPDG and iVDGL from the list of projects, perhaps September.
   * Friday a bug discovered in the cert request script. The name of the person wasn&#39;t being passed to the site, and that data is required. Persons using the scripts should update to the latest versions.
