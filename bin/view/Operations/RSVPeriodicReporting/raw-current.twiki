---++ RSV Periodic Reporting Formats

The following describes the fields requested for daily reporting [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics/RsvReportsOverview][(Overview)]] for RSV.

---+++ Daily Site Report
 Delivered every morning to the CMS and ATLAS T2 mailing lists; the compute and storage elements listed are filtered appropriately.

For Compute Elements

%TABLE{tableborder=&quot;2&quot;}%
| Resource Name | Daily Availbility % | % Diff From Previous Period | Daily Reliability % | Version | CE Permissions | | |

For Storage Elements (any resource with service SRMv2 or BestmanXrootd)

| Resource Name | Daily Availbility % | % Diff From Previous Period | Daily Reliability % | Version | CE Permissions | CE certificates | GRAM | ping |

The Availability and Reliability on this are for the service (CE or SRMv2/BestmanXrootd) only; they are computed using the WLCG availability algorithm. The individual test information is the percentage of OK results out of all test results (specifically it is not using the availability algorithm).

---+++ Daily OSG Report

Delivered every morning to the osg-accounting-info and osg-sites mailing list.

%TABLE{tableborder=&quot;2&quot;}%

For WLCG Sites

| Site Name | Daily % | Weekly % | Monthly % | Month to date % | Algorithm type (availability or reliability) |

For OSG Sites

| Site Name | Daily % | Weekly % | Monthly % | Month to date % | Algorithm type (availability or reliability) |

*Note:* we use &quot;Site&quot; in the SAM Site sense of the word throughout all the reports and this document. The equivalent is *not* a OIM site, but an OIM *resource group*. If the site has enabled WLCG reporting, but is not a WLCG !MoU site, there is a &#39;*&#39; beside their name.

The weekly numbers exclude the previous day; the monthly numbers do not (and here, month is taken to be 30 days). The &quot;Month To Date&quot; column is from the first of the month to the current day, as WLCG numbers are computed from beginning to the end of the month. 

Each site has two rows - one for availability numbers, and a second for reliability numbers. Each table has an AVERAGE row at the bottom showing the site averages.

Next, there is a table showing the distribution of site performances. For example, here is the 9-22 table:

| | Today | 7 Days | 30 Days |
| Reporting  |  84 |  84 |  84 |
| 90-100% avail. |  33 |  38 |  36 |
| 60-90% avail.  |  5 |  4 |  7 |
| 30-60% avail.  |  2 |  0 |  2 |
| 0-30% avail.  |  39 |  40 |  38 |

Then, for each service type (the current service types are SRMv2, SRMv1, !BestmanXrootd, and CE), we have the following table:

| Resource Name | Daily % | Weekly % | Monthly % |

We show the resource providing the service and the percentages are for the WLCG availability of that service. Each service table has an &quot;AVERAGE&quot; row like the sites have.

Finally, we show a table for service statistics which shows the following columns

| Service Name | Resource Count | Average Daily % | Average Weekly % | Average Monthly % |

---+++ Daily Comparison Report

Delivered every morning to CMS, ATLAS, and the GOC.

%TABLE{tableborder=&quot;2&quot;}%

| Site Name | RSV Availability | WLCG Availability | Difference | RSV Reliability | WLCG Reliability | Difference |

This enables GOC to watch for RSV and SAM service availability problems which might cause a difference in the availability numbers between the two systems. This uses the development !MyWLCG XML interface.

---+++ The LHC algorithm for computing availability and reliability
