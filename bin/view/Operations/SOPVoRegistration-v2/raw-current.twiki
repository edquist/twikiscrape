   * OSG Ops looks at info to see if it sensible.

   * A ticket is created for processing this request.
   * If it is reasonable looking but incomplete then OSG Ops enters email exchange with submitter to verify or correct the information.
---+++3. Is VO already registered?
   * If the VO was already registered then check to see what fields are udpated.
      * If a VO module update is required then note that in ticket.
      * Check if any contact information for Footprints ticket system or security contact has changed then add this to ticket.
      * [How do we know if the VO was already registered, other than memory? Is there a database field to indicate that?]
      * If no fields that require propagation are updated then no further action is required.  Check with submitter on why new form was submitted.
