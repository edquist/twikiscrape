---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Continue testing glideinWMS v3_2_11_2, may upgrade SDSC factory assuming testing goes well.

---++++ OSG-Connect

   * Unexpected web outage Thursday 9/17 when a KVM host failed. Services resumed within ~2h as VMs were migrated to another host. No lasting damage or data loss.
   * Accounting: utilization has been underreported to Gratia for $longtime due to undetected backlog in gratia probe queue. ~600k job history files piled up in excess of 1y back. Trigger unknown; possibly a very large influx of jobs during a period that Gratia was unavailable. However probe processing time is exponential due to full directory scan *per entry*. Once Gratia probe queue exceeds some breaking point, it can no longer drain as quickly as it fills. Constant monitoring of Gratia queue required. Anyway: full backlog processed as of 10pm Thursday. Many months of retrospective history uploaded to Gratia server.
