---++ Issues from Service Developers and Providers

---+++ Important Service Enhancements
   * Integrate dynamic resource availability information based on data provided by the OSG BDII Information System which in turn is based on Generic Information Provider (GIP) data.
   * Parallel deployment-cases of the !MyOSG application. (!MyEGEE)
   * Move various information currently associated with OIM resources to be optionally associated with OIM resource groups in order to override resource specific information. This currently applies to WLCG information, and downtime information. 
   
---+++ Desired Service Enhancements
   * Integrate more VO-provided tools and information generated by such tools. 
   * Re-engineer RSV process which cleans and analyzes RSV probe data. We currently employs highly intelligent but complicated algorithm to handle out-of-order metrics that can analyze the effected data due to a probe metric being applied to past time line of the status changes. I&#39;d like to replace this with simpler decision tree type algorithm that allows more complex &amp; organic overall status calculation and handle out of order metrics either by ignoring micro-out of ordering and rerun the calculation for macro-out of ordering.
   * Remove current RSV status cache (/tmp/cache.current_resource_???.xml) and instead pull data from the DB. This caching is causing out-of-sync issues and is not giving us enough performance gain.
 
---+++ Bells and Whistles
   * MyOSG UI is way too clouded. For new users, it has overwhelming amount of information that is displayed, and we need to reduce the clutter as much as possible while at the same time providing the same functionality. 
   * Display visual representation of OIM topology to help users who are new to OSG can conceptualize the overall structure of OSG and its hierarchy. 
   * Consider adding treemap views for number of CPUs available/installed (once we add that information from the information system), number of VOs supported, etc. by a resource group
