---++ OSG Operations Information Center (a.k.a Operations Dashboard ) - Project Plan

%RED%(NOTE: This is a rough draft of this project plan to get some discussion started. Comments/suggestions are welcome! Please email the GOC!) %ENDCOLOR%
---+++ Introduction

The OSG has a plethora of tools that various groups develop, and use. A lot of users find a variety of these tools useful in their user experience. Unfortunately, GOC staff, and other support staff, find it hard to keep up with all the tools, and their accesibility, at times when they are trying to debug an issue related to a trouble ticket. Additionally, several new users (and new site administrators) have repeteadly pointed out that most of these tools are hard to find, and that there is no one place that provides them with all the pieces of information they need.

The Operations Information Center (aka Operations Dashboard) is intended to address some of these concerns. The primary idea is to use an authoritative source of information about OSG sites, resources, services, etc., and collate all possible tools to be accessible in a single portal. The OSG Information Management system (OIM) will serve as that source of information.

Another way to look at this idea of an Operations Information Center is a sort of a collection of gadgets on Google&#39;s [[http://www.google.com/ig][iGoogle page].

The key is to produce a collating tool with as minimal of a development effort as possible.
---+++ Prototype based on RSV Viewer

Currently, the OSG GOC has developed a [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/][prototype of an Operation Info Center]] ... it is based on the RSV resource/service availability web interface (which is being developed as part of !RSV phase II).

---+++ Possible tools to integrate into the Operations Information Center
   1 *Gratia Accounting system*: Currently, the Gratia accounting system can be accessed via [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/]]. But conversations with Gratia developers have indicated that these reports can be linked off the Info Center using resource_nam, and specific time intervals. 
   1 *OSG CEMon/BDII Data*:The OSG CEMon/BDII server is one of the vital source of information for users to run jobs. It&#39;s currently accessed by users via ldapsearches to the BDII. But the LDIF data is also available via the web at [[http://is.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi]]. This information can easily be made accessible via the information center. 
   1 *ReSS*: !ReSS is another tool that OSG collaborators have suggested we add to the information center. 
   1 *Additional !RSV availability graphs*: Apart from the basic availabilty graph the RSV viewer provides, Brian Bockelman also generates graphs based on the WLCG availability algorithm at [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/rsv_reliability]]. These could be integrated into the information center if required.
   1 *GIP Validator*: Tony Tiradani has come up with an alpha version of a new GIP validator, which can be made accessible via the information center. 

---+++ Additional Facets of the Operations Information Center
   1 Make a more useful map interface; For example, icons on the map could represent various sites on that OSG, and upon expansion, more information about the resource_groups, the services running on those resource_groups will be displayed. Any debugging type information could be printed if there is a problem with a site&#39;s resource. 
   1 A hierarchical view of the OIM database could be published. This is partially already available on the public [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OIM interface]]. The hierarchy will allow users/administrators to drill down their site, their resource group, their services, etc.
