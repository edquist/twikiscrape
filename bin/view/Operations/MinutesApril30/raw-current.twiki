---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) DZero Production Run Update

Throughput has been down a little. SPRACE and LTU sites have been down, so with those large sites down they haven&#39;t been able to run as many jobs. USCMS Tier1 is offering more slots to DZero for their production run.

2) OSG sites upgraded to 0.6.0

   * AGLT2
   * ASGC_OSG
   * CIT_CMS_T2

Last week Burt mentioned that some sites that have upgraded to 0.6.0 appear to be missing from this list. It appears that site_verify may be timing out on those sites. A but has been filed w/the GOC. The bug appears to be due to the reading of files in /etc/xinetd.d and if site_verify can&#39;t read files due to the permissions, it times out and stops rather than skipping and moving on with the tests. Often this failure comes before it can read the OSG_VERSION.

---++ OSG RA Items

Looking into means to handle large requests of host/service certificates.

---++ Pending Registrations

---+++ USATLAS

3322 Site failing critical site_verify tests - HAMPTONU
   * Attempts to reach the admin by phone and email have been fruitless.
   * OS upgrade pending. Wonders if he should stay with 0.4.0 or 0.6.0. We suggest a move to 0.6.0.

---+++USCMS

3281 corrupted CMSSW dataset files at FNAL (cmslcgce.fnal.gov)
   * GGUS&lt;-&gt;CMS interaction we need an update for GOC ticket.
   * Burt will check into how the ticket was routed. He has no recollection of this ticket.

There was no meeting today due to the holiday.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans

Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA&#39;s deprecation is not appreciated. Gratia and the other monitoring tools don&#39;t provide a lot of useful data on a day to day basis as to what&#39;s going on. Wayne from STAR brought this issue up and was going to compile the data they are looking to obtain. Status?
   * Current status data is what he&#39;s mainly interested in, but he also looks at the historical data.
   * Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA is an optional package. It&#39;s a heavy JAVA package...two reasons we are moving away from it. The deprecation of ML is being discussed with the Executive Board at the next meeting. LIGO also likes the information being provided. But the GOC needs to know what data is being used so that we can make efforts to provide that data. Jobs per VO plots were mentioned specifically. Please send this data to the GOC if you&#39;re needing to retain ML functionality.
