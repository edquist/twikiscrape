Critical Level Security Issues will be elevated immediately to the OSG Security Team. 

Detailed information on contacts are viewable on the following [[https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/rgsummary/index?datasource=summary&amp;summary_attrs_showhierarchy=on&amp;summary_attrs_showservice=on&amp;summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&amp;summary_attrs_showcontact=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showfqdn=on&amp;account_type=cumulative_hours&amp;ce_account_type=gip_vo&amp;se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&amp;start_type=7daysago&amp;start_date=09/15/2009&amp;end_type=now&amp;end_date=09/15/2009&amp;site_10047=on&amp;rg=on&amp;rg_246=on&amp;gridtype=on&amp;gridtype_1=on&amp;voown=on&amp;voown_25=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;disable_value=1][MyOSG URL]], and are maintained within the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OSG Information Management]] system (for editing purposes only).

Any ongoing &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Elevated&quot; level issues will be discussed at the weekly [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes][Operations]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings][Production]] meetings.

---++ Service Availability and Outages
The GOC will strive for 90% service availability. If service availability falls below 90% monthly as monitored by the GOC a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders for plans to restore an acceptable level of service availability.

Reliability and availability will be determined by 2 critical RSV probes and the OSG availability algorithm.
   * One probe will verify the Condor collector is queryable whenever the host is pingable (i.e., reasonably not a network failure).
   * The other probe will verify an automatically generated configuration file has been updated recently

---++ Service Support Hours
This service will be run for 24x7, but support will primarily be within business hours.  The exception is for security incidents.

---++ Service Off-Hours Support Procedures
All operational issues should be reported as per [[#Customer_Problem_Reporting][Customer Problem Reporting]] section.

---++ Requests for Service Enhancements
OSG Operations will provide enhancement capabilities only as they are released by the !HTCondor project or OSG Technology Group. 
Requests for customization of the deployed service may be made; OSG Operations has the right of up to one month of testing of any change.

OSG will give 1 week of warning prior to any change in the Collector service version.
At any time during this week, Stakeholders are permitted to request a delay for up to 1 week after the originally scheduled upgrade. 

OSG Operations will schedule downtimes and configuration changes during normal business hours unless approved by affected stakeholders.  This is done so affected stakeholders are always on-hand in case if the downtime and changes cause further issues.


---++ Customer Problem Reporting
The GOC provides operators 24x7x365. Problems should be reported immediately by one of the following mechanisms. 

   * Creating a problem ticket at https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open (*preferred*)
   * Calling the GOC phone at 317-278-9699
   * Emailing a description to goc@opensciencegrid.org


---++ Responsibilities

   * The Collector will be run by OSG Operations and accessible to HTCondor compute elements.
   * Problems not associated with the hardware, operating system or network are the responsibilty of the Technology Group.

---++ Service Measuring and Reporting
The GOC will provide the following reports in the intervals indicated (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually):

%TABLE{tableborder=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; headerbg=&quot;#000099&quot; headercolor=&quot;#DF7401&quot; databg=&quot;#C8CB8F, #DBDDB5&quot; headerrows=&quot;2&quot; footerrows=&quot;1&quot; }%
| *Report Name* | *Reporting Interval* | *Delivery Method* | *Responsible Party* | 
| System Availability and Reliability | Monthly | Web Posting | GOC |

---++ SLA Validity Period

This SLA will be in affect for one year.

---++ SLA Review Procedure

This SLA will renew automatically on a yearly basis unless change or update is requested by the OSG Operations Coordinator, the OSG Executive Team or the Stakeholders.
