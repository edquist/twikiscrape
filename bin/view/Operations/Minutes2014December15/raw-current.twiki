   * Standard Third Thursday downtime coming up this week.  All batch machinery will get rebooted for kernel updates so some running jobs will get killed and possibly restarted.  Some internal Fermilab services will be down for a few hours for work on our Redhat Cluster.  External users should just see the quick reboots.

---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

---++ Security
   * Vulnerability in FTS &amp; GFAL received from EGI. If any OSG sites are using it, they should upgrade. Requires a valid account, so should not open up to outside threats, but could lead to accidents.
   * Work continues on condor-ce incident drill. Got confirmation with log samples on cert based submission. Waiting on spare cycles from Nebraska admins to look into glidein based scenario, although largely already covered by traceability project.
   * Updating security risk assessment.
