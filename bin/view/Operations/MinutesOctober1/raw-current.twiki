---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesSeptember24][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. VO spotlight on LIGO 

Since April, the number of sites for LIGO to run on the OSG has grown from 10 sites to 24 sites.
There are still problems at 6 of those sites, so 18 sites are fully accessible.
Britta will escalate these issues to the Troubleshooting group.
Several different LIGO workflows have been tested, varying in the number of jobs to the required disk space,
Britta reported on metrics of runtimes across 9 OSG sites and 1 ITB site.  
Other smaller sites on the OSG have not been tested as extensively.
LIGO September milestone for OSG, reached on Aug 23rd - 1k jobs running concurrently
Previously tested workflow data had no scientific value, LIGO can run on the OSG

2. Chris Green discussed the first general release of an extensible VO-centric site testing kit, &quot;osg-vo-test&quot;
Chris has been working on for months on a part time basis, first mentioned back in March and again in July.
It is now in a general release state with useful documentation on its webpage.  Link Here:
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/OsgVoSiteTests][OSG VO Site Test Kit]]

Its purpose is to allow users running jobs to characterize OSG sites 
Includes - new discovery methods, vors text interface, ReSS, fork jobs, command line utlities
Also handles batch jobs if users need to run a script on a worker node to collect results
In a nutshell - enable people to have a fully listed summary of what sites will work for for their jobs (tailored).
Rather than getting a list of all sites, including ones that fail, this will allow users to see useful sites for their needs.
Kit is written in perl, extensible and highly configurable
It is available as a tarball download from doc site (link above)
Discussions will continue on how this will be useful to have packaged as client software
