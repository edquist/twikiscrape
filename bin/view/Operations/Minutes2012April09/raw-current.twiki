   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/04/update-doegrids-certificate-service_04.html][DoEGrids outage]]
      * Affected end user cert renewal, grid admin, and service certs. Some interfaces still worked (cert-request). We are not clear on the root cause of this outage, we are waiting for an explanation from DOEGrids. A configuration change at DOEGrids fixed the issue. 
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-10th.html][ITB release]]
      * Services moving to new IP range
         * Will work closely with all service providers to be sure this is transparent. We should let Glidein Ops know when the change is made and when the old IPs go away. 

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * Should the display-itb be querying the production Gratia collector? Some queries are causing issues at the collector. 

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Continued addressing load issues at UCSD Factory:
      * Reduced number of condor schedds from 20 to 9
      * Saw gridmanagers getting stuck in weird loops.  Jaime discovered a bug and supplied us a patch.  Our load improved greatly since applying the patch.
   * Added OSG XSEDE to ~12 new sites for glidein submission
   * Discovered glideinWMS bug where if we put one VO in temporary downtime from submitting to sites, others get put down as well.
      * SBGrid submission is under extended maintenance... Engage to Tusker were affected. 
      * We put in a temporary workaround.
   * Upgraded UCSD factory to glideinWMS 2.5.7 on Fri Apr 6
      * This fixes the auto held job removal issues we were hitting

---++ Operations This Week
   * Production release
      * Physical move of two servers out of the production rack
