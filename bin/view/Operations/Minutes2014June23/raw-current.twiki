---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Upgraded HTCondor to 8.2 prerelease at SDSC Factory
      * Debugging cream_gahp and nordugrid_gahp segfaults with Jaime Frey - seems related to issues with thread locking
      * We see segfaults in all the factories which run 8.0.5, so this is not new to 8.2.
      * Official 8.2 release will contain the fix
   * IU had internal DNS issues, forcing us to shut off the GOC factory 6/16 17:20 PDT - 6/17 7:09 PDT
      * HTCondor heavily depends on DNS so it caused the GOC factory to effectively stop responding.
      * We brought it back up after Tom Lee confirmed the DNS was fixed
