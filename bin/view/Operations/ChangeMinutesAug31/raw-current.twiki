   * Rob Quick on vacation to 26/Sep
      * Contact Kyle (kagross at indiana dot edu) for Support Issues and Scott (steige at indiana dot edu) for Infrastructure.

---++ SAM uploader failure

   * All recent problems are related to referencing DB on &quot;sonofsam&quot;. This machine is to be retired as soon as possible. To that end, all connection requests to it are currently being logged. This will identify what external processes need to be changed. This log is currently ~24 hours old
   * A monitor is currently in place, generates a phone call (to Scott) if a failure occurs.
   * James Casey has reported he knows of no further use of the reported data than to generate accounting reports. He cannot be sure that data derived from these reports is not used by the VOs for other purposes. 

---++ BDII stale data issue

   * Critical level alarms have been generated on three occasions due to outdated data in the top level BDII. These problems were initially (and only partially successfully) addressed by restarting the service at CERN. A patch has since been applied and the problem has not recurred. The following information regarding the patch is available and will be investigated.
      * [[http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite/packages/R3.2/sl5_x86_64/deployment/glite-BDII/glite-BDII-known-issues.asp][Known issues]]

---++ TWiki Dedicated Hardware Discussion
