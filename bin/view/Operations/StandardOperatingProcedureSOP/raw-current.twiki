%ATTACHURL%/sop-sop.jpg

   1. Write a draft operating procedure
      * Someone from Operations (or other) writes draft procedure (new or updated) and posts on TWiki Operations.DevelopingStandardOperatingProcedures.
      * Author sends notice to Support Centers technical group pointing out new (updated) procedure.
   2. Review of operating procedure
      * the draft operating procedure is reviewed at a Support Centers meeting
      * if the procedure is not approved, the author is notified (usually the author would be at the review meeting) and the author can revise the draft and ask for another review
      * if the procedure is approved (by consensus), this is noted in the meeting minutes
   3. Posting approved SOP
      * An approved SOP is posted at Operations.StandardOperatingProcedures and notice of the approval is sent to the osg-operations email list.
      * The approved SOP should have access control set to limit modifications to only authorized authors, and include a forward link to Operations.StandardOperatingProcedures.
