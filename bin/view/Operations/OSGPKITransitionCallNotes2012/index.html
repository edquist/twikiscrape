It deserves testing before deployment just to be sure we don't have the problem there too. I need go through your deployment details and I would like to encourage you to run a test with gLExec and a CE deployment against SAZ and GUMS using <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> certificates everywhere."

</li> <li> Steve Timm: "we did test SAZ with digicert certificates at the same time we tested GUMS in the testing last fall.  But Mine Altunay has also asked us to do a couple new tests with different proxy configurations that we didn't consider at that time, and that testing is in progress.  We will also test with our own gridsite installation which is part of <span class="twikiNewLink">FermiCloud<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/FermiCloud?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="FermiCloud (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> to see if we see any problems with that."

</li> <li> There is a fix in gridsite CVS. Not sure what the release cycle is for making an RPM, and then when CERN PANDA would pick it up.
</li> <li> This is now an ATLAS issue.

</li> <li> Plan for stress-test of system (OIM-ITB) with <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> on Dec 19? <ul>

</li> <li> Update on FNAL service desk issues (Kevin) <ul>
<li> A couple success stories without re-load (and using IE).
</li> <li> ITB was fixed a couple days ago. Production was fixed today.
</li> <li> Only issue: did not see any instructions on installing <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> root certificate (for Windows). <ul>

</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Ruth: Reports of some people getting certificates from OSG PKI, but FNAL policy says they should be waiting for documentation to be in order. This is an issue between FNAL and its RAs.

AI: Von review hisotry on Grid Admin/domain/VO logic
AI: Von to open JIRAs: (1) Grid Admin request should include VO, (2) Route request to GA based on VO of requestor and GA.

Other business? <ul>
<li> Kevin: Having issues with a couple people on FNAL service desk with IE only being offered PKCS7 instead of PKCS12. <ul>
<li> Alain has been working on this: in bringing on Yolanda, ran into a bit of problem, she and someone else were running into a problem with the page "hanging up" then after refresh they only see PKCS7 (w/o private key) and not PKCS12
</li> <li> We are aware of one issue with IE. Have a work-around with refreshing the page. Not sure if this is the same issue.
</li> <li> Issue is how do they get the private key in PKCS7 file.
</li> <li> We think these issues (refesh and lack of PKCS12) are related.
</li> <li> What version of IE in use by FNAL? v8.0.17xxx on Windows 7 (v9 is not supported).
</li> <li> Folks at FNAL: try renewal at this point.
</li> <li> There is already a JIRA about this: <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-221" target="_top">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-221</a>
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Mine: Other problems with FNAL service desk. Are resolved now. Lesson's learned? <ul>
<li> Problems with registering Yolanda. Had contact-only account. Couldn't associate DN. Alain removed existing account? Tried changing email. Then Alain disabled, then she was able to register. We learned how to disable/enable to clear this issue. Is this an issue with contact-only accounts? Those folks when they register will take over that account. Not sure how we got into a bad state here.
</li> <li> Once we finished registering and registered as RA, couldn't see Approve button. Is resolved now... how did this get fixed? This was related. Take-away is we don't know how we got into bad state. If this happens again we need to debug. Alain now understands how to fix.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Christiane: If certificate isn't issued, what should user do? If user tries to request a new one, they get an error that the email is already in use. Christiane did the "email+something@domain" trick (this is a hack, not something we want to recommend). <ul>
<li> Revocation didn't work.
</li> <li> We need to debug this. If it happens again, we should try to catch it.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Christiane: If they forget the password before issuance, what should they do? They should cancel the request. <ul>
<li> How about after issuance? They should revoke and re-request.
</li> <li> There is a JIRA for a command-line renewal client. Christiane really like this as it avoids users having to put them into their browser. <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-202" target="_top">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-202</a>

Other topics? <ul>
<li> Host request process (Anthony) <ul>
<li> Re Yujun requested host certificate for LQCD, at FNAL but Anthony not authoritative (he is CMS). He is seeing host requests for every experiment at FNAL since we email by domain and not VO. 
</li> <li> AI: Von: OIM knows VO of requestor and GA, can it only notify GAs for VO in question?
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Christiane: Users cannot reapply is request fails because email is already in use.
</li> <li> When we will request RAs be signing up for VOs? <ul>
<li> FNAL RAs have not signed up yet. We don't know why?
</li> <li> AI: Von to check with John Benson as to why.
</li> <li> People requesting user certs from OSG VO because they don't know where else to go - their VO was not available. If they can provide with Sponsor, Alain will go ahead and process it. Some can provide and some cannot.
</li> <li> Our correct response is: If they can provide a sponsor we will issue them a cert, otherwise their VO is not registered and we cannot serve them and they should go talk to their VO about this.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Christiane: User's need to import into browsers. This will be a problem if they get a new computer.

<strong>Agenda:</strong>
<p />
Report out on RA and Grid Admin training from prior week <ul>
<li> Went well. Everyone was able to do everything, no problems with command-line tools. Very few had to use test domain.
</li> <li> Next steps on training <ul>
<li> Von and Ruth will iterate once on list of those missing and Ruth will email, pointing them at recorded.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
Current command-line client RPM (1.0.4) OK for next OSG software release? <ul>
<li> Any issues from GA training on Friday?
</li> <li> No, let's ship 1.0.4 RPM in next software release.
</li></ul> 
<p />
Update on ATLAS/Panda issue: <ul>
<li> <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249" target="_top">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-249</a>
</li> <li> We think Brian has a fix for <span class="twikiNewLink">GridSite<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/GridSite?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="GridSite (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>, has pushed into OSG RPM repository, so it will accept CA certificates in proxy file.
</li> <li> We really need this pushed to the Panda server at CERN, John H. is the only one able to update GGUS certificate.
</li> <li> <span class="twikiNewLink">OpenSSL<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/OpenSSL?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="OpenSSL (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> has different logic paths if CA certs come from client as opposed to trust root.
</li> <li> It seems to be a combination of CA certificates in proxy file and pathlen=0.
</li> <li> Next steps?
</li> <li> Either push fixes to CERN or try and replicate ourselves. Brian has put up gridsite server and tested his fix.
</li> <li> AI: Von to raise Brian's fix with Martin, include Rob to raise at WLCG Operations meeting.
</li> <li> AI: Jim to open ticket - Identify what in ATLAS workflow is adding certificates to proxies (email GOC)
</li> <li> AI: Ruth will open request regarding Panda server for testing.

</li> <li> John Hoover - a curl command is failing from ATLAS pilot; but when manually run from a BNL worker node; very strange as we think environment is the same.
</li> <li> Problem: executing from pilot, connecting to PANDA server, Apache + mod_gridsite; job dispatch step - pilot asks server for job payload; over https, called from pilot using curl; appears to be failing when run from Pilot using <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> proxy in batch mode
</li> <li> Seems to work OK with DOE Grids-derived proxy but error seems to occur with <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>-derived proxy

</li> <li> PANDA does a curl callback? No, always from WN to PANDA @ CERN.
</li> <li> Mine: We have a test PANDA server in ITB, why didn't we see the problem there? John doesn't think so. There is only one PANDA server in the world.
</li> <li> AI: Mine to check with Suchandra on how much ITB tested <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> with PANDA.

</li> <li> PANDA at CERN presumably uses a CERN CA-issued host certificate.
</li> <li> Suchandra: Does not have APS pilot set up. That means no ATLAS pilots were submitted with <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> certificate in ITB.

</li> <li> Contingency Plan - was presented at WLCG Management Board today. <ul>
<li> No major criticisms or tough questions. Got 3 questions, mainly clarifying.
</li> <li> One interesting question - DOE Grids is acting as WLCG catch all CA. Question arose if they is still needed and if so, should this be OSG PKI? Seems like they were leaning towards it not being needed, betters options (National CAs) have emerged, and then there is the CERN CA. This was anyone who didn't have certificates in WLCG. We think this was mainly for user certificates?

<li> Steve Timm asked to re-schedule one of the training schedules to not conflict with Ops calls (Mondays noon-1pm CT). We could move training to start at 1pm CT? If 3 hours seems sufficient for the first pair of sessions, then we'll start the second pair (or just RA session) an hour later. Expect we'll need more time for Grid Admin sessions. We note second Grid Admin session is a Friday so is not a conflict.
</li> <li> Had one participant who needed help getting registered with OIM. Would be useful to have directions on Indigo page. Mine will do this, asked Soichi to check what she does.
</li> <li> "PKI Staff" vs "PKI Super Staff": Only Alain gets notification on requests, we can create email lists. For training, trainers need "Super Privileges" for VOs and Domains to fix mistakes, etc. There is not a "root" account today. Trainers should email Soichi with list of VOs/domains they need to be RAs/GAs for training.     * On Monday, who would be useful to have "on call" in case of problems? Soichi and Alain D.     * Are we planning on recording on the training sessions? Yes, we are planning on doing this.     * Working on Soichi to check registrant list. Mine will contact people who are not registered.     * Jim working on getting existing OSG RA Agents to enroll.     * When are planning on closing registration? Right now closing on Thursday for Oct 1.

Other business: <ul>
<li> Next Monday is start of transition, when some subset of our community can expect to use the OSG PKI in production. What is needed for that to happen? <ul>
<li> Need for a user to tell if they can use OSG PKI. Need a list of VOs and domains that are ready.
</li> <li> Expectation is folks will request privileges in production system at end of training.
</li> <li> Follow up with Agents at the end of training to add them to list.
</li> <li> OSG, MIS, OSGEDU are ready today.

<li> ITB release happened this morning - relatively small list of changes, nothing major wrt PKI.
</li> <li> re OIM-ITB: normally sync ITB  with production OIM on every ITB release. Have been postponing. But really need to sync.
</li> <li> This seems to create complications with regards to training.
</li> <li> Plan B: Try to sync only specific parts (RSV-SAN)

<li> Nothing to report. Still working on email and domain.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi) <ul>
<li> Sep 11 production release today. Went well. Bugs opened in last couple weeks should have been fixed today. Search went live today, would like people to try.
</li> <li> ITB release will be 18th, this must have new features for next production release for 9/25 release. Bugs fixes can be made up until the 25th.
</li> <li> Should we make the certificate menu available to the public on the 25th? Should we be changing links to OIM Certificates? Yes and Yes.
</li> <li> Alain will get requests without a configured VO. He will be effectively a catch-all RA Agent. Need to be careful about the load here.
</li> <li> We can send just new users for OSG VO (2-4 users) per month to OIM.
</li> <li> Will leave default links for now, and re-visit this in mid-October when we have more VO RAs on board.

<li> Anthony: tested registering DC in VOMRS with no problems, gave same privs as DOE Grids, was able to approve other certificates. Just touched based with Rob S., encountered no issues with certificates. All CMS sites will be requesting host certificates from OSG/Digicert.
</li> <li> What is the workload? A few clicks on VOMS admin end. CMS users may get CERN certificate instead, they are in HR data base so it's just easy for them, so not expecting much workload.

Other business: <ul>
<li> DOE Labs RAs - own relationships with DOE Grids PKI <ul>
<li> Dhiva will be contacting these folks.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> When we do the PKI transition the vomses file (<a href="http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-package/vomses" target="_top">http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-package/vomses</a>) will need to updated and distributed with new VOMS DNs as the VOMS admins update their certificates. Without this update voms-proxy-inits could fail causing production issues. (Rob) <ul>
<li> vomses file distributed to all OSG installations - has address, DN, port # for all VOMS install.
</li> <li> voms-proxy-init uses these files. Distributed rarely because VOMS DN don't typically change.
</li> <li> Problem: distribution can take months for everyone to adopt.
</li> <li> Should we seek a technical solution? Push file more often?
</li> <li> Can we put multiple DNs in for each VOMS to anticipate change? AI: Rob will do this. Not sure if this solves the problem.
</li> <li> How many people use voms-proxy-init? FNAL services require it. We don't know how often it is used beyond that.
</li> <li> Rob will bring up at production call.
</li> <li> We will take this up next week.

<li> <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan" target="_top">https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan</a>
</li> <li> Goals are to bring RAA and GA up to speed on OIM and Policies.
</li> <li> Big policy change is how RAA/GA responsibilities are divided.
</li> <li> Will also have new agents.
</li> <li> Will use ITB instance; that way they don't have to be fully approved, but in ITB. Will need registration process (with domains). Will go through process of requesting, approving, revoking.
</li> <li> GA includes commandline tools as well.
</li> <li> Should we cover osg-gridadmin-manage? No.
</li> <li> Use Indico for training registration? OIM has no such option.
</li> <li> Use <span class="twikiNewLink">AdobeConnect<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/AdobeConnect?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="AdobeConnect (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>.

</li> <li> Do we need training for Sponsors? Have we done this before? No
</li> <li> How much lead time do we need for registration in OIM-ITB? It's quick in OIM. Get a week lead time for domain registration.
</li> <li> Who will lead and participate in each training session? It would be helpful for Soichi, Alain D. and Von involved. Reasonable for Von and Alain.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Decision: Whenever we can, we will encourage people to use the OSG PKI when technically feasible.

<li> Sent to ET last Friday, have heard no feedback yet.
</li> <li> Chander has read - 2 Qs: Do you know of any other major team that has put a contingency plan for a PKI in place? How much resortation can we accomplish by restoring a fraction of the users certificates - is that a reasonable strategy? Fill follow up with Mine on Thursday.
</li> <li> Mine contacted CERN CA (back in June) - they don't have a contingency plan, as they think they have enough redundancy place to recovery quickly (in 1-2 weeks). FNAL KCA has similar thoughts.

<li> John Volmer: Requesting multiple personal certificates onto desktop. Interface seems require a unique email address for each certificate request. <ul>
<li> Approaching OIM anonymous, always requires unique email address. So one is required to authenticate with cert in browser to obtain multiple certificates?
</li> <li> Is this what we want? This is not the way things have worked before.
</li> <li> Users may not load certificates into browsers otherwise.
</li> <li> What should a user do if they run into this?
</li> <li> AI: We need to either change this behavior or provide guidance to user how to deal with this.
</li> <li> E.g., user requesting certificate before certificates expired.

Attending: Tony, Chander, Greg, Alan D., Von, Mine, Rohan, Alain R.
<p />
Agenda: <ul>
<li> Command-line tool updates (Rohan) <ul>
<li> Tony confused by purpose of command-line tools. Expecting ability to request a single hostname without separate approval step. Found names confusing, suggests dropping 'multi'
</li> <li> Asked about how to issue service certificates - should be able to specify <svc>/<fqdn>, but it seems to be broken at the moment: <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-93" target="_top">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-93</a>

<li> PENDING
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Greg update on Roadmap - August 22nd at latest, client revocation code will be live. <ul>
<li> Can we get documentation head of time? Yes, Greg.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Contingency Analysis (Mine)
</li> <li> Deadline for revocation API (Soichi not on call, discussion off-line)
</li> <li> What is motivation for python 2.4 support? RHEL5 which common, also Scientific Linux 5 <ul>
<li> Rohan and Von both using macs which doesn't play well with Python 2.4 - can we get access to a RHEL5 machine
</li> <li> <span class="twikiNewLink">FermiCloud<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/FermiCloud?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="FermiCloud (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> is one option, or Alain has some old hosts, or use a VM. <span class="twikiNewLink">FermiCloud<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/FermiCloud?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="FermiCloud (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> would allow direct testing of RPMs. Alain would supply link for Fermi account, then talk to Steve T.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Packing of CLI tools <ul>
<li> Goals: RPMs - RHEL5 &amp; variants, RHEL6 &amp; varients, Scientific Linux is the most common variant. OSG SW3 is all RPM-based.
</li> <li> What else do we want to support? Older release is OSG 1.2. That version is not RPM - it is all <span class="twikiNewLink">PacMan<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/PacMan?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="PacMan (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>. Have told people we are not doing updates, ship updates rarely. Do we want to provide a 1.2 release as well? For <span class="twikiNewLink">PacMan<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/PacMan?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="PacMan (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> need a usable tarball - what is a usable tarball? <span class="twikiNewLink">M2Crypto<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/M2Crypto?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="M2Crypto (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> is already an RPM, but is extra effort for <span class="twikiNewLink">PacMan<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/PacMan?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="PacMan (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>.
</li> <li> Would need tarball for CLI clients, and then tarball for <span class="twikiNewLink">M2Crypto<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/M2Crypto?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="M2Crypto (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>. Also SWIG is needed.
</li> <li> Nothing we described doesn't sound like something Alain
</li> <li> Can we decide not do do 1.2 packaging? Anthony says CMS would be fine without 1.2 packages.
</li> <li> There may also be other machines  - non-RPM, non-PacMan. Could just point them at source repository? RPM gets us 90%.
</li> <li> There is also always the Web Interface, between it and the source repo, it seems to be covered.
</li> <li> DECISION: We will be doing RPM only until someone complaints.
</li> <li> Two possible issues for packaging - configuration file shared and one python file imported by all scripts. Both are static. Configuration file should be looked for in standard places and same with python files.
</li> <li> We do not need to patch m2crypto any more.
</li> <li> Alain will drive packaging.
</li> <li> ACTION ITEM: Would like 'make dist' that creates versioned tarball.
</li> <li> Does RPM contain both new and DOE Grids scripts? Yes is the decision.
</li> <li> ACTION ITEM: We should settle names before packaging.
</li> <li> ACTION ITEM: Script should look in /etc/ and ./ for configuration file (maybe /etc/osg/)
</li> <li> What should script find module? we will use PYTHONPATH

</li> <li> Just focusing OIM, will do with client tools later
</li> <li> Section 2, MUSTS: <ol>
<li> All GOC software is Apache v2 <ul>
<li> Should make sure this is stated somewhere in the source code.
</li> <li> Goal here is that OSG has access to software if IU leaves consortium
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Version scheme: protocol has a version
</li> <li> Test suite: Have a few unit tests, not comprehensive. Access control requirements makes testing hard. Most testing is 'friendly user' testing. <ul>
<li> Have a testing period on ITB is acceptable.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> End-user documentation: in the case of OIM this is the web pages itself
</li> <li> Internal developer documentation: <ul>
<li> This is a bigger concern, how would a second developer come up to speed? How is it build and deployed?
</li> <li> Alex D. has been added to OIM development
</li> <li> We have: <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/vonwelch.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit#" target="_top">https://docs.google.com/a/vonwelch.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit#</a>
</li> <li> Result: some work need to be done here to document built processes.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Source code repository with versioning scheme: use subversion, branch every release
</li> <li> External code review: <ul>
<li> This is more applicable to CLI, since SW team will be taking this over.
</li> <li> We don't have expertise to do this for OIM (javascript, other web technologies) on OSG SW team.
</li> <li> Should we do webapp testing for OIM? We should at least do low-hanging fruit. OWASP.
</li> <li> MIST is an option, but would need to be resourced.
</li> <li> What about GUMS, VOMRS developers? Doesn't seem likely they have spare cycles.
</li> <li> Alain is fine with state of affairs here for OIM.
</li></ul> 
</li>  </ol><ul>
<li> With exception of completing documentation for item 5, Alain is happy with section 2.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Section 2, SHOULDS: <ol>
<li> Use community software: Not applicable.
</li> <li> Widely-known technologies: Acceptable

<li> AI: Is there off-site (non-Bton data center) backup?
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> 5.1.2: Protection from modification: is protected by usual mysql access controls and unix file system permissions. Access limited to GOC staff and limited by bastion host. Back ups provide extra protection.
</li> <li> 5.1.3: Any changes to auditing will be logged: no applicable, all database changes are logged.
</li> <li> 5.1.4: Any attempt to modify logs will be logged:  all database changes are logged.

</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Section 6: Authentication <ul>
<li> 6.1: Failed authentication attempts will be logged: We do certificate-based authentication, handled by Apache. Apache logs failures. We don't currently monitor.

We currently accept any IGTF certificate for OIM. We don't currently enforce the use of a specific CA for TA. <ul>
<li> TA role is bound to contact Id, one can map multiple certificates contact ID. We could implement TA as an authorization and force binding to a DN.
</li> <li> AI: Do we need to limit Trusted Agents to use of <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> certificates?
</li> <li> AI: Under the old system, reach TA/GA had to renew their rights each year with certificate renewal. Was this purposeful?
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Section 7: <ul>
<li> We don't currently have a defined process for this for the OSG CA. Should define a process where all of this is logged as a ticket, which becomes the audit record.
</li> <li> AI: Define this process.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Section 8: <ul>
<li> 8.1.1: We have 3 limits - global for the entire OSG for year, user has an annual limit (3 user certificates, 1000 host certificates) , user has a daily limit for host certificates (50); these are administratively adjustable.
</li> <li> 8.1.2: Track and notify when certain levels are reached: <ul>
<li> Have Munin plug-in to monitor number of requests: <a href="https://internal.grid.iu.edu/munin/ITB_VMs/oim-itb/cert_quota.html" target="_top">https://internal.grid.iu.edu/munin/ITB_VMs/oim-itb/cert_quota.html</a> URL here.
</li> <li> 75% of threshold, 85% is critical and sends warnings on these levels.
</li> <li> Multiple thresholds are problematic.
</li> <li> AI: Change warning to 50%, critical to 75%.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> 8.1.3: No longer a requirement. See <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-69" target="_top">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-69</a>
</li> <li> 8.1.4: See 8.1.1
</li> <li> 8.1.5: See 8.1.1
</li> <li> 8.2.1: Host Certificate Approvers of host certificates shall be Grid Admins: Implemented
</li> <li> 8.2.2: GA shall be restricted to a domain: Confirmed
</li> <li> 8.3.1: User email addresses must be in <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>. <ul>
<li> AI: Need to add checking of user's email domain.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> 9.1: Private key generation logging: Von will verify this when he verifies logging for item 5. <ul>
<li> This is not explicit, private key is created when certificate generated, and when session expires.
</li> <li> Want to be able to answer question: what keys were on the system during a given time frame?
</li> <li> Private key deletion is tied to session expiration - is this logged? Not currently, but can be turned on.
</li> <li> AI: Private key deletion should be implicitly or explicitly logged? Can we overwrite private key with noise? Or are we at mercy of GC?
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> 9.2: Private keys encrypted with strength-tested pass phrase: Done.
</li> <li> Section 10: Host certificate revocation works today, user certificate revocation is pending support from <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>.

<li> Waiting on results from bulk-host testing. Requests have been put into dev-team.
</li> <li> We can get peek at their roadmap when it is sorted out.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Update from Jeremy on command-line scripts. <ul>
<li> Sent out invitation to list to test CLI scripts. They are not packaged currently. Just check it out of subversion. There is a README and each script has '-h' option.
</li> <li> Packaging might be a day's work, Rohan will contact Alain when ready.
</li> <li> Please send issues to list or start a JIRA issue.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Update from Soichi on front-end and testing, bulk-host certificate request. <ul>
<li> Updated registration process email - turning into a complicated process - dealing with a lot of corner cases (e.g. expired certificate, so unauthenticated, but has DN)
</li> <li> AI: Von to look at updated chart.
</li> <li> Have something slow for bulk-host, expect to improve it with better API.
</li> <li> Digicert doesn't have a clean way to get status on a requested certificate. We wait for 60 seconds, then every 5 seconds ask for a host certificate.
</li> <li> AI: Soichi create document with use case, what he is doing today, and what is.
</li> <li> Will be gone next week.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Discussion of duplicate host certificate issuance (email exchange with Anthony) <ul>
<li> Von describes his proposal that host certificates have to be expiring or revoked to be reissued.
</li> <li> Anthony needs a grace period for changing over expired certificates. One month sounds reasonable. T1 is very concerned about downtime because they are contractually obligated.
</li> <li> Jim &amp; Mine: concerned about disaster planning - need to encourage some overlap of certificates.
</li> <li> Soichi: Already have three limits (day, user, total) - do we need another limit?
</li> <li> Alain: Should we handle these a exceptions rather than policy.
</li> <li> Von agrees not to bake this into policy.
</li></ul>

New Action Items: <ul>
<li> Sort out renewal (???)
</li></ul> 
<p />
Notes: <ul>
<li> Host certificate signing delays - Greg - had some configuration issues, has been fixed to threshold of a minute. Also discovered that our setting for batch certificates is hitting them every 5 seconds, which is putting a strain on their servers. Can we make requests about a particular certificate every ~30 seconds. <ul>
<li> We need get Soichi to make changes on our side and then Jeremy. 
</li> <li> Soichi: We send up 50 cert requests, then start pinging. We are talking here the querying about certificates once requested.
</li> <li> Can we have a API call to request all the status at once?
</li> <li> What is the paradigm that DC would like it to use?
</li> <li> Can we wait 60 second before we make the first request? Then they should all be issued.
</li> <li> Is this a server dedicated to OSG? No. What will be the impact of other customers on our requests?
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> No other updates on other items, first one consumed all the time.
</li> <li> OIM-ITB is available for testing, Alex Sim has been testing and Soichi has been fixing a bunch of issues that he released just before the call. <ul>
<li> Any unresolved complaints at this point? Certificate renewal is unclear.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Jim has looked at Transition testing, will be blocked until a production OIM certificate front end is available.

</li> <li>  Soichi to consider implications of possible delay in host certificate issuance and implications to design. <ul>
<li> Added new API call "issue()"  - should be called until it returns success.
</li> <li> For Web UI, requestor precess "Issue" which then waits certificate issuance and then user can "download."

</li> <li> AI: Soichi to think about.     * Revocation for user certificates - API doesn't support client cert through API? Jeremy says it worked. We're confused here.

<p />
Agenda: <ul>
<li> Focused development discussion
</li></ul> 
<p />
Notes: <ul>
<li> Soichi has prototype already at OIM-ITB
</li> <li> We will plan on doing a iterative testing model with OIM-ITB and code that is available frequently to members of OSG-PKI email list (and others who are interested).
</li> <li> What is the relationship between software team and new PKI software? <ul>
<li> OIM is not packaged or distributed - is available under Apache license from IU SVN - not public, but that's historical not by policy
</li> <li> There is precent for other services like this in OSG - e.g. RSL
</li> <li> General decision regarding OIM is that it stays where it is at, but SW Team has a role in ensuring it's quality.
</li> <li> Client tools are more clear - will be owned by SW team and replace DOE Grids tools in VDT. <ul>
<li> There is an issue here of long-term support to work out.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> During testing we will be using <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> Pilot CA, don't need to use full set of policies - do need someone to act as RA/GA - Von will as Alain D. to do so. <ul>
<li> At some point we need to shift to full policies - at Deployment?
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Soichi and Jeremy will announce on OSG-PKI list where software/services are available for testining. <ul>
<li> Software for testing may be very raw - e.g. not have packaging for client software, testers expected to do 'svn co'
</li> <li> Soichi and Jeremy should make it clear what is expected to work.
</li> <li> Feedback may not be addressed immediately depending on prioritization - developing other features may be first.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Next major milestone is July 20th, Acceptance testining <ul>
<li> Expectation is software is functionally complete per Acceptance Plan
</li> <li> May not have all the polish and user friendliness at that point
</li> <li> We will arrange meeting with Von, Alain R. and developers to review software per plan

<li> Why not register user in OIM as soon we get the user's contact information? Do we need to make sure the user gets their certificate first?
</li> <li> Renewal - don't revoke old certificate on renewal.

<li> Good Use Cases and Feature Matrix
</li> <li> Von went through and commented on, topics to discuss: <ul>
<li> Sponsors <ul>
<li> Alain D: VO-manager will provide list of Sponsors for VO, most of the time. Sponsors not formally agreeing to something. They preferably have a DOE Grids Cert. An non-user can act as a sponsor, if need be.   
</li> <li> Sponsors do not have authority to issue certificates. 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Un-checked Grid Admin requests - concerns Von re typo on CLI app <ul>
<li> Tony: GA must create a file with N hostnames.
</li> <li>  Alain R: Has made a mistake with N wrong hostnames.
</li> <li> Tony: This is part of what the 50 cert/day limit enforced - would spread requests out over multiple days. 
</li> <li> Decision: Carry the 50 cert/day limit forward.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Notes: <ul>
<li> In-browser vs In-server key generation.
</li> <li> Jim: has had an extensive discussion with TAGPMA in CILogon, they were OK with it, so far users seem to like it. No bad experiences so far.
</li> <li> In-browser was number 1 complaint at March'12 AHM.

</li> <li> Users must sign AUP in VOMRS every year, so pre-populating won't save users from visiting VOMRS; will save VOMS admin from approving new DN.
</li> <li> Anthony: pre-populating doesn't buy him anything.
</li> <li> Pre-population not a clear win over manual approval, especially given re-vetting is required.
</li> <li> Any VOs besides ATLAS and CMS we need to consider? GLOW has 12-20 users, would be more work, Engage has 70 users.
</li> <li> Housecleaning is benefit of manually.
</li> <li> Decision: We will do manual revetting at VOMS.
</li> <li> <strong>Action Item</strong>: Jim will write up pan for manual method (add DN to existing VOMS account).
</li> <li> Still see much value in GUMS supporting multiple users - expect both DNs to be in system for jobs in flight, and data access (CMS T1 do DN-&gt;userid mapping).

</li> <li> Design discussion report out (Von) <ul>
<li> Soichi, Jeremy, Von
</li> <li> Users may legitimately have multiple certificates(?) - impacts duplicate detection.        * Rob Q. confirms - users in multiple VOs.
</li> <li> Change: RA agents will not be able to approve Host/Svc certificates <ul>
<li> Alex: Not going to be easy to have representatives from each domain, allow for delegation from authority.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Client-side authn for host scripts? No - Do we want CLI for anything besides host certificates - No. <ul>
<li> Scripts currently ask for a personal certificate before generating CSR
</li> <li> cert-grid-admin - from OSG distribution, does authentication
</li> <li> then is another set of scripts that doesn't do authentication - cert-request.
</li> <li> Jeremy's script is called - will report.
</li> <li> Site admin may submit requests - and then Grid Admin must approve
</li> <li> Most of the time Site Admins are also Grid Admins, in that case an authenticated request from a Grid Admin does not need subsequent approval.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Matrix of supported features <ul>
<li> This is in the system design doc: OIM Certificate Management System Design
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Every request has to be approved by an RA Agent or Grid Admin <ul>
<li> And not automated.     * If we're going to have a CLI to generate a CSR, why not just have it do submission, why bring a web browser into it at all?     * What are the packaging assumptions on what users have installed?        * Table this for when Alain R.

AI: Jim and Von to talk to WLCG VOMS admins to determine policies on pre-loading.
<p />
AI: Von and Chander to group tasks to match project plan <ul>
<li> Spend a few minutes on the technical plan - figure out what is high priority (needed by other parts)
</li> <li> Can we knock of the REST API design, as that seems simpler.

</li> <li> Von asks: I suspect we'll be in a world with inconsistent GUMS deployment, can we handle that?
</li> <li> Alain: OSG 1.0 hasn't been supported in over a year and there are still a handful of sites running this.
</li> <li> It takes a long time to get everyone to upgrade.
</li> <li> Suspects a lot of sites will be willing to upgrade, still it will take months. LHC sites in production will be reluctant. Will need to think about how to make it as easy as possible.
</li> <li> Not sure there has been a non-security issue where software was pushed hard.
</li> <li> Believe we've done that with Gratia?
</li> <li> Will using the old GUMS with multiple DNs break things? We don't know. This will probably cause problems.
</li> <li> Can we have multiple VOMS accounts? One per DN
</li> <li> They are not equivalent.
</li> <li> Downside to "manual changeover" - GUMS queries VOMS 4x/day - so there is a lag
</li> <li> Tony: if you talk to CMS and ATLAS, they use VOMS in WLCG; not a big issue for CMS, they can update GUMS responsively.
</li> <li> Unit of transition is individual.
</li> <li> Having jobs in flight using proxies requires multiple DNs in VOMs.
</li> <li> Tony: suspect we need a 1-2 month window to get sites to upgrade. We think this is relatively easy for the 80% of LHC.
</li> <li> Option (A): everyone updates GUMS, add new DNs to existing VOMS accounts, nice and smooth
</li> <li> Option (B): add new VOMS accounts with new DNs in advance, existing account mappings could be broken - would need to explore specific account mappings
</li> <li> Option (C): once user gets their <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> certificate, they need to go to VOMS-Admin, VOMRS and register their new DN. May also require manual operation by VOMS administration, will require approval (Tony: yes, it will require approval).
</li> <li> Tony: Don't know we can get WLCG to pre-populate pre-existing DNs
</li> <li> Have VOs pick the option they desire? Can this be per-VOs choice?
</li> <li> Who is WLCG POC? Marty Pena (Tony will send me contact information) for CMS VOMS server.
</li> <li> Could put a temporary OSG VOMS server?

</li> <li> Question about Sponsor registration - required?

Then Jim was able to do Von and Mine.
</li> <li> How will this relate to our <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span>?
</li> <li> Would prefer signed email and shorter agreement.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> DN change plans (Jim B.) <ul>
<li> Take advantage of new feature in GUMS where we can associate multiple DNs with users
</li> <li> If we can predict <span class="twikiNewLink">DigiCert<a href="/bin/edit/Operations/DigiCert?topicparent=Operations.OSGPKITransitionCallNotes2012" rel="nofollow" title="DigiCert (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> DNs, then we can load those into GUMS ahead of time
</li> <li> Puts a strong dependency for us on new GUMS work - John Hoover is spreadheading this.
</li> <li> AI: Jim to ping John (and Alain R.) let them know about our dependency, ask for updates, and ask for current timeline.

</li> <li> In general seems like we should just undertake doing these things.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Design updates (Jeremy) <ul>
<li> High-level design - initial version by 3/23, final version by 3/30: This is a short 2-3 document giving the high-level components of the front end, and also discussing any other components we will be producing (e.g., a new bulk host request script). The major thing this document will do is lay out the big decisions in terms of what software we'll leverage, e.g., OIM, or what is undecided, e.g. we'll need some library here to do REST calls. The initial version gets circulate for comment and then finalized by 3/30.
</li> <li> Components designs - initial versions by 4/17, finalized by 5/1. For each component, a ~4 page document describing what it will do, what it's requirements are, what it will interact with, and how we'll go about about developing it. Initial versions by 4/17 gives two weeks for comments and discussions and finalized by the 5/1 end of the planning phase. My expectation is we'd follow a MVC approach, so would have documents for the GUI, the database, and the controller logic (which would perhaps include interacting with DC or perhaps that would be another component), plus a document on the client script changes.
</li> <li> Almost got basic design document done, included Soichi work, plans to send to list tomorrow or Thursday. 40k ft view.
</li> <li> AI: Von and Soichi to review when it comes out.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Discussion of key generation options - user vs OSG (Soichi) <ul>
<li> <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-3" target="_top">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-3</a>
</li> <li> DOE Grids site used browser generation of key pair, this create some support problems
</li> <li> Three ways to generate keys: (1) in browser (via Javascript or HTML5); (2) command line and paste CSR; (3) in the server
</li> <li> IE not going to support HTML5
</li> <li> Proposal is to support server-side generation.
</li> <li> Bulk-host certificate request: limits on request and per-day
</li> <li> Von's proposal is we support sever-side key generation for user certificates, with CSR-pasting as a secondary option.
</li> <li> Soichi says adding CSR-form isn't much work
</li> <li> Host certs are done primarily from the command-line today.
</li> <li> Do we need a web interface at all for host certificates? Sites with small number of hosts.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> OSG RA/Grid Admin training plan (Mine/Von) <ul>
<li> Mine not on call, Von to follow up off-list
