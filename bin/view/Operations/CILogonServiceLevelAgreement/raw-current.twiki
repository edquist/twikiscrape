---++ Executive Summary

The CILogon project provides the open source, standards-based *CILogon Service* at [[https://cilogon.org/][https://cilogon.org/]], providing the NSF research community with credentials for secure access to cyberinfrastructure (CI). The service bridges the identity credentials generated by the nation’s universities, through the [[http://www.incommonfederation.org/][InCommon Federation]], to a certificate for authentication to NSF’s cyberinfrastructure projects.
---++ Owners

This SLA is owned by OSG and XSEDE and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the XSEDE Senior Management Team and the OSG Executive Team.

---++ Service Name and Description

---+++ !!Name

The CILogon Service

---+++ !!Description

The CILogon Service provides the certificate signing backend for CILogon Open Science Grid Certification Authority [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/OSGCertificateService][CILogon OSG CA]]. OSG OIM interface was integrated with CILogon Hardware Security Module (CILogon HSM) resulting in the new CILogon OSG CA, which is operated by OSG in collaboration with XSEDE. Certificates from this CA are only issued issued if user/host/service certificate request has been approved by the Registration Authority Agent (RA) and/or Grid Admin (as the case may be).

The CILogon Service also provides CILogon Basic CA. The CILogon Basic CA is a service that allows users at universities with existing single sign-on systems to use their campus credentials to get a certificate issued by the CILogon Basic CA instantly. This certificate is only issued if the campus single sign-on system verifies the user’s credentials. OSG is a relying party of CILogon Basic CA. Users from some research institutions and universities -which are members of OSG- get certificates from CILogon Basic CA using their institutions credentials.

---++ Security Considerations

   * Unavailability of the CILogon Service: certificate signing backend for CILogon OSG CA or CILogon Basic CA does not constitute a security incident. 
   * Compromise of the certificate signing backend (offered by CILogon Service) for CILogon OSG CA constitutes a declared security incident at OSG and XSEDE. 
   * Compromise of the CILogon Basic CA constitutes a declared security incident only at XSEDE. 
   * Incident control in the case of compromise of the CILogon Service will fall to the XSEDE L3 Operations Security lead(s). 
      * For CILogon certificate signing backend, see Section 5.7. Compromise and disaster recovery at CILogon OSG CA Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (CP/CPS) [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Security/OSGCertificateService/CILogonOSGCPCPS_Final_V1.pdf][here]] for incident management and response procedures.
      * For CILogon Basic CA, see Section 5.7 Compromise and disaster recovery at CILogon Basic CA Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (CP/CPS) [[http://ca.cilogon.org/cilogon-basic-policy.pdf?revision=4][here]] for incident management and response procedures.

---++ Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times
