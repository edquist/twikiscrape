---++++ Grid Operations Center
   * Problems issuing host certs: [[https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/26756][26756]], [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/26744][26744]]
      * !DigiCert contacted, they have responded but do not have an answer at this time.
      * Problem may have been transient, a re-try worked.
   * Problems editing !TWiki pages
      * traced to filling /tmp, leftover .pdf and .html files generated by baidu crawl.
      * mechanisms in place to prevent recurrence. 

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Working with VOs to help debug glideinWMS v3_2_11 on GOC-ITB
   * Discovered GOC was pulling globus from epel repo rather than osg repo.
      * Marty rolled back GOC software 9/9, factory was down for 1 hour, but everything came back up smoothly
      * Impact: OSG VO was unable to submit glideins to some globus resources, but SDSC factory was able to serve the sites that GOC couldn&#39;t
      * Scott created goc ticket for us to discuss preventing this from happening on future GOC updates when Tom gets back:
