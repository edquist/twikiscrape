   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2010January11][Previous Meeting Agenda]]
   * Last week&#39;s availability metrics
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yek7kob][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]] - NOTE: High Level OSG Display added to monitoring per Brian Bockelman&#39;s request, SLA expected soon.
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ybp3w7z][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-12.html][Production release Tuesday - Jan 12th 14:00 UTC]]* complete
   * Relevant to only WLCG Interop sites: SAM team indicated a couple more instances of a broker problem; GOC resent RSV records, and SAM team agreed to recompute numbers. We&#39;ve been working on an MOU as we&#39;ve had to resend records a few times as related to outages. We&#39;ve been discussing monitoring WLCG services directly. Burt has expressed CMS support for this.
   * GOC/Parag, et al. continued to pursue the case of [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7913][some CEs stopping to upload data to central collector]] - CEMon developers have agreed to release patch to CEMon client (that is installed on OSG CEs) that will cause each subscription to run in its own thread even if their frequencies are identical. A temporary workaround is to change the publishing times, be careful that you don&#39;t overwrite when you run configure-osg.
   * GOC CEMon testing was resoundingly successful for Rob, only seeing 37 failures in 80200 tests.
      * GOC has [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7978][added is2 back into DNS RR]] for is.grid.iu.edu
