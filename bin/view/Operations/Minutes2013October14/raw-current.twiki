---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

---++ Security
no new major incidents or major vulnerabilities this week, although Red Hat did issue several minor security fixes people might want to keep an eye out, like jboss, php53, and a new kernel. I believe the kernel issue was another DOS vulnerability.

---++ AOB

---++ Action Items from Meeting
   * Scott and Steve will set up a meeting tomorrow to discuss technical issues regarding GOC as backup to !FermiGrid operated services
