---++ WLCG Ops

---++ Security
   * moderate sudo security issue for red hat https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1149.html
   * The fix for this vulnerability introduced a problem with the rpm install script, such that if the file /etc/nsswitch.conf had been previously modified, then when the rpm is installed the permissions are incorrectly reset to 600. This problem particularly affects systems using nis. If a problem is reported after installing the updated sudo rpm, the permissions on /etc/nsswitch.conf should be checked, and reset to 644 if necessary. A fixed rpm was released by Red Hat, however as of Tuesday (8/21) morning it is still in the Fastbugs repo from Scientific Linux.
