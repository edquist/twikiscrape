   * The ITB and Production databases are shared and there was a slowdown due to an itb site in Columbia that dumped all of their unknown VO data. This is believed to be recovered.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Campus wide network outage at UCSD Tues April 19 5:45 pm to about 7:30 pm (pacific).
      * Believed to be caused by damaged fiber optic connection connecting campus to WAN
      * During this time the Factory was unreachable by off-campus Frontends
      * Igor notified Frontend admins with his FNAL email (UCSD mail servers were unreachable as well)
      * Did not affect running glideins for off-campus Frontends, only prevented new ones from starting in this time period
      * CMS glideins failed however since glideins could not reach the CMS Frontend at UCSD

---++ Operations This Week
