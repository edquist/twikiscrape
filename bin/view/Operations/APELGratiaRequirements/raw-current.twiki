---+ Requirements for APEL(EGI)-Gratia(OSG) Reporting of International VOs

---+++Introduction

Many OSG VOs are international in scope and use resources across the EU/EGI and US/OSG infrastructure. 

---+++ Requirements

The requirement is for these VOs  to see complete information about their resource usage across both infrastructures. This can be done by a layer that collects the information from both  EGI APEL and OSG Gratia or by transferring data between the two systems such that, with the appropriate queries, information from both infrastructures is available.

In the spirit of &quot;federation&quot; each VO can choose which system they look at the complete information through. For example, D0 and SBGrid  would look at Gratia and ILC has requested to look through APEL. 

When information is gathered to the OSG side it needs to be clear in our plots what is EGI - or other infrastructure - usage and which is on OSG resources. 

---+++ Notes

A separate repository for data transferred from APEL to Gratia may be necessary. This would need to include both a data collector, database and reporting UI.
