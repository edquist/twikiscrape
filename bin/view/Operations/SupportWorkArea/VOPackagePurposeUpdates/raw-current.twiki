---++ Introduction and Goal

The OSG VO Package is a set of files maintained and distributed by the GOC. They configure OSG resources to gather VO user data from VOMS and GUMS services. They also allow users to get VOMS verified proxies from their VOs VOMS service.  

This document will outline the components of the VO Package in a broad overview, as well as, provide the links for detailed information of each component. Additionally, this document will provide the links necessary for a GOC Staff member to update the VO Package.


---++ Description

The VO Package consists of 3 files. 

   * *edg-mkgridmap.config:* is a gatekeeper tool which runs periodically via cron. It contacts a list of VOMS servers, specified by the admin. It assembles a list of users from those servers and creates a grid-mapfile on the CE. This grid-mapfile serves both as a list of authorized users and provides a mapping from user names to local user IDs.

   * *gums.template:* Provides a centralized way for each Virtual Organization to share their VO groupMapping information across OSG.

   * *vomses:* This file contains the user name, voms address, port number, and DN for each VO’s voms. The vomses file provides contact information for obtaining verified certificate proxies. 

---++ Methods and Findings

   * Gaining understanding on this topic and process required researching various Twiki documents, gathering information from some of the VO’s websites and interviewing the primary person who maintains the VO-Package currently, Rob Quick. In the future this process should be able to be done by any OSG Operations Support member at the time of ticket creation. 

   * Given that Rob was readily available, interviewing him was the first logical choice. He gave me a brief overview of the VO-Package and its components. From there I began researching each of the components. I started by looking at each component where the vo-package resides, at GitHub.

   * After examining the information found on GitHub. I proceeded to research each component on the Twiki. This led me to branch off to various other sites eventually leading me to what I have attained now.

   * The new VO Package Update procedures can be found at [[Operations/GithubVOPackageUpdate][Update Procedures]]
