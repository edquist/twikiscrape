---+++ Other issues

1. Fermilab/USCMS &lt;-&gt; GOC ticket exchange

Tony at Fermilab has been working on Remedy (Fermilab/USCMS) &lt;-&gt; Footprints (GOC) ticket exchange. One scenario where a ticket in Remedy could be orphaned from a Footprints ticket. If &quot;Is this ticket ready to be closed?&quot; is not set to &quot;Yes&quot; the FP ticket is resolved, but the Remedy ticket is not. A future meeting will be scheduled so that the ticket exchange can be configured for greater efficiency.

- *Nothing new. A meeting is pending, but likely not until after the 0.8.0 release.*
