---++ 28 May 2013

NOTE: This will be our last call. After today, please use Production Call: https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes

Attending: Von, Kevin, Chander, Alain, Rob, Tony, Mine, Soichi

Agenda:
   * Update on Web UI (Soichi)
      * Release date - went well, minor issue with check-config(?).
      * Added functionality to send out warning and close tickets for requestes approved but never issues.
      * Re-enable restricted to prevent user from user certificate request if another request with exact same DN exists. Was in place before, disabled due to issues, but those have been fixed.
      * Next update - will allow GOC to start issuing certificates in SHA-2. Will not flip switch until Security Team requests transition to SHA-2. Question about which SHA-2 algorithm specifically? Tested with SHA-256.
      * Mine - MPKI just offers &quot;SHA-2&quot; will check precisely what that is.
   * Mine: Will be on maternity leave, has added Kevin as Admin in DigiCert&#39;s MPKI so he can get those certificates as well.
   * Soichi: Q about call moving to Operations - Soichi is not on Ops call every time - how should he raise items?
      * Rob: Plan to attend Ops calls for next Month. We will monitor interaction and then after June we will decide if Soichi needs to continue attending.
   * Unavailability of PKI due to maintenance (Von)
      * I&#39;d like to understand what happened and if it was communicated to user community properly.
      * https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/15312
      * Every other Tues (2nd &amp; 4th Tuesdays), there is risk of OIM/PKI being unavailable (particularly on 4th Tuesday).
      * OIM is a single instance (not HA).
      * Should be listed in advisory notice that goes our prior week (which is common).
      * Suggestion: Have a notice on OIM/PKI alerting people that PKI may be unavailable on 2nd and 4th Tuesday morning. Alain has ToDo to give Soichi wording to put on OIM.
   * Other business?

      * Submitter has not downloaded certificate after approval granted. Report shows some are 60-80 days old.
      * Planning on going with 30 day maximum (after approval). Then the request would get canceled out by Alain. User would have to re-submit a request.
      * Should OIM do this automatically? OK, if we make one final notification of user.
      * No dissent. Soichi will create ticket and implement.

      * Seeing a consistent set of tickets with users asking for OSG cert, FNAL service desk redirecting to CERN as per CMS policy.
      * Email from DOE Grids PKI reminder email is telling them to go to OSG. Can we ask DOE Grids to add text regarding CMS users.
      * Mine will contact Dhiva about this.
   * SHA-2 Readiness (Mine)
      * https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/Sha2Support
      * May have effect on OIM software, corner cases with transitioning from SHA-1 to SHA-2.
      * Soichi will start doing some testing. Doesn&#39;t expect any issues.

---++ 30 Apr 2013

---++ 23 Apr 2013

No call.

---++ 16 Apr 2013

NOTE: No call 4/23 or 4/30 due to Welch travel and vacation. Next call will be May 7th.

Attending: Rob, Von, Chander, Alain, Soichi, Kevin, Tony, John V.

New Action Items:
   * AI: Soichi to draft notification to RAs about re-renwal feature and the ability for users to request multiple host certificate through the web form.
   * AI: Von to write up plan for Primary Sponsor to be default.

Action Items:
   * AI: Alain to document process for RAs to accept user-provided sponsors (DONE)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/NewOSGPKI#Accepting_user_provided_sponsors
   * Action Item: Von and Soichi to compose email to DigiCert regarding communication improvements we would like. [DONE]
   * Action Item: Soichi out another notification telling people that certificate services are available. [DONE]
   * Action Item: Soichi will circulate document for feedback with regards to &quot;renewal&quot; of expired certificates. [DONE, see agenda.] 

Agenda:
   * Implementing user certificate re-request capability
      * https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/display/CHANGE/Implementing+user+certificate+RE-request+capability
      * Expired certificate or canceled request, allows user to &quot;re-request&quot; the certificate.
      * Avoids the &quot;email taken&quot; or &quot;DN already taken&quot; problems
      * Just released to OIM-ITB, implements document. 
      * AI: Soichi to draft notification to RAs about this feature.
   * UI changes:
      * After next weeks, we will be enforcing RSA key size on the front end (2048bits) as enforced by DigiCert.
      * Capability to have more than one CSR in web form for host certificate starting next week.
   * Rob: Question from Steve Timm - differences in certificates size.
      * Von: CLI prior to 1.1 included CA certificate chain in certificate file. In 1.1 (latest OSG release) this is fixed.
   * John V.: Sponsor detail is now required. John would like this to be optional.
      * At Argonne, by being an employee, you are entitled to requesting a certificate, don&#39;t need a sponsor. The RAs can do all the validation. So the required sponsor confuses things. Would like language changed to allow Sponsors to be options.
      * Argonne does require sponsors for non-Argonne folks.
      * Have a checkbox for VO to indicate sponsor is required or optional?
      * Von: John H./ATLAS has requested Sponsors be a drop-down box.
      * Having a default sponsor for Argonne employees would help.
      * Default sponsor at CMS is getting hammered - this is Alan Sill right now.
      * Maybe automatically select the Primary Sponsor.
      * AI: Von to write up plan for Primary Sponsor to be default.
   * Other topics?

Agenda:
   * Update on command-line tools (Von)
      * 1.1 released in 3.1.16: http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2013/04/osg-software-version-3116-released.html
         * Changes: https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/osg-cert-scripts-v3/tags/1.1/CHANGELOG.txt

   * Update on OIM web UI (Soichi)
      * Production release today.
         * Announced last week: &quot;I have made a code changes so that DN / contact will be enabled when user issues the certificate. The update will be released to oim-itb tomorrow (4/2) for testing.&quot; - https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/14275
         * Shift from when RA approves to user issues, prevents some &quot;lock ups&quot; that we have seen.
      * 4/5 Certificate issuance problems (Soichi, Von)
         * Issuing failed consequtly on Friday
         * DigiCert was aware of an issue, not sure if they same issue.
         * OIM barfing on the XML we got from DigiCert, but we don&#39;t have the XML in hand (have to turn on debugging to get, but it stopped before)
            * XML contants the API key, which we&#39;d like to keep out of the log. Are technical reasons we can&#39;t pull the meat of the XML.
            * Might have been a network issue?
         * Soichi: concern about availability of information.  
         * Von saw two issues:
            * (1) lack of good debugging information from OIM - I don&#39;t think we know if the problem was at DigiCert or OIM
            * (2) our communication to put certificate issuances on hold wasn&#39;t effective.
               * At least some people heeded it.
         * We have not seen any failures since Friday afternoon, we should send out another notification telling people that certificate services are available.
         * Action Item: Von and Soichi to compose email to DigiCert regarding communication improvements we would like.
         * Action Item: Soichi out another notification telling people that certificate services are available.
         * Who should make the call, normally it sould be Scott or Rob. They were both unavailable, so it fell to Von.
         * Mine: Would like security team kept in the loop about PKI issues.
         * Kevin didn&#39;t receive announcement on Friday?
         * Scott: If there was a full announcement, then email should have gone to osg-general list in addition to the RA/GA notification list.
   * Urgent certificate requests (Von, Alain)
      * https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/14547 - &quot;In the mean time, however, could someone help with the attached CSR so that rsv/atlas.bu.edu doesn&#39;t break tomorrow.
      * Do we want/need a fast track process? What would we do in an emergency?
      * For unregistered domains, registration with DigiCert is an extra step.
      * Will happen again, we will just handle this best effort. No need for special proceedure.
   * &quot;Renewal&quot; of expired certificate (Soichi, Von)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-363#comment-19816
      * Action Item: Soichi will circulate document for feedback with regards to &quot;renewal&quot; of expired certificates.
   * Other topics

      * Spaces are allowed in password, could do pass phrases.
      * Let&#39;s see how this goes for a couple week.
      * Von planning on a survey around June, could include this.
   * Renewal of expired certificate (Soichi, Von)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-363#comment-19816
      * Discuss issue and decide path forward.
      * Why re-request a previous request instead of making a new one? Duplicate DN issue. This may not be an issue any more.
      * Von uncomfortable about this. Soichi to investigate viability to. Von to consider issue.
      * Will it be hard for user to find their original request?
         * Guests can use the search feature. Will need some documentation to get to search tab and set date range.
   * Other topics
      * Chander: Policy question - when someone shows up at OSG PKI door - just for the purpose of signing email - longer-term certificate - are we supporting that?
         * Von: No, I don&#39;t believe that is a supported mode of operation by OSG.

      * Alain: No, things seem quiet.
   * Update on command-line tools (Von)
      * 1.1 release planned for 3.1.16, which is targeted for next Tuesday 4/2: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-931

   * Update on FNAL transition (John B., Kevin)
      * Ready to go, transition complete. Going into project close out.
      * This is no longer a standing agenda item.
   * Forgotten password case (Von, Soichi)
      * Is there understood? Is there an issue with re-requesting?
      * Someone requested a certificate, went to issue it, but forget password.
      * When request is made, DN is disable until approved by RA, then OIM marks email as taken by activite DN, then request reject and OIM considers email/DN active.
      * Change activation of DN until certificate issued?
      * Guest user must supply (retrieval) password (same as P12 file encryption file), authenticated user does not.
      * What can we do to help users know they need to remember their password? Add a note to OIM as to password&#39;s use and need to remember it.
      * Thinking about confirming email. Deferred this conversation.
      * Do we understand how to recover from &quot;email address already registered&quot;?
      * We should be resolving all the cases when this happens.
   * Renewal of expired certificate (Von, Soichi)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-363#comment-19816
      * Deferred discussion
   * Tony: What gets put into email field inside of host certificates?
      * With DOE Grids, requestor of service certificate - their email address would be provided by CA and would be embedded in certificate.
      * CLI doesn&#39;t support this mode currently.
      * There is currently an issue with DigiCert ignoring SAN: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-150
      * AI: Soichi to check that DigiCert is still ignoring SAN.
      * Tony wants to provide, as a GA,

        * Have guess, but have not been able to reproduce. User bouncing between requests/tabs?
      * Any issue with user changing their common name?

      * Who gets to edit the RA lists and Sponsors?
         * Decision: Any contact for the VO in OIM: VO, Admin, Security, Misc, RA
      * Do we allow guest users to enter any email address for sponsor?
         * Mine: In past, have allowed this (e.g. student putting professor name), if RA doesn&#39;t know this, then they ask.
         * Require user to request Sponsor registration first is the alternative.
         * Bad scenario is a user intentionally using a &quot;look alike&quot; email.
         * We stopped short of requiring Sponsors to be registered in OIM, but heavily encourage it.
         * Decision: Allow user to enter a sponsor, but mark it clearly as such.
         * We don&#39;t have a good policy with DOE Grids today on how RAs should handle user-provided Sponsor.
         * RAs should find and document a chain of trust to provided Sponsor through people they know or trusted resources such as HR records.
         * This is what is happening with DOE Grids CA.
         * AI: Alain to document process for RAs to accept user-provided sponsors.
   * Update on FNAL transition (John B., Kevin)
      * Just about ready to go.

      * Rob: Dec-&gt;Jan was a significant increase in number of tickets, even with just 3 days.
         * Little spike in Jan, saw triple # of tickets in Feb, well over 400 for Feb, about 10-12 requests/day.
   * Change management of OIM changes (Von)
      * Change management will be via existing SLA with following changes: https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/OIMServiceLevelAgreement
      * Add a new section &quot;PKI Operator Responsibilities&quot; under &quot;OSG Operations Responsibilities&quot;:
         * Announce to OSG VO RAs and Grid Admins planned changes that will impact them in advance.
         * Provide evaluation period of planned changes in OIM-ITB by OSG VO RAs and Grid Admins.
      * AI: Rob to review and approve or not.
      * Question: Do we have an announcement mechanism for communicating with RAs and GAs? Soichi: Yes, send email to GOC, they have notification form they can use.
   * Ramping down Transition Calls (Von)
      * Proposal: Last transition call will be April 2nd. After that conversations about the production PKI will be on the [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes][Monday Noon CT/1pm ET OSG Production Call].

   * Update on January 30th transition (Von)
      * Text is up on DOE site: https://pki1.doegrids.org/ca/
      * Renewal emails as of Feb 4 should include text as well.
      * Rob: more visibility - he nows sees every ticket, but they seem to be getting processed quickly.
   * Update on command-line tools (Von)
      * 1.1 branch is frozen and Software team has been asked to produce RPM. ETA is end of February.
      * Planning on 1.2 release that will include renewal: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-317
      * Von would like encourage folks to test the source code.
      * Current 1.0 RPM should work.
   * Update on OIM web UI (Soichi)
      * From last week: Working on certificate renwal implementation. Next production release is Feb 12, ITB is next week, will have more details.
      * Fixes:
         * Increased maximum gridadmin count from 10 to 30 as requested by Alain Deximo.
            * This is a UI as opposed to a DB issue. This is a limit on DNS-VO combination.
         * Stopped assigning Alain Deximo to secondary RA on all new VO.
         * Fixed the home icon issue on certificate page
         * Added setter for SUPPORTING_SC_NAME ticket metadata on resource and vo registration notification
         * Updated help link label based on Von&#39;s suggestion [OSGPKI-306]
         * Updated host certificate CSR help content and hidden under a help link.
         * PKI Rest API / Updated exception detail to reflect the error condition more accurately.
         * PKI Rest API / Reformatted user certificate request ticket title to be more consistent with other tickets.
         * PKI Rest API / Added request_comment support for various APIs.
         * PKI / Removed RENEW_REQUESTED state and transitions which is no longer necessary.

         * PKI User Certificate / Implemented renew method 
         * PKI User Certificate GUI / Made &quot;Generaring CSR&quot; indicator to display only when it actually needs generate CSR.
         * PKI User Certificate GUI / Added last approved time indicator
         * PKI REST API / removed host_certs_renew and implemented user_cert_renew/user_cert_retrieve/user_cert_approve/user_cert_reject/user_cert_cance/user_cert_revoke/user_cert_issue APIs (no user_cert_request)
         * (Released) Updated certificate redirector (/certificate) into a normal page, and made it editable by admin and admin_ra(to allow osg pki staff to edit)
   * Update on FNAL transition (John B., Kevin)
      * No new problems
      * Report that older pacman-distrubed GUMS have an compatibility problem (proxy cert on worker node trying contact this version; other case, if WN has no cert, and uses pilot certificate will have same problem).
         * Correct solution seems to be folks should upgrade latest (RPM) version of GUMS.
   * Message for OSG Production - what should Von ask Dan to convey
      * Sites should upgrade to latest version of GUMS
      * AI: Von to check with Steve T. and Brian on wether it is the latest version or any RPM version.
      * If sites don&#39;t upgrade to latest version of GUMS, then VOs should only register single certificate per user.
      * Latest version requires host to group mapping to look at hostname of the machine instead of DN, allow lookup of any name in group instead of own mapping.
      * Tony will send Von email on this.
   * Communications (Ruth, Von)
      * See Jan 30 above.
   * Update on recent GA/VO changes (Von, Tony, Soichi, Rohan)
      * Tony will try to make time in the next week to look at 1.1 code.
   * Open discussion.
   * Mine: Trouble signing emails because CERN is putting CERN email into certificates. This is used by some CMS admins, doesn&#39;t effect everyday user, but may be a lesson learned for others. May impact communications with GOC.

   * Improving communications - post mortem on recent GA/VO changes (Von)
      * The changes surprised some people. Going forward we need to make sure we alert our RAs/GAs about such changes.
      * Appear in OIM-ITB first to give them a chance to preview/comment?
      * Do we have a communication mechanism to our RAs/GAs?
      * ChangeLog for OIM needs to include GAs and RAs?

Action Items from last week:
   * Von: Will DOE PKI continue to send out renewal emails after March 23rd? Von hopes so and will pose to ESnet.
   * Von will extend the invitation to DigiCert for OSG AHM
      * DONE: Scott Rea may attend if schedule allows

Agenda:
   * ATLAS status (Von)
      * LFC issue: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-296
      * John H. is still investigating, but it is looking likely this was a configuration error.,
   * Update on command-line tools (Von)
      * Freezing 1.1 branch and talking to TIm C. about new RPM
      * Working on renewal client (user and host) - will be after this next RPM
      * Will establish B&amp;T tests and OIM tests
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-759
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/ALERT-7
   * Update on OIM web UI (Soichi)
      * ITB release for 1/22 (first release since December)
         * Biggest update is change for how Grid Admin info is stored, previously had list of contacts, to address issue raised by FNAL to limit Grid Admins to those relevant to VO for request.
         * Need to wait until new client release to put VO information into OIM and fully test this.
      * Production release - updates in release notes - they go out to osg-operations and osg-sites
      * VO indication testing with Tony and Alain went well, 
      * Next step is to test CLI with Rohan, is in head-of-svn, Tony is interested in test - Von will send him info he needs
         * AI: Von to send to Tony information he needs to test CLI.
      * Change to GA request form - template has been augmented with VO field - adds notes to ticket
      * Otherwise
   * Update on FNAL transition (John B., Kevin)
      * Progressing along with VOs, about 38% are ready. Continuing to push hard.
      * Do have PKI documentation - under one last review - looks good for 28th
   * Ready for production on Jan 30th (delay until OIM is ready)
      * ESNet will encourage users to OSG PKI
      * CMS wants extra sentrance in ESNet&#39;s posting. Does FNAL want something equivalent? Seems like it. AI: John will send sentence to Von to include.
      * AI: Von to set up call with ESNet - include delay 30th
      * AI: Rob will request idmanager.opensciencegrid.org pointing OIM/oim/certificate
         * Twiki page with expired certificate creates an error
         * Needs to be public readable
         * Does OIM have the same issue? Soichi says no, OIM sorts out these issues.
         * OIM changes happen on release cycle.
         * OIM can display content that OSG staff can set more dynamically.
         * Is idm.opensciencegrid.org better?
         * Decision: idmanager.opensciencegrid.org
         * AI: Von will propose text to Soichi to add to /oim/certificate
            * Changes will happen Jan 29th
         * Decision: delay go-live until 30th
   * Communications (Ruth, Von)
      * Ruth is happy with text. Send before URL is live.
      * Von will edit communication with URL.
   * Renewal notifications (Soichi)
      * How do we handle this? How do people want to receive this? Use GOC ticket - reopen and update ticket - will send email.
      * Rob suggests opening new ticket instead of re-opening old ticket. (Reference old ticket.)
      * Von suggests new ticket references old ticket so we have chain.
      * Would ticket closure be automated when renewal happens? Yes.
      * Christiane - make the message clear.
      * What happens if user has forgotten password? They would need to request new certificate. Would need to deal with email address.
         * We think we soilved the email re-use problem? User needs to requestion revocation.
         * AI: Alain will writea document forthe use case of a user who has forgotten their password/lost their private key and send to the group.
   * Christiane: OK to request host certificate from OSG PKI to replace those about to expire? Yes, assuming user community trusts CA 
   * Other issues?

---++ 8 Jan 2013

No calls since 11 Dec 2012 due to travel and holiday.

Attending: Von, Mine, Kevin, Alain D., Rob Q., John Benson, Tony, Soichi, Dhiva

Topics:
   * Project status:
      * Goal is to reach operations by January 28th, 2013.
      * Proposal: Request DOE Grids CA cease issuing new certificates start of business March 23rd, 2013 (CRLs would continue for another year). Rational: LHC shutdown is March 11th, followed by the OSG AHM the following week and then a DOE PI meeting (Von Welch attending) the week after, making this the first non-conflicted date. Feedback is sought from the community on this date.
      * There are currently two blockers to the OSG PKI being production-ready (i.e. DOE Grids PKI encourages users to use the OSG PKI instead):
         * Incompatibility between OSG PKI proxy certificates and ATLAS Panda servers at CERN. Status: GridSite developers have released an RPM with a fix, CERN deployed that fix earlier today and it is pending on testing by ATLAS.
            * Update from John H. via email during the call.: Looking good so far. A job has been running for 5 hours. I&#39;m trying to get access to the worker node to look at the ongoing output. Of course the key test is stage-out.
         * Establishment of Fermilab Service Desk as RA for a number of VOs. Fermilab serves as a RA for a number of OSG VOs and has a parallel project in progress to establish this functionality for the OSG PKI. See https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Council/January-8-2013/OSG_VOs_and_PKI_RA_Progress.pdf for specific VOs. (Shooting for Jan 28th.)
            * Discussion if this should be a blocker. Von will raise this as off-line conversation with Ruth, Kevin, Rob, and John.
      * Other activities (not blockers to production):
         * While RAs for the large VOs have been established, progress continues for a number of smaller ones. Outside of the Fermilab VOs mentioned as a blocker, none of these pending VOs are considered blockers.
         * Discussion regarding whether we have the host-certificate/VO model right for optimal operations.
         * Improvements to client software based on initial user feedback.
         * Renewal capability. Has been deferred since it will not be needed for ~6 months but should be completed by operations. Needs support in OIM and client.
            * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-202
         * Documentation improvements based on user feedback.
         * Possible test audit with DigiCert (pending their engagement)
         * Other OIM development: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-181
   * Report on stress-test of OIM-ITB
      * In general, I call the tests successful. Thank you to DigiCert and the GOC for their monitoring, and to Christiane and FusionGrid for helping test.
      * Rohan and I were able to pull down a total of 1470 certificates during the hour using the bulk host request interface with no problems. Additionally a uncounted much smaller number of certificates from unit tests and by Christiane were downloaded.
      * Rohan and I noticed that time to download for both of us was well under 5 minutes, but was slower on my Mac (49 certs took ~2:30 for Rohan, ~3:30 for me). Cause is uncertain - slower processor and encrypted filesystem are both suspects.
      * Times were fairly constant (+/-10%), but we might have seen a slow down during the last 5 minutes (my times jumped by 20% for my last two runs; Rohan&#39;s not so steeply). But the testing ended too early to say this was a definite trend.
      * Christiane had an issue with a user cert request during the testing, unclear if related, Soichi is looking at it: https://ticket-itb.grid.iu.edu/goc/2812
      * We discovered a (client-side, head of SVN) quota bug and so we were pulling down 49 certificates at a time instead of 50: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-283
      * Having to clear quotas was the a clear limiting factor, I suspect we could have done 20-30% more certificates without quotas.
   * Update on FNAL Service Desk progress
      * Fermilab service desk wants to service a number of VOs; should they just sign up for all of these VOs in OIM? Should we bulk add them?
      * There are a handful of VOs that would want to be separate in any case.
      * Does FermiLab service desk need to know the VO? GOC tickets sets support center in GOC ticket, but not implemented for PKI. Steve Timm asked about ServiceNow integration - Soichi says this is doable, users need to specify support center in addition to Fermilab VO.
      * Onus is on Fermilab to describe what they want if not signing up
   * Continue role of the VO in host certificate issuance discussion
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-266
      * Requires re-structuring of how Grid Admin is stored, from flat list to hierarchy based on VO.
      * This will relieve some pain, not is not a blocker. Tony considers it a high priority. E.g. one request generated four emails - scale that up to 1000 nodes is 3000 emails for each GA.
   * Other topics?
      * Kevin asked about vomses file being updated when new certificate being issued and if you can put multiple DNs into vomses file? We understand from the VOMS developers that this will work, but haven&#39;t tested it.
         * Tony tested it live, by putting in 2 DNs (one garbage) for a VOMS server and determined it worked (voms-proxy-init used the right one).
         * Referecence: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/VomsesFilewithNewPKI
         * Tony noted that OSG&#39;s vom-proxy-init doesn&#39;t validate voms certificate, so changing the vomses file isn&#39;t even necessary (the DN in the vomses file is not used).
            * Older voms-proxy-init might give a warning but it will still work (you end up with a valid proxy).
         * WLCG clients do use DN, so we need to have correct DNs in their vomses file.
         * Rob to update twiki page above with this information.
      * Mine reporting that people not able to find our documentation. Google isn&#39;t helpful.
         * May need to modify old documents to point at new documents.
         * Add a link to https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/WebHome
         * Rob took an action item to explore this.
         * We could put old documents into robots.txt
         * Alain has pointers to new documents in old documents, but it&#39;s not bold or clearly marking old documents as old.
         * Rob: Ops team is working on adding more graphics to documentation.
