---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJanuary29][previous meeting]]

1) Secure TWiki
   * A restart at end of business today to resolve some lingering issues with some URLs not redirecting. GOC will send mailings notifying the community.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on GROW

   * Two primary applications. Medical imaging applications. They&#39;ve recently added a new Resource. A remote campus will be bringing on a 64-core cluster like the one GROW has already.

2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus

   * *This week*: Still having issues at UNM because of the time discrepancy between Condor (minutes) and PBS (a different format). Requested time is 880 minutes, but was being treated as something like 880 hours. Two jobs have given an error of not having enough disk space, but that shouldn&#39;t be the actual issue. Seven jobs at Purdue, four having problems. And a few jobs at Venderbilt with trouble running internal script argument files, which he has contacted them about.

---++ OSG RA Items

No items.

---++ Pending Registrations

None.

---+++ NWICG
   * 2753 - Condor-G jobs to Notre Dame NWICG fail with an authorization error
      * VOMS updated at NWICG, so this should be resolved. GOC will contact the customer to verify the resolution.

---++ Other issues

GROW would like more support. The GOC will get more information from Eric and send a message out to the Support Centers requesting increased support.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

   * Joint Ops meeting in Indianapolis in the first week of June. (4-7) We were asked to move it up to the last week of May, but that is not a good time due to Indianapolis 500 activities.
