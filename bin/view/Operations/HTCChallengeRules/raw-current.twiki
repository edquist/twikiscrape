---++ Challenge Ground Rules

---+++ Challenge Time
   * Start Time: Begins when rules are explained during the Challenge Session - 11am, Tuesday, April 8, 2014.
   * End of Challenge: All submissions must be received by 11:30am on Wednesday, April 9, 2014 to be eligible for judging.

---+++ Requirements
   * OSG-Connect must be used as the submission mechanism.
   * Jobs should run on a variety of OSG resources (do not target a single resource). 
   * Submission file must contain the Challenge Project Name (+projectName = &quot;HTCC&quot;)
   * No accuracy checking is necessary. Do not preform multiple runs once you have your final data in hand. 
   * This is a team challenge so each team should consist of 2-3 competitors. 

---+++ Scoring Criteria
   1 Delivery of the data via any means to our challenge researcher played by Kyle Gross.  If emailing, just send an email with the location of the files to kagross@iu.edu. All teams will be ranked in the order of the data received. 
   2 Analysis of the submission file/technique by panel of judges. Deliver your submission file and any other important files your submission is dependent on such as wrappers, dagman, etc. 
   3 In a real world situation this would be only a small portion of the actual workflow, several more steps would be necessary to reach useful human parsable output. What steps could be taken to improve efficiency of data management during a large workflow? One paragraph explanation of ideas. 

---+++ Challenge Referee
All decisions on requirements violations and scoring will be made by the Challenge referee. This referee will determine penalties and decisions will be final.
