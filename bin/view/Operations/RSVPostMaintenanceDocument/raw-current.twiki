---+ Post Upgrade Functionality Checks

This document is to provide a list of checks that will test the functionality of rsv.grid.iu.edu after an upgrade has been done.

---++ Checks Immediately after service is brought up
   * Log into rsv.grid.iu.edu and become root
      * Execute /opt/service-monitor/rsv/test.sh Any errors will generate an alert e-mail
   * Verify metric data is being sent to SAM
      * There should be files as recent as 5 minutes ago in /usr/local/rsv-sam-uploader/data/metric-output/done/yyyy/mm/dd
   * Verify the daily [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/][reports]] web page is up.
   * Register a &quot;Downtime&quot; of 1 minute for is.grid.iu.edu [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/resourcedowntimeedit?rid=274][here]]

---++ 3 hours after maintenance
   * Verify the &quot;Downtime&quot; regestered above was received. /usr/local/rsv-sam-uploader/data/downtime-records/done/yyyy/mm/dd will contain a file associated with the registration. There are typically very few such files.

---++ One day after maintenance
   * On the morning after maintenance, verify the daily report e-mails have been sent.
   * Verify the [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/][reports]] page has updated
