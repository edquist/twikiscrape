-- Main.ScottTeige - 18 Jul 2011

---+++ Announcements
   * Power maintenance by IU engineers in Indianapolis machine room completed without incident Jul 14-15
   * IU network engineers plan another outage Sunday Jul 24, 6:00-8:00 AM EDT 
      * Anticipated to be very short, 10-15 minutes.
      * Plan for this time same as for last time.
   * _All present accepted the plan_

---+++ Glide-in SLA
   * Should be &quot;High Priority&quot; service
   * 99% Availability
   * Target to Production Aug 8th.
      * Backup date of Aug 22nd if any issues are experienced. 
   * Currently working on monitoring of service.
   * Moving forward: (Igor Sfiligoi)
      * We plan to initially support only &quot;vanilla OSG&quot; entry points.
        This means not HTPC or weird RSL parameters.
      * We have to decide what glideinWMS version to use.
        We currently have the UCSD branch installed. Version 2.5.1 is not really usable, and 2.5.2 is not yet out.
        We will re-evaluate once 2.5.2 is out.
      * We need clarification on how we decide which VOs/frontends to support.
        Do we still have full autonomy, or do we need to co-ordinate with GOC on this?
      * We need to formalize the change management plan. Until now it was a very abstract concept in our discussions.
         * BTW: We are supposed to get a &quot;test gfactory&quot; node. What are the plans at GOC for this?
      * We need to agree with GOC what areas need backing up, monitoring, etc.
   * _Discussion lead to the conclusion this should be a &quot;Normal&quot; priority service with a target of 97% availability. Scott and Rob will meet with Igor and Jeff to work out details of change management etc. The VM for development work will be available shortly, possibly tomorrow._
   * _Target date  of 8/Aug is reasonable, Will request CMS and GLUEX begin using the service at that time._
 
---+++ ITB release tomorrow
   * OS updates, will require reboot.
   * Installed capacity report to be installed on OIM-ITB

---+++ Top level BDII
   * _Internal testing of a v5 BDII on a VM indicated there were limits on performance, currently not known if that limit compares to actual demand._
   * _It was also determined that LVS load balancing provided ~30% better performance than DNS RR_
   * _Rob will ping Lorenzo Dimi to evaluate status and desirability of this service._

---+++ Lifecycle machines 
   * _New RAID cards have been ordered, to be installed upon arrival, usual installation to begin after that._
