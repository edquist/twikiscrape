---++ OSG RA Items

The GOC will soon host the CA Certificates packages. By default, you will get no CAs; administrators will need to configure their CE to accept trusted CAs. More details are forthcoming. The VDT will mirror the GOC CA packages for a short time to make the transition a smooth one.

Ticket was assigned on 8/29. | 8/29 | Elizabeth &amp; Kyle | BNL sent an update, but they might have removed the &quot;ISSUE=&quot; from the subject line or they sent the update to us from an address outside of RT, and that would have been rejected by the GOC ticketing system. |

---+++ Other issues

---++ WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

   1. WLCG broker - no data is being lost, but there is a problem with the mechanism being used by WLCG to collect RSV records. If you look at SAMS interface, typically in the morning, and you see something is down, the problem is due to the records building up. This mostly affects CMS and ATLAS.

   2. Tim and Guenter are working on improving the ticket exchange. Ticket updates will flow automatically without the current need for manual intervention.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans
