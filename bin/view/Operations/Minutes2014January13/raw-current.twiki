---++ WLCG &amp; EGI Operations

---++ Security
Versions of ntpd prior to version 4.2.7p26 with a default configuration
allowing unrestricted queries can be used to amplify a DDOS attack due
to it responding to queries with large status messages to spoofed source
addresses.

The perfSONAR Performance Toolkit software has been found to ship with a
vulnerable configuration. An update to address it is forthcoming from
the perfSONAR team. Manual reconfiguration is recommended in the meantime.

Recent Scientific Linux installations should have a secure NTP
configuration by default, but should be reviewed by sysadmins to verify
no insecure changes have been made.

Some useful links:
   * http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/348126 - CERT article on the
vulnerability, with configuration information.
   * https://www.team-cymru.org/ReadingRoom/Templates/secure-ntp-template.html
 - Secure NTP configuration info for various systems.
