---+++ GGUS interoperability
From Burt:
&lt;pre&gt;
Doug,

Can you give an update at the SC meeting today on GGUS/OSG interoperability?  There are 
two use cases I have in mind that should be disambiguated if possible (but I don&#39;t know 
enough on the LCG side to know if it&#39;s possible):

1. LCG user has issue with OSG resource in US
2. LCG user has issue with LCG resource in US

For #1, the path is clear: GGUS -&gt; GOC -&gt; Resource SC
For #2, I believe it should go GGUS -&gt; ROC_US (LCG) -&gt; Resource.

I am at least trying to set up a mailing list for ROC_US that contains ATLAS and 
USCMS Support people since I believe that covers current US LCG usage.  (Currently a 
number of tickets just get randomly routed to uscms-ops.)

But I don&#39;t think it will be clear from the GGUS point of view that there is any 
difference betweeen 1 and 2 -- these are just sites reporting to the resource broker.  
Are we prepared to handle #2 through #1 as the cost of federating grids?

- B 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some discussion - leading to Burt going to walk through a few more use cases.

Doug pointed out that tickets from GGUS are supposed to be labelled with the VO of
the person originating the ticket, and this could be used to route a ticket
to the proper VO support center on OSG.
