---++ OSG RA Items

Anything new to report on the upcoming changes to the DOEGrids CA?

July 5th at 9AM Pacific. Expected downtime is 4 hours. The certificates script package that talks to the CA will need to be updated. It will be tested during the upgrade process, then made available shortly after the upgrade is completed. Older scripts, such as the grid admin script will not function with the new version of the software.

---++ Pending Registrations

---+++ Support Center

SBGrid _Approved_

20 nodes coming online. maybe up to 10 core users currently, but may expand to 20-30. They are using RT as their ticket system. GOC will communicate with them offline to implement the VDT script to prevent mail loops between ticket systems.

---+++ Resources

1) GRASE-RPI-COLONYD Resource/Service Registration _Approved_
   * Supported by GRASE. Production CE.

2) ORNL_NSTG
   * Production CE supported by CSC. _Approved_

3) GLOW

---+++ Other issues

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

1) Reporting through OSG to the SAM environment will probably be around September, although things may be in place before then.

2) Geant4 ticket opened last week or the week prior. Particia with the VO is communicating with Burt and heh has told her how to restructure the jobs. They&#39;re happy with the response rate, but the success rate satisfaction is in question.

3) A European ATLAS site was contacted about a USCMS site issue. No update has been received to the ticket. GOC will followup this week.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments &amp; Plans
