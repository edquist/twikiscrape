Dear OSG Council

For much of the last 2 weeks I have been on vacation.

In the meantime the usage of OSG has been steadily high, with an average  use of around 17.5K cpu weeks/week.   A user from the GLOW VO was able to ramp up quickly to 36,000 cpu hours/day  across more than 20 sites (1500 cpus dc) across many OSG sites to run Superlink (see attached). http://cbl-link02.cs.technion.ac.il/superlinkattechnion/download_all.php

&quot;Superlink helps geneticists perform genetic linkage analysis -  a statistical method used to associate functionality of genes with their location on chromosomes. It typically serves for detecting mutated disease-provoking genes. This analysis can be extremely computationally intensive and has been parallelized for simultaneous execution on many computers. Geneticists submit the data for the analysis via Superlink-online linkage analysis portal. The tasks are then automatically parallelized and scheduled for execution on many computers in the Technion, in the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and also on many computers all over the world.&quot;

On OSG the jobs run under BOINC submitted by Condor-G. We understand this is another science running under a general Campus Grid VO. The Executive Team has started discussions of how best to meet the requirement of (some?) sites to know the science domain of the users jobs. We will devote the December blueprint meeting (week of 8th December) to this, with the goal to have a plan available for the next face to face Council meeting in March.

The Software Tools Group has started its work and is working on the plan for the next version of the Resource and Service Validation tests. The external accounting project has completed its major development for OSG with the release of Gratia V1.0.

The site administrators meeting is shaping  with 24 people so far registered.

If people are interested in OSG brochures for their exhibits at SC08 please contact Marcia Teckenbrock at marcia@fnal.gov

We held our annual meeting with our Northwest Indiana Computing Grid partner. The main outcomes were that a) the Notre Dame site has cycles and are happy for people to use them. If you have tried and have problems please let them know and b) that the Calumet site is interested in partnering on education and training with some local faculty and students to take them over the threshold of using distributed computing.
