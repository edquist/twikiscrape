Rick- who in XSEDE will want to use this? Identified 4 candidates during last quarterly allocation meeting that might have used OSG had it been available at that point. Tried to explain at XSEDE meeting the work best suited to OSG. Will need to learn as we move forward. Offering about (1-2) % of OSG resources, or about 10% of opportunistic resources available on a daily basis. OSG allocation is best effort.

Get current tech plan in place, make it execute- basic approach- get input late Spring/ early Summer time-frame, then think about growing offering.
