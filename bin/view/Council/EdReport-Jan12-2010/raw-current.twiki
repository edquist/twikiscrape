---+ Executive Director’s report

---++ LHC Operations:

During the last month there have been 2 availability issues with the information published by the OSG to the WLCG information systems (BDII). In the first instance no OSG data was available for CMS-wide job routing; in the second instance data stale by several hours was available.  The overall availability did meet that defined in the OSG – US LHC BDII SLA available through policies.opensciencegrid.org.  This has previously been identified as a complex and fragile multi-layered service.  Dan Fraser (Production Coordinator) and Rob Quick (Operations Coordinator) are working on detailed root cause analyses for the outages, and on mitigations and services that would prevent and/or better notify the operations staff in the case of future occurrences. 

The US CMS UCSD Tier-2 was inaccessible for job execution for several days due to a corrupt DOE Grids Certificate issue. There is possibly a second occurrence at the Florida site. Mine Altunay (Security Officer) worked with Dan and the UCSD site administrators on the root cause analysis and on identifying changes in the Certificate validation testing codes and procedures.  

Issues were identified with automated alarm ticket routing between the WLCG GGUS, OSG GOC and US ATLAS support center. The route cause analysis identified issues with the OSG’s end-to-end response checking and routing that are being addressed. More ongoing monitoring and “heart-beats” will be put in place. 

CPU usage of resources accessible through the OSG is down significantly over the holiday period. 

Efficiency and Throughput of the Infrastructure:
OSG project staff are working on throughput and efficiency issues for LIGO E@H and SBGrid applications. 

---++ LIGO
There is a major ongoing VDT effort to provide native packaging of the OSG software stack – with LIGO being the first recipient of the deliverables needed for their sites on the LIGO Data Grid. The first packages are under test by the LIGO collaborators. 

---++ Council Action Items
---+++ 9. Evaluate how best to establish and exercise Science Advisory Group (SAG):

Input from the three SAG members who were contacted by phone before Christmas is [[SAGInput][here]]:
Piotr is talking with the 2 biology members and Paul is contacting Bill Tang.

Once this is done the sub-group (Ruth Pordes, Scott McCauley?, Jerome Lauret, Piotr Sliz) will plan the responses and next step.

---+++ 10. Establish a subcommittee of the Open Science Grid (Executive Board) to determine how to migrate effort from core activities to provide support and architecture for the long term.


Technology Group established reporting to the Technology Director (Miron);  John Hover from BNL/Michael Ernst’s group is leading the group; LIGO representation is Patrick Brady; US CMS contributing Catalin Domescue/FNAL. Mail list can be joined by anyone is at osg-blueprint@opensciencegrid.org. 3 activities to date:
   1 Draft charter posted at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Blueprint/WebHome.
   1 Identifying 5 core technical and operational issues of the major stakeholders for next ~1-5 years and discussing technical directions to address them
      1 Issues on the table; Asking for evaluations and working with OSG performance and scalability effort (Igor Sfiligoi); thinking about directions for CE – CREAM and/or GT5. 
   1 Help Ruth in delivery of Architecture document to the Council. Draft document in progress. Scope is to address “Enterprise Architecture” - the end-to-end solutions - futures with “as is” documentation as a basis. There is an intent to point to existing documentation wherever possible, to have the existing documentation as the master, and to identify questions and holes that need to be or could be addressed in the future within or through the  OSG. Document has the following sections:
      1 Overall goals
      1 Business  - includes operating model,  capabilities and capacities, organization and organization cycles, processes and policies, interfaces to “suppliers”
      1 Information – describing the information owned by the OSG and stored on behalf of the members.
      1 Application – diagrams of the data, job, security and operations components and interfaces of (at minimum) ATLAS, CMS, LIGO, OSG Engage.
      1 Technology – diagrams of OSG operations, OSG technologies, discussions of future directions.


---++ Interactions with DOE - HEP and ASCR

Request from LHC Program managers for US ATLAS and US CMS to work with OSG management to &quot;..describe the essential services and infrastructure supplied by OSG for LHC computing operations and provide a cost estimate for those services in analogy to the proposed European model which includes identifying the core services currently provided by EGEE to wLCG.  Be certain to note commonalities and differences between U.S. ATLAS and U.S. CMS.  Please describe the service level agreements with OSG for those services.   Identify potential issues associated with  a possible  transitioning  of  these services to the LHC Operations Program and suggest possible solutions.&quot;

The PI and ED provided slides to the ASCR program managers as part of a continuing discussion of OSG status and futures. Two reports were given to ASCR on specific impacts recognized as due to ASCR support for the OSG:
