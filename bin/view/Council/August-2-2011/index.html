<h3><a name="OSG_Executive_Director_Report_Ru"></a> OSG Executive Director Report- Ruth Pordes </h3>
RE: Clemson opportunistic cycles: Miriam Boone to work with site administrators, where there is a mix of usage in different communities, to have an OSG Newsletter article.
<p />
<span class="twikiNewLink">InDHTC<a href="/bin/edit/Council/InDHTC?topicparent=Council.August-2-2011" rel="nofollow" title="InDHTC (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> proposal sent to DOE ASCR was declined as “out of scope”.
<p />
Emails to OSG Council are bouncing- Richard, due to new Fermilab spam filter. Being looked at now.
<p />
Richard and David Skinner, NERSC, organizing “Collaboration for Extreme Scale Science” workshop, Dec. 6 &amp; 7. Aim to “Strengthen motivation for funding/ collaboration for extreme scale science program by Oscar.
<p />
FY12 Planning (slide)-Ruth is an area coordinator, project administration. 
<p />
US ID Management group (slide)- full plan anticipated in early September.
<p />
Focus on Software Short Term (Slide)-trying to understand GT5- not used before, approach carefully, significant change in software version that will be installed on science and that will affect all pilot jobs that are submitted- needs widespread testing.
<p />
Software- moving to RPM-based distribution (Richard’s presentation at Staff Retreat)
<p />
2 week holdup of <span class="twikiNewLink">PacMan<a href="/bin/edit/Council/PacMan?topicparent=Council.August-2-2011" rel="nofollow" title="PacMan (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> release when Horst went on vacation. Revisiting issue to avoid this kind of delay for RPM release (January?)
Test version of RPM will be available for CD (GT5 non-Cream version)
<p />
Questions:  Miron- In the management of opportunistic resources, how much do the sites want to delegate allocation to OSG and how much to them? EMI project release- is it going to continue to be released/supported?
<p />
RP ACTION ITEM: Find where Council is mentioned in OSG documents: <ul>
<li> Charter (needs revisiting)- no mention
</li> <li> Bylaws, blueprint 1st paragraph- echoes bylaws/cooperative agreement.
</li> <li> language re: executive team/board, and extensive comments on the operation of the Council
</li> <li> Is text appropriate for what we want for next year or two?
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="OUTCOME_Action_Item_s"></a> OUTCOME/Action Item(s) </h4>
<p /> <ul>
<li> Find effort within project to pay attention to requirements and gather them.How do OSG sites get involved? 
</li> <li> Action: Talk to group and have them talk to Jim Basney.
</li> <li> Future Action: Implementing Bestman and Bestman II. (Task for FY12) Issue to come before council, commitment from OSG to have sustaining support/ work w/ communities that use.
</li> <li> If something is missing from the “Goals to be prioritized in January” slide (4.2), let Alain know.
</li> <li> At Site Administrators meeting in Texas next week, Alan will train people on how to do testing. RP wants representation from all communities there, if possible (See slide 28).  If missing a community, tell RP.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Technical_Director_report_Miron"></a> Technical Director report- Miron Livny </h3>
Ruth-resurrect collecting requirements (for software activity we have available not whole scope) from major stakeholders, VOs. Put outcomes into user support. 
<p />
LB- think about how OSG can benefit smaller communities, by sharing data management/ movement expertise, submitting jobs in cohesive way.
<p />
Miron- Discover what campuses need. Current attitude is one size fits all.
<p />
Tom Hacker-Purdue- issue on campuses is what to do with scientific data, how manage, curate, store, and share. OSG can leverage knowledge and try to solve this pain point.
<p />
Questions: Council What is the difference between 2005 and 2012? Decision as to how different opportunistic users use OSG, how should we position ourselves with funding agencies i.e. DOE/NSF. Scheduling- understand opportunities on data side/ identity management. (We have to schedule, move data and perform identity management) 
<h4><a name="OUTCOME_Action_Item_s_AN1"></a> OUTCOME/Action Item(s) </h4>
<p /> <ul>
<li> Trash/Trash/Blueprint of OSG- Council to read. 
</li> <li> Council to send Miron feedback re: extent council is prepared to guide, direct? 
</li> <li> Council to help in talking with sponsor, writing of proposal, outline how to talk to agencies?
</li> <li> Future council meeting: poll VOs if they want to be a prototype tester (follow from NEEs archiving model)
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="ESnet_representative_Michael_Ern"></a> ESnet representative - Michael Ernst (LBNL) </h3>
Presented by Bill Johnston of ESnet, NERSC
<p />
Develop more coherent class of application related issues.
<p />
Separate campus into network architectures, one for data intensive one for network-specific info.
<p />
Topic for Richard’s workshop- Getting collaborations on board, refining elevator pitch.
<p />
Relationship between ESNETESNET and OSG- deeply involved in data anywhere “stuff”. Will work with ESnet to see how this is in relation to OSG.
<p />
ELI- promoted to Joint Tech- several from universities interested in it.
<p />
Questions:  How do you see this group interacting with university campug organizations (A: LBNL doesn’t, major DOE science projects will.)
<p />
<h4><a name="OUTCOME_Action_Item_s_AN2"></a> OUTCOME/Action Item(s) </h4> <ul>
<li> OSG to follow up on proposal, make an assessment on usefulness of this performance working group and how OSG will interact-LBNL
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Update_on_ATLAS_opportunistic_us"></a> Update on ATLAS opportunistic usage - Michael Ernst </h3>
Do not want VOs to approach US ATLAS sites directly; VO reps contact facility manager (US/ATLAS) - Implement opportunistic usage for VOs other than US ATLAS.
<p />
Questions: Which VOs to add next? Ready for another? Had meeting with HCC/Engage, depends on demand from HCC. Open up for opportunistic users in a  very controlled way.
<p />
<h3><a name="Report_from_Council_members_on_t"></a> Report from Council members on talking to sponsors - All – Paul Avery </h3>
Request for Letter of Commitment.
<p />
SBGrid submitted proposal to NSF, with OSG component (satellite proposal) .
<p />
Miron suggests adding people to fight for funding, esp. high profile (poss. Nobel prize) scientists providing context for need i.e. search for Higgs compromised w/ out OSG.
<p />
Richard noted experience of Joseph Perl of SLAC: getting $ out of NIH successfully depends on collaboration i.e. Harvard med, SLAC- pose OSG as a tool for medical research, fall under med research funding.
<p />
MIron- Look at Galaxy if intention is to bring in more biologists- more accessible than SCI Linux.
<p />
Questions: How does DOE regard connection with OSG? How much effort should OSG put into non-traditional users?
<p />
<h4><a name="OUTCOME_Action_Item_s_AN3"></a> OUTCOME/Action Item(s) </h4>
<p /> <ul>
<li> US LHC JOG meeting in October- ATLAS/CMS, suggest that OSG is on the agenda.  Make sure they understand how Tier 3’s contribute to physics output. (Bob, Nick, have this discussion with the program Manager)
</li> <li> Discussion w/ Executive team need for consortium members to help- US LHC Council members to follow up with funding agent, get participating institutions to contact agencies. Run 2 experiments to speak to spokespeople. Reach out to DOE, other members of council, encourage giving talks on your campus etc. 
</li> <li> CDF and DZero go to Spoke’s, what would they say? Write something up with bullet points for each experiment (Refer to run 2 assessment document written last year defining dependency on OSG. Include chart with effort profile submitted to DOE/NSF i.e. Mass apply as major stakeholder to NIH?
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Report_from_iSGTW_board_meeting"></a> Report from iSGTW board meeting - Paul Avery, Miriam Boon </h3> <ul>
<li> 1st face-to-face board meeting, discussed big changes i.e. David Ritchie retiring, EU down 1 board member 
</li> <li> Discussions occurring with XCEDE
</li> <li> Signed MOU w/ Simon Lynn (Taipei) to hire someone with half effort on iSGTW covering Asia.
</li> <li> Deciding on changing iSGTW name? (no longer covering grid computing alone, lack of name recognition)
</li></ul> 
<p />
Questions: Who should replace these members? Positions on board to convince organizations to commit to publication/involvement.
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Campus_Grids_Dan_Fraser"></a> Campus Grids - Dan Fraser </h3>
Discussion re: how to put OSG interface behind their XSEDE interface. Proposing to keep XSEDE interface and something with OSG behind it. Have to hide from TG users – they don’t know anything about certificates.
<p />
Lothar and Dave discussed with Rob Snihur a plan to work w/ CMS Tier 3’s. CMS side, submitting jobs to local resource, trying to get them to submit to other clusters. Work w/ Rob to get software they need on other cluster/ use campus grid technology to bridge interfaces.
<p />
Target some of university’s that already understand high throughput computing, i.e. Tier 3’s w/ existing Condor infrastructure.
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="NEES_Results_Tom_Hacker"></a> NEES Results- Tom Hacker </h3>
Gabriele answered question of how we provision movement of data:- a two stage process, getting data back to submit host to a person’s PC, initiated by user, workflow driven by limitations we have (Capability we’re developing now, issue Globus online) PC is windows, had to move to Linux to make earthquake simulation work properly.
<p />
Ruth- Get Purdue to embrace as IT facility and campus grid, talked to people at various groups, goal to make connection again.
<p />
Questions: Data management- greatest challenge with OSG. Do we have regulation to protect PC of NEES scientist who has uploaded data? How do we provision movement of data?
<p />
