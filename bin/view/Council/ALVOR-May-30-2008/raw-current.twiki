---+++ Agenda/Minutes:

   * *NYSGrid:*
      * NYSGrid is made up of 19 institutions, mostly higher education, but also Brookhaven. They are very diverse, not focusing on any discipline. They focus is to support the region, foster collaboration and facilitate success. Their VO has been around for about 2 years, but formal organization occurred about 1.5 years ago. They have two large Blue Gene Systems. They are looking for a much simplified way to establish accounts and find the current mechanisms difficult and complex. They have identified one persion at Buffalo with a technical background whose responsibility is to stay in touch with the OSG. They have found this to be very important and even critical to assuring the needed communications are leading to success. They have some success stories and are eager to have more.

   * *Georgetown:*
      * Georgetown&#39;s principle point man for contacts with scientist is there system administrator, David Cafaro. Primarily have been working with chemist but have biologist in the works. Recent OSG Grid School at Georgetown increased local interest, but they are just about to finish up their infrastructure. They have been trying to join other VOs in an attempt to facilitate being able to run jobs on the OSG. There is some confusion with how to run jobs on other OSG resources. Kent walked them through VOMS and VO registrations, then discussed VORS and specific details surrounding site policies for allowing other VOs to run on resources they do not own.  They currently view their focus disciplines as computational groups within biology and chemistry. They expect to evolve and may reorganize into a multiple VO model at Georgetown, but for now they would like to be viewed as a single Georgetown VO. Life Sciences will be a big part of their future direction. They registered as a VO in September 2006. Currently GT is in a &quot;reactive&quot; state to provide computational resources to their user communities. They are very good at setting up clusters but have only a few hours a week to think about &quot;proactive&quot; thoughts like participation in the OSG and enabling users in this arena. They are struggling with finding a way to enable more time for being &quot;proactive&quot;. Additional funds would facilitate this. The find that the OSG documentation (as viewed by a new VO) are not laid out well. They see a need for easy entry points that a complete perspective of what a new person needs to know - current layout is piece mill requiring lots of hopping around with some insight into what you are looking for next. The were unaware until this meeting that as a VO they could actually run jobs on other OSG resources. They believe that the problems they have experiences will be very typical for other VOs similar in size to theirs. Regarding communications to the council, an open email channel or possibly a once every year or two meeting with the council might be useful. They expect to more fully take advantage of the Operations Teleconferences in the future. Stated that this telephone conversation has done more for GT than any other meeting in the past year. It was also noted that a mentor VO or other body could be of great help to a new VO.

   * *NWICG:*
      * They are made of of three institutions (all higher education) in north western Indiana. They have a diverse collection of resources (large clusters, condor pools, high memory machines and just bringing up FPGA system). As a grid, they also participate in OSG and TeraGrid. Their focus is on supporting their region, with no specific science focuses. They distribute their resources, infrastructure and user communities among the campuses. The are not really sure how to make their VO participation in the OSG more effective. They have been highly focused on getting their resources up and running for their user communities to date. Their users are not using the OSG so much, but they do see OSG jobs from other VOs coming their way. They are struggling (as are most grids) with getting their user communities onto grid resources. Not sure how communications with Council would help at this point. They have been regularly active participants in the definition of functionality for the OSG software stack.

&lt;font color=red&gt;
   * *Feedback from question to all that were still on the call at the end: &quot;Do you feel the current design for having two &quot;at-large&quot; VOs with seats on the council for two year terms would meet the needs of your VO?*
      * Shorter terms might work better (maybe one year appointments).
      * Rotation of appointments among the at-large VOs as part of these shorter terms to assure all voices are heard at a reasonable frequency
      * Pre-meeting before the Council meetings by the at-large VOs (or some membership from within) to coordinate issues and recommendations
      * Concern that there are a wide variety of VO classes, regional grids, big experiments, focus scientific disciplines, etc; Need a way to get the wide range of view points heard in council
&lt;/font&gt;
