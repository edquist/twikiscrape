---+++ Draft Charter 


 
A sub-committee of the Open Science Grid Consortium Council is asked to write a proposal for the Consortium’s strategic goals for industry relationships and engagement over the next 5-10 years:
   * Clarify the goals, principles and approaches for the OSG Consortium&#39;s interactions with Commercial Organizations (where organizations covers physical and virtual organizations, as well as the individuals who are part of such organizations).
   * Make a proposal for the nature of Commercial Organizations with which OSG should engage.
   * Make a proposal for Commercial Organization activities and interactions useful for the OSG in 2020.
 
The scope should include:
   * Criteria for discussion with Commercial Organizations.
   * Articulation of benefits of working with Commercial Organizations.
   * Principles of, user potential to benefit from, and cost analyses for OSG purchasing access to resources available from Commercial Organizations on behalf of existing or future stakeholders.
   * Recommendation on a set of stakeholder interests, set of Commercial Organizations that the OSG could approach, as well as recommending some proposed activities.
   * Recommendation on whether OSG should change the current policy of not supporting users from Commercial Organizations nor applications from Commercial Organizations.
   * Recommendation on pursuit of Commercial Organizations to support other OSG production services (at the moment we will rely on DigiCert for certificate provisioning).
   * Specific attention to potential for OSG engagement in SBIR and STTR programs.
