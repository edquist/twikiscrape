---++ Key Activities
   * &lt;b&gt;Support for CCRC08 for ATLAS and CMS.&lt;/b&gt; OSG provided operational support for the sites and VOs as needed. Ruth is attending the CCRC Post Mortem workshop this week at CERN. Usage of OSG showed a peak during the CCRC08 challenges [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Usage_Stats][Usage Stats]]. We held a joint OSG-EGEE-WLCG design/blueprint meeting which kicked off planned activities for making the Client Tools offered by OSG more usable by the LHC experiments and a possible joint activity between EGEE/Shift and OSG on operations security checking tools.
&lt;br&gt;
   * &lt;b&gt;Security incident response:&lt;/b&gt;  Significant amount of effort to respond to the Debian week SSH key issue. Lots of coordination across EGEE/OSG and within the TAGPMA, iGTF. The response by the US CAs to checking issued certificates was very good. Lessons learned are to remind both Sites and VOs to communicate to the Security Team as soon as they are alerted to a vulnerability or possible incident.
&lt;br&gt;
   * &lt;b&gt;The Facility effort&lt;/b&gt; is mainly focused on the release of OSG V 1.0 which is expected in the next couple of days, and on the Site Availability milestone for the WLCG. OSG 1.0 includes the Resource and Service Availability (SRV) probes and infrastructure to meet the WLCG milestone for end-to-end reporting of the US Tier-2s. However, they are also being deployed in parallel on OSG 0.8.0 sites. We will be relying on continued cooperation from the US ATLAS and US CMS Tier-2s to deploy and operate these. Once V1.0 is released we will have a campaign to help sites and VOs upgrade. 
&lt;br&gt;
   * We held a &quot;6-weekly&quot; status and planning meeting between &lt;b&gt;LIGO and OSG&lt;/b&gt;. There has been a ramp up of Einstein@home use of OSG over the past month. There remains a need to have more deployments of WS-Gram for this, and, since the application initially ran on the DGrid infrastructure in Germany,  to debug specific OSG configurations that are different from theirs. There has been additional progress on the middleware to enable science out of the Inspiral Analysis application running on OSG. T
&lt;br&gt;
   * We will hold &lt;b&gt;4 quarterly stakeholder meetings in June: CDF, D0, ATLAS, CMS&lt;/b&gt;. More are planned for July. These are proving useful for identifying specific collaboration issues and tasks for OSG to follow up on.
&lt;br&gt;
   * &lt;b&gt;Grid schools&lt;/b&gt; were presented at the Clemson Campus Infrastructure Day, the HealthGrid conference in Chicago and the PASI workshop in Costa Rica. These had quite different audiences and we got different feedback from each. 
&lt;br&gt;
   * The annual &lt;b&gt;Users meeting&lt;/b&gt; is next week at BNL. There will be a discussion of the OSG WMS - Panda, GLideIns etc, the first training session for VO Security Contacts, a discussion on the challenges of maintaining customer interest in running on OSG from Engagement, among other things. There are currently 38 registrants.


---++ Planning for Year 3

The [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/pub/Management/20080605ETAgendaMinutes/OSG_Year3_Planning.pdf][Year 3 planning schedule and activities]] was presented to the Area Coordinators by Chander at last weeks meeting. We hope to have a fairly complete plan to present to the Council at the August face-to-face meeting. I am working with the stakeholders on the specific goals and plans of the science collaborations.

---+++ Resources
The OSG PEP shows a  planned ramp up in accessible resources (due to LHC, LIGO and other contributors) of 45% increase in CPU power and 38% increase in disk. If one compares this to the WLCG pledges for ATLAS and CMS there is a discrepancy:

&lt;img src=&quot;%ATTACHURLPATH%/Slide2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Slide2.gif&quot; width=&#39;500&#39; height=&#39;375&#39; /&gt;

 There are, however, significant increases which will test the scalability and robustness of OSG.  

---+++ Facility Availability and Performance
   * Ensure infrastructure meets [[http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/C-RRB/MoU/][WLCG MOU]] Tier-2  targets for operation:
       *  90% success in solving all WLCG MOU problems within 1 day (from CCRC08 Twiki

---+++ Specific Stakeholder Needs
This is mainly legacy from what we know in FY08. I need more input from you...
   * WLCG
      * Track and provide needed functionality in SEs through SRM implementations.
      * Provide, track and solve problems with site availability and accounting reports. 
      * Support LHC Tier-3 sites infrastructure as requested, 
      * Support CCRC&#39;09 - which is not yet defined; and other data challenges to be defined by ATLAS and CMS.
      * Job Throughput...
      * CPU usage..
      * data transfer...
   * LIGO 
      * Broad support for WS-GRAM on OSG sites. 
      * Better support for data placement and management.
   * STAR
      * support for virtual machine infrastructure on more OSG sites (currently only UofC TeraPort, also running on Amazon Cloud).
   * D0 
      * Improved efficiency and robustness of running Monte Carlo.
      * Sustaining the throughput of 3.4 M events/week in the time of LHC data taking.
   * CDF
      * Sustaining availability of resources in the time of LHC data taking.
