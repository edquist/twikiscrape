Dear Kent, Paul, Ruth, Richard, Jerome,

I have compiled our previous notes. We will bring the following for discussion today. It seems 
at that everybody in this group is in agreement now!

Personally I would like to encourage Kent and Paul to run for 2010 Chair election, and 
Ruth to run for 2011 ED.

Kind regards,

Piotr
