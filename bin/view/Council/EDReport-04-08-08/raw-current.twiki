Dear OSG Council,

Kent and Paul have asked that I continue sending reports to the Council, with a frequency of bi-weekly to match the Executive Team meetings, and I am happy to do so.

We are pleased to see that the use of the OSG infrastructure by the Engage and other non-physics VOs, as well as D0,  ramped up fairly smoothly during the period that ATLAS and CMS have been using fewer of the resources. The Engage use has increased to more than 30,000 CPUHours a day. We do not think a limit has been reached, but we have not tested it either. D0 was able to temporarily ramp up usage, but has run into some scalability issues which the experiment and OSG are working on together.

We have had four in the first round of quarterly meetings with our major scientific stakeholders that I am organizing towards better direct communication between the research communities and the OSG activities: We had a meeting with the CMS and ATLAS WLCG/Tier-1 managers (Ian and Michael), with D0, CDF and, just yesterday, with LIGO. We are currently setting up meetings with Nanohub and STAR. Each of the meetings to date has been very useful and generated follow up action items.

Finally, I attach the March report to members of the Joint Oversight Team giving a &quot;monthly measurement/metric&quot;.

with regards,

Ruth
