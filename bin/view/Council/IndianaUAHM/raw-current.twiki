---+ Indiana University OSG All Hands Meeting Proposal

Indiana University Research Technologies (IU RT) and OSG Operations propose hosting the next OSG All Hands Meeting in Indianapolis. IU&#39;s geographically central location and IU RT&#39;s close connection with OSG Operations and several strategic OSG partners organizations (XSEDE Campus Bridging, Internet2, CACR, ATLAS MWT2) makes it an ideal hosting institution. 

---++ Proposed Dates

Week of March 11th, 2013. Corresponding to Spring Break on the IUPUI campus. 

---++ Location

All meeting events will take place on the IUPUI campus, with the possible exception of receptions and dinners. This provides easy access to downtown Indianapolis and the Indianapolis airport. [[http://visit.iupui.edu/lodging/][Lodging]] is plentiful and campus is within walking distance of downtown [[http://visit.iupui.edu/trip/][events and attractions]]. 

---++ Facilities

To keep expenses reasonable, we will use IUPUI classroom and lecture facilities. The most likely location is at [[http://maps.google.com/maps?q=535+W.+Michigan+St.+Indianapolis+IN+46202-3103][ICTC]] (home of OSG Operations Offices and the Global Research Network Operations Center), but depending on booking other campus buildings may be used. 

---++ Program Notes

Initial thoughts are to keep the general time structure the same as the 2012 meetings, but we are open to suggestions. This would be three and one-half days of plenary or !BoF (ATLAS/CMS) sessions followed by one day of Council meetings on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. We should also take advantage of the local Internet2, XSEDE Campus Bridging, and CACR experts to provide networking, campus grid, and security sessions. OSG Operation&#39;s close work with EGI and WLCG Interoperability is another area to leverage for international input. 

Registration fees will remain the same as the 2012 AHM. Corporate sponsorship will be sought to host additional events including lunches, receptions, dinners, and other events. 

---+++ Local Planning Committee
   * Bill Barnett (Director, Science Community Tools)
   * Fred Luehring (Research Scientist, IU Phyiscs)
   * Therese Miller (Manager of Collaboration and Trash/Engagement for Research Technologies)
   * Rob Quick (Manager Distributed Operational Support and Engineering, OSG Operations Coordinator)

---+++ OSG Planning Committee

Will we seek volunteers from OSG to address the format, structure, and topics to be covered. 

---++ Terms and Conditions from Indiana University

Craig Stewart, Associate Dean of Research Technologies, has requested OSG underwrite the cost of the OSG All Hands Meeting should the meeting end in a negative financial position overall. From reviewing 2012 meeting finances, this condition is unlikely. Local planners will do everything possible to control expenses, secure sponsorship and collect registration fees to ensure this underwrite is not necessary.
