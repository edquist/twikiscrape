   * Since the Council face to face in August we have had a task forces working on :
      * Improving the throughput and usability of the LIGO Binary Inspiral applications
      * The Engage VO is  running  simulated 1 night of data collection for LSST using GlideinWMS, the front end at Nebraska, and supported by Fermilab Engage group. This consists of 500 pairs of focal plane images = 1000 images,  200,000 simulation jobs (1 chip at a time) and 1000 merging jobs.   This consists of 500 pairs of focal plane images = 1000 images,  200,000 simulation jobs (1 chip at a time) and 1000 merging jobs.  

   * The total throughput of OSG has reached new values due to the increase in usage by several non-physics VOs as well as the ramp up of LHC simulations and analysis.  The technical work has started that is  needed  to report ALICE USA accounting and reliability information through OSG to the WLCG. We are working with the WLCG to address issues of instability of the information services (BDII) at the CERN/WLCG side.

   * Working on submission of 1 year extension of OSG for HEP and NP offices by the end of October. Because of this unknown we are currently only writing Statements of Work for 6 months rather than the usual 12. We hope to more before the end of the year.  We are still not sure of the actual profile that OHEP are looking for here. 
 
   * Dan and MIron have submitted the  high throughput parallel computing OSG Satellite annual report to NSF. Several new applications are now running through OSG on several sites using MPI libraries transported with the applications to the executive nodes.

   * OSG -TG: OSG will be  contributing 0.1 FTE of  Jim Weichel as project management effort for Extenci. We are expending effort in ensuring that the applications from the University of Chicago can be well supported  on OSG. Chander attended the August TeraGrid quarterly meeting. He is starting to work with Tim Cockerall, the TeraGrid project manager, on regular reporting of our collaborative projects. 

   * The Software Institute to provide input to the NSF for their S2I2 program was attended by over 40 projects covering application communities relying on distributed computing, software provider communities, integration projects and “expert witnesses” from NSF, the Executive Director of Eclipse and a co-PI from the UK Software Sustainability Institute.

   * Miriam Boon: [[%ATTACHURL%/OSGReport100914.pdf][Report]] on the status of the new name for Isgtw, the new web site, and the need for sustained funding after Dec 2010
   * Robert Engel: Report on Contact Management status [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/20100909AgendaMinutes ][(Executive Team Report)]]
   * John McGee: Brief discussion of the iRODS/NERSC activity

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Ruth noted that DOE would be providing an extension spanning from March 2011 to March 2012.

Year 5 Statements of Work will have a 12 month work program, but cover 6 months of funding up front.

XD proposals (2) are being reviewed this week. Should know the outcome in a few weeks time.

Dan noted that the BDII isssue is lack of information at the moment. Instability was earlier in the year. .

Miriam was out sick and not available to present this month.

Robert provided overview of program of work and current activities under the Content Management project that he leads.

John McGee reported on the iRODS/NERSC activities. He is looking for a contact, Doug Olson agreed asked to be included in the communications for this. This is primarily an information gathering effort to understand the fit to OSG.

---+++ Status Report from OSG Council Co-Chairs

   * ExTenCI Kick-off Meeting Summary (Paul)

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Paul reported on a recent interest expressed by the NSF (Marv and Ed) for the next proposal to have an international component. This should have a federated structure. Ruth noted that this was a good opportunity to align various technologies such as software with the EU efforts. Marv remarked to Paul that this should tie in with LHC and LIGO. It should be possible to put together a good story for compatibility spanning the next 8 to 10 years involving LIGO and LHC.

Paul also reported on the progress being made on the Extenci project. There was a kick-off meeting the day after the August OSG Council Face-to-Face meeting. The kick-off meeting was well attended. A lot of effort has gone into pulling together the Statements of Work for the project. Paul expects to have these in place soon. There has been discussion on assuring closer coupling with the OSG and TG management. There will be regular reporting to the OSG Council.

---+++ Round-Table Virtual Organization Reports and Issues:

   * Reduced availability of OSG resources for Engage due to LHC ramp up and the &#39;expressed need for more resources accessible for OSG&quot;.

%BLUE% *minutes:*

LIGO reported by Kent, with details from Robert, that there has been a clear decline in the opportunistic usage of OSG for Einstein@Home on the OSG. Robert reported that the throughput is down to about 10% on a weekly average from where it was about two months ago. Brian reported that this is due primarily to MC runs and should pick back up once this is over. There is a significant increase in the number of CPU-HRS being utilized on the OSG. Others asked if this would drop back down after the MC running has finished, and if so, would this be an indication that there are significant under used cycles that are not being made available for others to use. Production will watch this in the next few months to develop a better understanding. John reported that something similar has been seen by Engage, but they have in combination a submission issue that make concrete statements difficult to make at this time. Brian reported that from HTC&#39;s point of view there has been a similar drop - they are seeing about half the cpu-hrs under this heavy fill-time MC run as they did previously. Brad reported that D0 hasn&#39;t noted a significant change

Rick reported that CDF has recently started  reprocessing about half their data set. This is about 10x larger than anything they have attempted before. They will rely on their own resources and a new site in Korea which has ~250 slots with plans to grow to 1000 slots. This new site in Korea is using the OSG software stack. The plan is to complete the reprocessing in about half a year. HTC offered to support CDF in this effort and Brian and Rick will talk offline about how to move forward.

Brad Abbott provided this follow-on report on September 23rd:

Hi Paul and Kent,

 At the last OSG meeting, there was a discussion about V0&#39;s getting
 access to OSG machines and the loss of opportunistic computing.
 At D0, we didn&#39;t see too many losses, but I did a little more
 digging

 From Joel Snow who does the day-to-day processing on OSG:

 Looking at the Gratia wall hours of all my jobs gives an idea of
what the slot usage is.

period                                   total wall hours of MC prod jobs
2010-09-13 - 2010-09-19 (inclusive)      290420.0
2010-09-06 - 2010-09-12 (inclusive)      355380.9
2010-07-26 - 2010-08-01 (inclusive)      516381.8
2010-05-17 - 2010-05-23 (inclusive)      449026.2
2010-05-03 - 2010-05-09 (inclusive)      407627.1
2010-04-19 - 2010-04-25 (inclusive)      361206.1
2010-04-12 - 2010-04-18 (inclusive)      327002.7

This is just data that I had handy.  I think it shows available slots have come down significantly from the peak to levels seen
about 5 months ago when we were using a little fewer sites and efficiency was not quite as good.  Efficiency improvements
account for events being about the same while wall hours have declined. Watching OSG queues I see times much more often now
when we have few to no jobs running with many in the queue at many opportunistic sites.


Cheers,
Brad
