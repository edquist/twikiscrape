%BLUE% *minutes:*
Ruth asked that Rob Quick be asked to present on LHC operations and ticketing at next month&#39;s council meeting. Details of her presentation are in the report.

John McGee reported that there have been issues from the TG user community regarding TG ticketing

Chander&#39;s report on satellite proposals calls out type 3 &amp; 4 as being interfaced with the council. There were several questions regarding this on how this would operationally and procedurally be viewed to happen. Would the effort exist in the council? Would delegation to the project be exercised as in the past. In general the document was agreed to be very useful and only need to spell out some of the operational aspects, particularly where the council interface was defined.

Jim gave an overview of the science domain usage. There is a definite increase in non-HEP and non-physices usage. Paul reported this to be about double where it was in the past. This is a very hands on process and expected to happen once a year. Would be good to have charts that pull out all physics, as well as pulling out the major stakeholders.

---+++ Status Report from OSG Council Co-Chairs

   * Doodle Poll for Assigning dates for August OSG Council Face-to-Face Meeting
      * [[http://www.doodle.com/zykgavkaz4dtx7vn][URL for Doodle Poll]]

   * Update on !ExTENCI: Extending Science Through Enhanced National Cyberinfrastructure

Funded for first year at roughly $1M. Looking for early success story. Will leverage applications work involving engage and pegasus (and possibly others) to assure this early milestone. Concern expressed over the use of existing personnel to leverage in the margins and our relative scale to TG for being able to do this in a competitive way. Also noted that the purchase of SUN by ORACLE has an unknown implication to the Lustre component.

Poll is up. Need more participation to pick date. Venue will be FNAL.

---+++ Status Report for Pending Action Items from March Face-to-Face Council Meeting

1. *Paul Avery*; Communicate with Ian regarding Globus Alliance position on Council.

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Paul is awaiting feedback from Ian.

 2. *Shaowen Wang &amp; Doug Olson*; Develop and document a process for removing a council representative on the basis of participation. This should include an &quot;inactive state&quot;, which also has a process for returning to &quot;active status&quot; based on the procedures to be developed and documented. This process should be reviewed by the council before ratification.

%BLUE% *minutes:*

A draft has been generated and will be circulated via email to the council.

 3. *Ruth Pordes, John McGee &amp; Piotr Sliz*; Develop a document covering &quot;expectations&quot; for coming into the OSG. Collective VO representatives reported that there were lots of questions regarding how to interact with the funding agencies as a member of the OSG. One example VO was noted as SBGrid in the discussion.

See Ruth&#39;s ED report.

 4. *Chander Sehgal*; Find out the end data for SciDAC II

&lt;verbatim&gt;

Regarding action item 4, I believe the end-date for Scidac-2 is &quot;mid-2011&quot; based on 

http://www.er.doe.gov/ASCR/News/NewsSciDAC-2.html

If a more precise date is needed, I can try to contact our program officers.

Thanks,
Chander

---+++ Round-Table Virtual Organization Reports and Issues:

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Brad Abbott (D0): Everything is running smoothly for D0 with no major issues. MC production has been roughly constant of 10 million events/day from OSG.  Now that we have LCG running (thanks to OSG) we are getting ~ 4 million events/week from LCG.

Tom Furlani (Collective VOs): Collective VO Representatives need a better way to to collect information from stakeholders. The weekly meetings held by Abhishek are focused on current technical challenges and not giving a strategic look at the needs and feedback for planning for the future. A suggestion to have a monthly meeting with leadership was made by Tom. Abhishek said he would be willing to meet with Tom and Shaowen on a monthly bases to give a synthesized few from the &quot;field&quot;. This may need further inputs from VO leadership. Abhishek reported that he has held these types of meetings in the past. Abhishek provided this [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/SummarytoCouncil_04132010 ][link]] to a quarterly summary.
