---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Problem of data being lost in BDII is under investigation. Burt to see if he can add the symptomatic Atlas sites to his ganglia metric query, or provide query code for Atlas to use. (Xin, Burt)
   * SRM problem at LIGO will require separate proxies for OSG and LIGO internal. Brian has send an update to Britta on how to make this work.
   * Slow data transfers at LIGO have been significantly improved (Britta, Brian).
   * Meeting is being set up for next week to meet with SBGrid on scaling direction. (Abhishek, Dan)

---++ Attendees:
   * John M., Xin, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 105 khour/day, 80% success. CPU/wallclock at 69%.
   * Storage: Tier 1 transferred .8 PB last week (peak of 260 TB/day).
   * OSG: Nearly all at 1.2 (Purdue, FNAL, and some T3s at 1.0)
   * LHC ramped up beam energy to 1.2 TeV.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * LHC set new energy record, accelerate proton beam to 1.18Tev. 
   * General production status : During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 6-7K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. 
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 955K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 945K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 144K jobs per day
         * failed 112K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 89%,  walltime - 96%
   * Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites, under investigation by GIP and CERN experts. 

---++ LIGO (Britta)

   * Working on new pilots for Panda ITB project
   * Looking at a new VDT release late this week/early next week


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.4
      * 41 OSG 1.2.X resources (3 are 1.2.4)
      * 21 OSG 1.0.X resources (12 are 1.0.4)                                                                                                                                                                  
      * 22 OSG 1.0.0
      * 2 OSG 0.8.0 
         * OU_OCHEP_SWT2, tier2-01.ochep.ou.edu , Contact: Horst Severini

---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Engage (John, Chris)
   * two users active with large runs: one we had known about (Rosetta), and the re-emergence of Jinbo Xu with Raptor (http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1001497). 
   * We are scheduling a call with Dr. Xu for later this week for two purposes: 1) gauge the anticipated upcoming capacity requirements; 2) his recent request to create his own science gateway backed up by OSG.
   * The Engage Submit host has been having some high load issues which Chris Bizon is investigating. Engage was getting very good throughput (order of 4k jobs sustained), but this has recently dropped down to 1k jobs.
   * From Chris Green
      *Geant4.
         * Ramping up to start validation for 2009-12 release. Non-OSG-specific technical problems have slowed things down a little. OSG-specific problem of difficulty of identifying which sites are RH4 vs RH5 worker nodes and the Geant4-specific requirement of non-standard GCC version for SL5 were a hurdle, but we now have a scheme and are distributing an RH5-x86-64 application set. Tests on same will proceed tomorrow.
      * LSSD.
         * Initial contacts made by Mats renewed. Face-to-face meeting with Ian Shipsey scheduled for tomorrow.
      * Fly&#39;s Eye.
         * Informal inquiries suggest 20TB will be available without trouble. Following a &quot;formal&quot; request procedure within OSG to iron out a workable procedure going forward. Tentative scheme for transferring data to SE and accessing same for analysis has been arrived at; discussions with Fly&#39;s Eye contact ramping back up.
      * Fusion/TGYRO.
         * Some problems getting specific compiles for some OSG sites. Will continue working on specifics for TGYRO on MPI-capable OSG sites and trying to work towards a scalable generic solution for MPI build / install / run on OSG.
