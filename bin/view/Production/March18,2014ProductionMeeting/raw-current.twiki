---++ Software (Tim C.)
(From Mats Selmeci)

We will be making an emergency release of the 3.2 series next Tuesday (3/25).

This is due to severe issues with Globus job manager crashing that was reported by several sites. The known sites with this problem are: University of Michigan, University of Florida, and USCMS Tier 1 (last night).
This issue only affects the latest 3.2 series of OSG-Software. We have a fix ready in the testing repositories.

The symptom of the problem is that the &quot;globus-job-manager&quot; process repeatedly segfaults and crashes; new jobs may not get created, and /var/lib/globus on the CEs may get filled up with broken state files.
If a site is affected, they are encouraged to update the &quot;globus-gram-job-manager&quot; package from the osg-testing repositories.
They may also downgrade their globus-gram-job-manager package to the previous version if they are not comfortable with installing from the osg-testing repos; however, the three sites I mentioned above have not had any problems with the new version and reported that it fixed their issues.

The precipitating cause of the problem is a globus-job-manager process crashing or getting killed while it is in a critical section of the code. (This results in the creation of a broken state file, which future invocations of globus-job-manager will try to read, fail, and themselves crash). This is not very likely on a site that isn&#39;t heavily loaded, which may explain why we did not catch the issue in testing.

We are keeping track of this in the JIRA ticket SOFTWARE-1418 (https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1418).

---++ User Support (Chander, Bo)

Engage VO wrap-up is proceeding; last week they were down to &lt;100 hours used.

UCSD submit host is now operating as a front-end using vo=osg credentials.

Duke users of Engage VO have been migrated to OSG-XD submit host.

In the last 14 days, OSG VO usage has averaged ~221K hours per day.
