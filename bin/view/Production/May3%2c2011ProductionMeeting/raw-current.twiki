-- Main.DanFraser - 08 Apr 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * ATLAS recovered well from problems related to the CERN VOMS update that caused a hiccup early last week.
   * Changes to ReSS IP information may need CEMon (Tomcat) Restart for resources still at version 1.0.x of OSG. Marco will update the agenda with the 1.0.x resource names. 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Xin, Armen, Britta, Suchandra, Marco, Rob Q., Mine
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC continues its successful run. In the process of increasing number of bunches and instantaneous luminosity. At moment 768 bunches per beam. Integrated luminosity for ATLAS is now ~270pb-1 (110 up since the last week).
      * US ATLAS production was quite stable at the average level of about 10-12k running jobs, mostly simulation. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.0M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 148K jobs per day
         * failed 71K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%, walltime - 97%
      * Panda jobs processed, as reported by Panda monitor, on USATLAS sites:
         * 620K panda jobs processed for last week. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * HCC opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: general agreement reached, implementation details (group quota) are in work progress at BNL.
      * LIGO jobs excessively accessing BNL srm server caused problems.
         * opportunistic VOs need to be prepared for massive preemption 
         * resource owners need to be prepared to stop new connections if needed 
      * ATLAS asks for updating LFC packages in VDT/OSG client.  Met with VDT last week to flesh out details.

      * TWiki and OIM were unavailable during this time. 
      * Unused network card in main machine room switch was pulled causing the switch to stop responding. (This has been done previously with no affect.)

   * Will be modifying format of data to be sent to SAM

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.19
      *       95 (11) OSG 1.2.X resources (      21 are 1.2.19)
      *        3 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        0 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        0 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
Site Coordination meeting next week

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Chander)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * No new vulnerabilities/incidents. It is still unclear if the Incident at Oak Ridge lab has affected TeraGrid resources. If so it may affect OSG users who have access to TG. 
   * Received a request from EGI/WLCG security team for a joint incident drill (SSC5). We had another joint incident drill involving tier1s couple years ago. This one seems to involve only Atlas job submission framework and some select sites -- not all the production sites. I will need to get more information on what is tested, which sites are targeted, whether our production sites are willing to participate, and given all these plans, whether security team has sufficient effort to plan, prepare and conduct the drill in OSG. European target dates are to start on May 23rd and end on May 29th.
