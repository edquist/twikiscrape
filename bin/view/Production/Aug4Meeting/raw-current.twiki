---+++ Attendees : 
   * Rob S., Rik, Tanya, Jim, Marco, Dan
---+++ Notes:
   * Next meeting in late August.
   * Atlas Notes:
      * Funding is starting to trickle down to the T3s.
      * The &quot;inventory&quot; capability in Xrootd is not really functional for Atlas T3s. New changes have been proposed by the developers. These could affect the OSG documentation and configuration scripts for the Asoka deployment tool for Xrootd. Atlas is still pulling together the data requirements for Xrootd and will keep OSG informed. 
      * Also Atlas is looking at external tools to e.g. PQ2 help manage inventory in Xrootd. 
      * There is discussion of an Atlas wide packaging of Xrootd that could be different than the T3 deployment used by Asoka. Depending on how the politics around this evolves, Atlas could have new requests for OSG such as Native Packaging for Xrootd.
      * There is planned testing of DQ2/FTS data scaling between the T2s and T3s that will pick up in Sep.
   * CMS Notes:
      * There is a combined OSG Admin/CMS Tier 3 workshop at Vanderbilt Aug 10-12. Details are at: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/SiteCoordination/SitesCoord100804.
      * CMS is moving folks to a centralized version of Phedex for data transfers. Sites include: FSU, Princeton, UCLA, Mississippi, Texas A&amp;M. 
      * Brian B. is working with CMS to explore the Wide Area Network use of Xrootd. Test deployments are planned at Nebraska and UC Riverside. If successful, this could greatly simplify the data management problem. Rik noted that Atlas is also involved in this consortium. 
   * OSG
      * The ability to register sites with only an SE (with BeStMan) has been successfully tested and will be moved into production next week. 
      * The Asoka package for T3 deployment has been successfully tested at ANL and is ready for new Atlas sites to start using it.
      * OSG Admin meeting mentioned above.
