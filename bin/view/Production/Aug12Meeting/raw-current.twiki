-- Main.DanFraser - 12 Aug 2009
---++ Significant/Action Items:
   * Next meeting is targeted for Aug 26, next week is the Atlas T3 meeting
   * Documentation needed for cluster management solutions (Marco/Dan/Alina?)
   * Rob to connect with one of Tanya&#39;s SEs (and run STEP09 tests) for file system comparisons (Rob/Tanya)
   * System Admin meeting was a success (5-6 T3s each from Atlas and CMS)

---++ Attendees: 
   * Rob S.,Tanya, Marco, Dan

---++ Notes:
   * Rob S upgraded his CE to 1.2 (at the conference)
      * CRAB was working on 1.1, now needs to make sure this works under 1.2
      * Plan to connect with one of Tanya&#39;s SE&#39;s and run STEP09 for filesystem comparisons
      * Plan to add additional worker nodes on the CE and needs recommended docs for configuration
   * Tanya has four SEs available to test
      * BeStMan + NFS, + Hadoop, + XROOTD,  +  dCache
   * Dan discussed the role of OSG in supporting T3s
      * OSG to add support for cluster configurations (previously OSG stack assumed a cluster already installed)
      * OSG exploring ways to build a social networking environment for T3s to get help and help themselves
      * OSG to add security docs and support for T3s (partially completed and used at the Sys Admin meeting)
      * OSG will not provide VM support at this time since this is outside of our expertise
   * It became apparent that there is no clear documentation on how to set up clusters for CMS or Atlas
      * Since some successful sites are using a ROCKS deployment, one config using ROCKS + Condor would be helpful
      * Also a guide for installing a Condor cluster directly from the VDT stack (?) would be helpful
      * Plan to find/develop these docs (Rob S agreed to help test when this is done)
   * Notes from Doug B. (via email)
      * Work continues on making VM&#39;s that contain Tier 3 services (condor, gridftp, xrootd, Bestman gateway etc).  
      * Our baseline is Xen Hypervisor and VMWare hypervisor.
      * the VM&#39;s will be SL 5.3 64bit and OS included in CERN VM. 
      * We have agreed to use the OSG/VDT cache&#39;s, Atlas code repositories and CERN VM cache&#39;s.
