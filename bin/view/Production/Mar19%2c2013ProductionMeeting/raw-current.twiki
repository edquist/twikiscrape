---++ Action/Significant Items:

   * It was mentioned that while we have CE version numbers, we do not keep track of versions for SE, WN, GUMS, etc. This information is necessary to assess transitions such as the Pacman deprecation. Rob, Tim, and Marco will follow up with possible solutions in a email conversation later this week.
   * CMS interested in how OASIS will be brought into the environment, and how current instances of CVMFS will operate (if at all) with the new OSG service.
   * ATLAS is watching the OSG Non-Root WN-Client install closely, to prepare for upcoming transition. More in software section of this report.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.15 / 1.2.32
      *       70 (4) OSG 3.x (      13 are 3.1.15)
      *       36 (-1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.32)

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

UNKNOWN VO is showing again in !GratiaWeb; this is a problem and I have opened a GOC ticket. Also there is a request from the OSG PI to scrub this out of the official usage reporting visible via !GratiaWeb, Usage Display, etc. 

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * One incident reported by OSG-XSEDE resources. Turned out to be harmless. Also impacts XSEDE resources. Reported to XSEDE, there is a suspicion of whether the user&#39;s XSEDE account is compromised. We found no effect on OSG resources. 
   * Operations
      * Possible delay in SHA-2 transition. IGTF is considering pushing the deadline to October 2013. My response was positive. Please let me know if you have feedback. 
      * OSG PKI Transition: Happening this weekend. We should send out one more announcement to OSG community that this is the last week to get DOEgrids certs. 
      * Bunch of new requests from PKI project gathered at AHM. Please send them to the PKI project if you have needs. 
      * Oasis/CVMFS security review is scheduled to finish this week. Thanks to GOC staff at AHM we gathered a lot of information.
