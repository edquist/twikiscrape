---++ User Support (Chander, Bo)

!GlueX is undertaking a data challenge and has asked for support in getting enough access to opportunistic cycles over the next few weeks – we are working to get details of the need.  Marko Slyz will support Richard Jones in this matter.

Production via vo=osg continues smoothly averaging ~230K hours per day for last 2 weeks.

We will try again to increase vo=osg production at Purdue; Bo will contact Kim Dillman on this matter.
