---++ Significant/Action Items:
   * Iowa State is shutting down their OSG operations, plan to find out more (Abhishek,Dan)
   * The Gridmap entry for LIGO was somehow lost at U Michigan. Britta trying to figure out what happened.
   * Some of the nanoHub material they were  planning to present at the NSF review is misleading with respect to OSG; need to monitor closely and follow up after their review. (Abhishek)
   * On the positive side Burt noted that CMS Tier 1 has been transitioned to an OSG site only
   * Also STEP09 tests were successful. More data should be available when analyzed (Xin, Burt)
   * Gold stars for Atlas/CMS T1s on their security drill. 

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Britta, Mats, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Arvind, Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * CMS ran about 240 khour/day last week with 91% success.   CPU/Wallclock is 80%.  
   * STEP09 is done.  Many goals were fulfilled.  Glidein production achieved 10k running jobs out of a single factory.  Some questions were raised that we are now trying to understand -- understanding how fast we could read and write from MSS, for example.  We&#39;re still working on the post-mortem.  Also, analysis efforts via glideinWMS continues as a separate non-coordinated scale test.
   * CMS Tier 1 is now transitioned to an OSG site only. 
---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 0.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 76%
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 773,270 managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs
         * average  ~110,467 jobs per day
         * failed 183,338 jobs
         * average efficiency: 81% for jobs and 96% for walltime

   * STEP09 status
      * Step09 active operations stopped last Friday evening, with backlog cleaned by Sunday, June 14. Quite a successful run, no major problems. US cloud was quite stable. Production was always at the level of 6-7k running jobs. Results of the run are being analyzed. Details after post mortem on July 1.

   * 42846.8 wall clock hours total (39445.9 / 3400.9 = 92.1% success)
   * Production issue with a user not specifying correct memory requirements for his jobs. Led to segfaults and lower job success rates.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

D0 MC rate dropped, causes are internal to D0; being watched closely.

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)
   * *RSV central availability calculation rolled back* Central availability metric retrieval was rolled back for any resources owned by CMS or ATLAS VOs. Issue being discussed offline by Chander/Dan/RobQ/Ken B/et al. offline
   * *ATLAS and CMS SEs in OIM* ATLAS and CMS are close to completing their registration of traditionally unregistered resources into OIM. This will enable them to remove these resources from the EGEE registration DB, and have everything within the OSG
   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/06/myosg-14-released.html][MyOSG 1.4 released]]*

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Security drill results are graded. Both tier-1 sites received 100 plus bonus points. Results are sent to the site contacts, OSG EB and Grid Deployment Board. 
   * A drill over Tier-2 sites are planned in August, either before or after the site admins meeting
