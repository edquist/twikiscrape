---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Last week, we (with help from Production) assisted GLOW in adding some sites to reach higher production levels; in addition, the glidein factory identified and resolved a couple of issue affecting this production.  As of late last week, GLOW was running about 60K hours per day and servicing their work queues effectively.  See http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/vo?vo=glow  .  GLOW identified some items affecting the movement of data with their jobs; halted production briefly;  and resolved those issues and is back to production. (Chander)
   * As part of this we identified the need to have pro-active monitoring of production in OSG enabled by all the glideinWMS front-end.  We will start to identify the needed reports and graphs  (with the glideinWMS project) and put processes in-place to pro-actively detect production issues and offer help to VOs. (Chander)
   * HTPC and Campus Grids are important items moving forward for OSG. A section for these will be added to the Production call. (Dan)
   * Happy Valentines Day!

---++ CMS (Burt / Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 16,886 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~267 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC decision to go to 4TeV/beam this year, bunch spacing stays same. Planned luminosity grow 3 times, expected 15fb-1 per experiment for this year (last year was 5fb-1 collected). Also during the year carry out testing and preparation for the much higher energy, higher luminosity, shorter bunch spacing for the after long shutdown run.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was not very stable, at the average level of ~8K running jobs, mainly simulation type. The reason is that the bulk production which was keeping the production at high and stable level during the last months is almost done. Still some new requests are arriving. Final validation of MC12 production with 4TeV/beam is almost done. That production will re-simulate all the MC data, will start in 1-2 weeks.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 82%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 920K
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200~350TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues

---++ Campus HTC Infrastructures and HTPC (Dan)
   * There have been some issues with HTPC at Purdue, OU, and Clemson. Working with Greg T. to actively debug these.
   * Virginia Tech has agreed to talk at the OSG AHM in March about his campus grid work so far. It is especially interesting since he is using HTPC as part of his Campus Infrastructure. He has been engaged with Derek this week in tweaking his configuration for additional testing. 
   * Detailed program plans are being developed for both Campus and HTPC programs.
   * CMS has expressed an interest in testing HTPC on the OSG. We are actively following up.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
