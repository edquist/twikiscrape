---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * LHC collisions at injection energy at all interaction regions!
   * T2 sites disappearing from CERN BDII, but still available in interop BDII (Xin, ticket #7772)
   * Need a list of open tickets impacting production from Atlas and CMS (Xin, Armen, Burt)
   * Ongoing SRM problem at LIGO now identified as an RFC proxy and SRMCP incompatibility. What are next steps? (Britta, Brian)
   * Need to schedule a meeting with SBGrid to understand future scaling requirements (Abhishek, Dan)
   * Need a list of anticipated requirements from the VOs and Engage (Abhishek, John M.)                                                 

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 155 khour/day, 89% success. CPU/wallclock at 60% (excluding FNAL: 68%).  I haven&#39;t dug into this yet.
   * Storage: Tier 1 transferred 2.2 PB last week (peak of 450 TB/day).  Problems discovered and fixed with CERN-&gt;FNAL transfers.
   * OSG: now have 10 T2 CEs at OSG 1.2 (All T1 and T2 but Purdue @ FNAL). All Tier 3s at 1.2.
   * Collisions at injection energy at all interaction regions!

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * ATLAS collision event : http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/public/EVTDISPLAY/events.html, data distribution to US T1/T2 is going smoothly.
   * User Analysis Test (UAT) post-mortem : 
   * General production status : During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 6-7K running jobs.
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 853K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 92%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 905K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 129K jobs per day
         * failed 76K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 96%
   * Status of work to include ATLAS OSG sites downtime info to the general ATLAS downtime page : on-going
   * All USATLAS T2s have published their SE info to interop BDII, with some help from GOC and OSG GIP folks.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.4 - NEW!
      * 42 OSG 1.2.X resources (4 are 1.2.4)
      * 21 OSG 1.0.X resources (12 are 1.0.4)

---++ Metrics (Brian)

   * Metrics is working full-steam on the new &quot;OSG Display&quot; for the DOE.
      * Hence, production related activities (such as the naming convention alignment) are taking a bit of a rest.  Will probably pick back up after the holidays.
   * Monthly eJOT reports are about to go out (tomorrow).  Everything looks good.
   * Have transferred the t2.unl.edu applications to a GOC dev webserver.  There are some tweaks needed, but hopefully this means we can roll this out soon (again, progress on this will depend on the OSG Display progress).

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Carried over* - low priority item: GOC will be removing www.grid.iu.edu, and redirecting it to Operations blog instead. 
      * Stalled - need to find a spot for ticket reports before we can complete this move
         * GOCTicket would be an ideal location
   * *Production Release Tuesday Nov 24th*: [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/11/goc-itb-release-notes-10-17-2009.html][Scheduled Release]] of OIM 2.10, !MyOSG 1.11, Ticket 1.10.

---+++ WLCG Ops
   * CERN LHC VOMS Service was unavailable for 20 minutes. Monday 16:02 -&gt; 16:21 UTC there was complete unavailability of the voms service. Cause was a misconfiguration of the gd lcg-fw service. Service restored after automatic notification to service manager. 


---++ Security (Mine)
   * LIGO&#39;s debian CA package request. Security team finished developing/implementing package creation. 
       * will be tested next week. Dec 1st is a new IGTF CA release. 
   * Anand has downloaded new VDT and could not find edg-mkgridmap file cron job. maybe it is our mistake... but we will try installing the new package again
   * CMS production sent a list of comments on ca management and RSV probes. We re-generated and debugged the problems with them
   * new vulnerabilities but not high level risk. We are testing pakiti (vulneraility monitoring tool developed by EGEE) to whether use in OSG
