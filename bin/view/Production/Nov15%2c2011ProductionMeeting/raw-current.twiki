      * Monitoring progress, no issues
   * LIGO decided against utilizing OSG glidein factory
      * Due to root installation needed at LIGO - Brian will send Glide In WMS non-root configuration. 
      * Will continue with local glidein factory

      * The situation of expired CRL at NECTEC CA is because the CA responsible is not able to regenerate CRL because of the electricity problem by flood in Bangkok. Suriya, the person in charge of NECTEC CA,  who was not able to estimate the schedule of recovery on last Friday. APROC was informed by NECTEC that their site planned to shutdown until end of November last week. Hope to get NECTEC update in the following days.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.25
      *       99 (13) OSG 1.2.X resources (      18 are 1.2.25)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources

---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Operational Security
      * No urgent issues. 
      * Some vulnerabilities released about twiki. Will report it to GOC. 
      * Gratia vulnerability is released. 2-3 people asked questions on how to apply the fix. 
      * Some new change requests coming from DOEgrids. Doegrids just opened a ticket today
      
   * DigiCert testing in ITB
      * Got all the new certificates for the participating ITB sites.  Created a new CA bundle and put in osg-testing repo. Still has work to do before starting the tests. We have good coverage of sites right now. 
   * CA release process. This issue is about our routine CA release process, unrelated to DigiCert or other changes. We are working with VDT and GOC to understand how our existing release process should work with the new VDT build structure.
