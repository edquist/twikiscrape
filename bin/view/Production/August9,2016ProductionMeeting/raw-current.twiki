---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status. 
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was stable most of the time, at the average level of 40-60K running job slots, with not enough tasks to keep the production full all the time.      
   * Job statistics for last week.     
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilots, 5M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 77% (for single core jobs)
      * 1.5M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  

---++ FIFE - !Fabric for Frontier Experiments (Tanya)
   * Very low OSG usage, still in the conference mode (411K Wall Hours for NOvA during last two weeks).
   * Next week will be able to submit to Stampede and OSC, requires glidinwms upgrade.

&lt;!-- ---++ Networking (Shawn) --&gt;

---++ Production Support (Ken)

 * Starting to get CENF (at CERN) set up as an OSG site for DUNE/protoDUNE. It&#39;s a 350-node/16 cores per node cluster running CERN CentOS 7 that&#39;s intended for use by DUNE and protoDUNE. They already have HTCondor and CVMFS installed, so I&#39;ll work with them to get the OSG CE and factory entries set up. They will initially use the Fermilab fifebatch frontend for job submission and gradually expand to other places.
