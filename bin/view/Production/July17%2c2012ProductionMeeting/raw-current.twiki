-- Main.DanFraser - 10 Jul 2012
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Large build up of proxy files in /tmp from UCSD reported RCAC (Purdue?) Glide In Service. This brought down the BNL CE. Rob will contact Jeff to see if anything can be done about this at the Factory or if it needs to be addressed at job submission. 
   * GT5 issues with CMS glidein jobs being put into &quot;Hold&quot; status is being researched by Jeff, Igor, and Jamie. Details under Operations section.

---++ Attendees:
   * Rob Q, Tony, Armen, Mine, Alain, Xin
 
---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 10,658 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~467 TB/day


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * Most of the last week LHC was doing machine developments. Back to normal collisions and physics run on Saturday. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~7.2 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 20K running jobs, until Sunday, when it dropped everywhere in ATLAS. The reason was that the last software release got delayed in validation and was not deployed on cvmfs. Now the production rate is recovering. Most of the jobs are simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.0M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 350TB/day at BNL T1. Missing data since last Friday is being recovered. 
   * Issues

   * Release of [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/07/osg-software-version-316-has-been.html][OSG 3.1.6]]
      * A bug has been fixed that was introduced in RSV 3.7.2 installations that affected the use of user proxies
      * The RSV log rotation configuration has been adjusted to not affect global log rotation behavior 
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Kernel updates on all OSG services were transparent
      * Fermi Grid at 30% load shed today due to hot weather
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Last week on Monday glideins from all gt5 sites went held again for CERN CMS Frontend glideins only between 8 and 9 am (PT) on all 3 factories:
         * Globus error 79: connecting to the job manager failed.  Possible reasons: job terminated, invalid job contact, network problems, ...
         * Before we assumed this happened when pilots used maximum number of open TCP connections however we are seeing the behavior on all gt5 sites regardless of how many pilots are in the queue
         * This morning it happened again but this time I had full debug on for our gridmanager logs and will send them to Jaime Frey of Condor Team.

Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.6 / 1.2.29
      *       32 (2) OSG 3.x (       6 are 3.1.6)
      *       67 (-1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       2 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents/Emergencies
      * NIST released a high level sudo vulnerability. Security team is investigating how this can affect OSG resources. WS-GRAM and Bestman both use sudo. 
   * Operations
      * SHA-2 transition: We need test certificates with SHA-2 hashes to test our software. CILogon will give us personal certs but not service certs. Has asked IGTF if any CA would produce the test certs. Alan Sill and Mike Helm said they each may be able to help with this. We need to create a list of service FQDNs and contact them. 
      * Phasing out the old-style CA bundles. We will need help from productions and software teams. We need to identify which sites uses the old-style CA bundles and why.
