---++ Production Support (Bo)
&lt;img src=&quot;http://reports.grid.iu.edu/reports/opp-week.png&quot;&gt;
   * Met with AMS (http://www.ams02.org) last week while at CERN. Would like to use a considerable amount of computing in the next week for GEANT4-based simulation. Plan on setting up a dedicated schedd at MIT to flock to local resources and the OSG 
      * Set up OSG Project &quot;AMS&quot; 
   * Watching opportunistic flow as CMS jobs in the US tanked overnight due to networking problems


---++ Software (Tim C.)
   * Gratia brokenness
      * When processing job IDs, if any local job precedes the first remote job from HTCondor-CE, all subsequent remote job IDs are quarantined
      * Fix #1: Change parsing of HTCondor’s !GridJobId attribute for batch system job ID ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-185][GRATIA-185]])
      * Fix #2: Make searches for &lt;code&gt;gratia_certinfo_*&lt;/code&gt; files more robust ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-186][GRATIA-186]])
   * March:
      * Ship a new version of Gratia (see above)
      * Ship an initial version of HTCondor-CE-Bosco
      * Ship the HDFS plugins (!GridFTP and !XRootD) for EL&amp;nbsp;7
      * Possibly update to later patchlevel of Hadoop 2.0.0
      * Update to an improved GRAM PBS jobmanager in which the SEG works
      * Update to HTCondor 8.4.4 and (in Upcoming) HTCondor 8.5.2
      * Small tweaks to HTCondor-CE
      * Keep working on EL&amp;nbsp;7
   * Lots of site support, especially with CEs (Clemson, Colorado, FIU, Harvard, MIT, Northwestern)
   * Internal stuff&amp;hellip;
