-- Main.DanFraser - 06 Nov 2012
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * CMS has requested that all T2 sites begin transitioning to SL6, so this activity will be increasing. (Tony)
   * There was a single BDII failure on Nov 9. Failover happened so no outages were visible from the outside. Cause was determined to be a firmware restart in the RAID controller. (Scott)
   * CMS noted there were a couple of errors, one of which involved trying to start a PerfSonar server on sites that did not have it installed. This may be a regression error. (Tony)

   * One instance (is2, Indianapolis) of BDII failed at ~7:50 (eastern) on 9/Nov. The Bloomington instance was unaffected and picked up the load. The problem became invisible to outside users at 9:00 and full service was restored at 12:00. All automated notification systems behaved as expected.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Updated 11/12/2012. Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG. 
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.11 / 1.2.31
      *       56 (0) OSG 3.x (      12 are 3.1.11)
      *       45 (-3) OSG 1.2.X resources (       0 are 1.2.31)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        0 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
SURAGrid reported today at the OSG Council call that they have not found glideinWMS to be a good match for their environment.  User Support (Chander) has been asked to work with Steve Johnson (SURAGrid) to understand the issue and attempt mitigation.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incident/Emergencies
      * Condor vulnerabilities.Multiple vulnerabilities affecting different Condor flavors. Running scripts on CEs to find the vulnerable versions. Most of them are high-level vulnerabilities. Will work with GOC to send reminders to sites
   * Operations
      * CIlogon Basic CA certs are accepted at GOC IT services for access (MyOSG, OIM, Docdb) and at MWT2, Purdue, Nebraska, and Sprace. Working on getting more resources to accept CIlogon CA.   
      * PKI Transition. We should reach out to VOs and sites to inform them about end-end tasks involved with transition. Created a Guidance document at  https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/PKITransitionGuidanceForVOs. Appreciate any feedback. 
      * An important issue is that users with new certs will be mapped into different pool accounts than the pool accounts they had in the past. new DN will mean new pool account mapping. The old DN and the old pool account will still exist until the old DN is removed from the VOMS.   
      * Got the SHA-2 signed ESNet CA and DOEGrids CA certs from ESNet team. Many thanks to them. This was a lot of work for them to switch their root CA&#39;s certs to SHA-2. This allows us to test everything end-end. We created a CA test bundle for ITB and will release it soon. 
      * Working on setting up a drill with Glideinwms submission system. Currently learning more about the security of the glideinwms system and deisgning what type of a drill we want to do. will report more on this later.
