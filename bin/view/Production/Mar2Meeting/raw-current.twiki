Remember about:
   * Xrootd informal meeting over lunch on Monday
   * Joint LHC Tier 3 session Tuesday afternoon
   * Talk with the experts on Thursday morning

The organizers sent out a form soliciting for questions and the talk with the experts session. The submitter of the best set of questions received by Sunday 2/20 will receive an !iPod nano. This 
should be promoted to sites and Tier 3s.

Rob pointed out a couple of glitches with OSGAH preparation:
   * The OSG AH presentation PDF was no mentioning satellite meetings
      * this could reduce attendees
      * somepeople may be looking for the information
