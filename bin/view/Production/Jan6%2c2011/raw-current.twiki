---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg, Steven, Derek, Brian, Horst, Philippe, Justin Ross, Dan F.

---+++ Notes:
   * HTPC usage has dwindled to a dozen or so jobs per day. Greg&#39;s main HTPC user from Wisconsin graduated and the Chem E department at Wisconsin just got a new cluster and is running most of their jobs on the local system. Bottom line: we need to get more folks on the user side of HTPC.
      * Greg is working with researchers at Virginia Tech that are possible HTPC candidates
      * Steve is running jobs with one researcher Laura I. He will circle back with her and identify what her future plans for HTPC may entail. 
      * Another possible HTPC user (Brenda Temple at UNC) has been identiified. Dan to encourage John to follow up on this user.
      * There is a user at Nebraska that periodically drops a thousand or so jobs on the Nebraska cluster. This may be a candidate. Brian/Derek to follow up. 
   * The sweet spot for HTPC users seems to be Molecular Dynamics. This app has the need for moderate parallelism and also high throughput. 
   * Philippe has identified a way to track HTPC jobs in LSF, but it requires searching the original submit command and looking for the exclusive flag. The plan is to get this fix together with the patch for PBS and Condor into the VDT soon, while continuing to discuss with the LSF folks whether there can be a better way to identify these jobs. Current estimate is that the fix should be completed next week and then it can move into the VDT process soon.
   * Dan B. is working on the current Condor release. After that he will work on adding the Glide-in WMS submit host to GLOW. (according to Greg)
   * Justin to provide Greg a user account so that he can try and figure out why HTPC jobs are not running at his site. 
   * Derek added the HTPC configuration for Prairiefire on the HTPC twiki. Steve used this information and was able to run jobs there. He has so far been successful at running HTPC jobs on PrairieFire and UCSD, in addition to the local PBS RENCI cluster, by making OSGMM use the correct RSL based on site targeting.
