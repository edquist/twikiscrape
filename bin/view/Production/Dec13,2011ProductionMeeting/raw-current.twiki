---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * BDII Issues at CERN had a significant impact on the BNL T1. Others including T2 and USCMS T1 did not see as much impact. 
   * BDII v5 at the GOC inserted and removed from RR after both crashed within 2 hours of being inserted. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/BDIIv5RCA][Initial Timeline and RCA]]
      * Xin requested a size limit confirmation for BDII transfers, Rob will find this out. 
   * There are now two sites at 1.0.x. Is it time to target these sites for update removal? Marco will send the names of these sites and Rob will make an initial contact to ask about there plans.

      * Pre-release repository added to repo.grid.iu.edu
      * Some broken links repaired.
      * Removed an alert that sent directly to goc@.
      * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-december.html][Release notes]] are available.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Began testing a new condor_gridmanager from Jaime Frey of the Condor team on the ITB factory to help handle some issues with held jobs we get on EGI CREAM sites.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/12/osg-software-version-305-has-been.html][RPM Middleware Release]]
      * New CA package 1.25
   * Two additional instances of BDII will be added to DNS RR.
      * Added at 9:00 EST, both had crashed by slightly after 11:00 EST. Removed from RR by 13:00. 
      * RCA In Progress - [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/BDIIv5RCA][Link]]. 
   * 8 hour window, statring on hour early. (8:00 eastern)
   * Gratia Maintenance
      * Wednesday, Thursday, Friday - Mostly Transparent. 
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Testing the condor_gridmanager took precedence over general testing of glideinWMS 2.5.3 and condor 7.6.4 last week so we will hold off on upgrading GOC factory this week but may still upgrade UCSD depending on how testing goes this week.
   * Scott, Soichi, and Rob visiting FNAL Thursday and Friday

---++ Engage (Mats)


---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)
   * Released OSG 3.0.5
      * Release includes quite a few components including the CE, RSV, and SE software
   * Finished digicerts and doe ca certs testing

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.25
      *       90 (-7) OSG 1.2.X resources (      24 are 1.2.25)
      *        1 (-1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        6 (2) Resources listing RPMs (OSG 3?)
Site coordination meeting this week, 12/15
   * Special topic: OSG Release 3
   * SiteCoordination.SitesCoord111215
   * Phone: # 866-740-1260, code 8349885#
   * Adobe connect: http://osg.acrobat.com/osgsc111215/ 


---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * No operational emergencies, vulnerabilities, incidents.
   * New CA package 1.25 released to production. Has the extended lifetime DOEgrids CA cert. The cert itself is the same (pub/pri keys) but lifetimes are extended. Existing DOEgrids ca is expiring on January 23 2013. But we recommend stop using the old cert after Janury 2012 because its lifetime will be less than a year. may cause issues with security libraries.
      * We will provide extra help for the end users during the switch as browsers may complain with switching the CA certs. We have a list of problems from the switch 4 years ago.  
   * DigiCert testing is almost complete. Only waiting for Steve Timm&#39;s answers. No major failures so far. 
   * SHA-2 transition of end user certificates. Just a heads up that we will start testing our software stack to identify sha-2 support. 
   * Added software developers to our regular security announcement lists. So when there is a vulnerability, they will also receive the announcements.
