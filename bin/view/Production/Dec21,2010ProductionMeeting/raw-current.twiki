-- Main.DanFraser - 30 Nov 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * A power outage at CERN over the past weekend caused production issues with both Atlas and CMS for about 4 hours until power was restored.
   * CMS plans to test the new BDII (IS4) before the next production change cycle on Jan 11. 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Marcia, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * LHC: CERN power cut over the weekend
   * 200 khour/day, 92% success
   * BlueArc latency issues at the Tier 1; working with vendor to resolve

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * US ATLAS production over the week was relatively stable at the level of ~10k running jobs. Majority of running jobs are Geant4 simulation tasks. Reconstruction step of some of that data, which is higher in priority for physics analysis, is also going on. Also some preparation for possible simulation at 8TeV energy if the decision is taken to increase the LHC energy. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 84%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 646K managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 92K jobs per day
         * failed 76K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  90%,  walltime - 95%
      * Failure rate is back to normal level. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 400~600TB/day, drop on Wednesday was due to the scheduled SE downtime. 
   * Issues

   * Testing VTB release for OSG 1.2.17
      * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p24.html][Changes]]
      * Currently working on an rsv bug which is preventing an ITB release

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.16
      *       94 (1) OSG 1.2.X resources (       5 are 1.2.16)
      *        4 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
