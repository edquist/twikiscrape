   * Worker node requirements (while the application is running)
      * 500MB RAM per cpu core
      * 100MB per cpu core in OSG_WN_TMP to store runtime data
   * Job Duration
      * runtime is adjustable ( default 12h, up to 48 hours on large resource )
      * job will react to TERM issued by Condor 
   * Disk space requirements:
      * optimum: 100MB in OSG_DATA for each core utilized on the resource
      * 2GB in OSG_APP to deploy all software
   * Network Requirements:
      * Outgoing network connection to einstein.phys.uwm.edu:80 and buran.aei.mpg.de:24999
   * Additional Information:
      * To reduce load on NFS servers, the newest version uses OSG_WN_TMP for runtime data and stores the application directory in OSG_DATA only when finished.
      * Works well on CMS Tier 1 and others up to several thousand jobs running simultaneously
      * All job submissions go through Condor-G utilizing GT2.
