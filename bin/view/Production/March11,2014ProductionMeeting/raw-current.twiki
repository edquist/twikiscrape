   * &quot;After careful analysis, !ESnet and its DOE program management have concluded that audio, video, and web services are no longer within the appropriate mission scope of !ESnet. As a result, we plan to discontinue our collaboration service offering (known as ECS) on September 30, 2014. As a result of this change, the !ReadyTalk audio/web and ECS video collaboration services offered by !ESnet will stop accepting new registrations on July 1, 2014.&quot;
