---++ Announcements:   

---++ Action/Significant Items: 
   * many usual attendees at CHEP.
   * a new version of CVMFS (requested by !NOvA) is forthcoming. We will need an announcement effort to get it adopted.
   * fetch-crl verification was failing on the 1.78 IGTF release. The problem was associated with an Argentine CA and has been resolved.
   * the next IGTF release will trigger an automated update on the GOC repo-itb service. This can be easily implemented on the production instances should this turn out to be a good idea.
