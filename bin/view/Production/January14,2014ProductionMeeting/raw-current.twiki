---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Incidents/Vulnerabilities
      * Another bitcoin mining incident in WLCG. A CMS user found running such algorithms. We had an atlas user doing the same a few weeks ago. The cms user admitted that he was running the jobs and his credentials were not compromised, he claimed he killed all of his jobs. Apparently, he did not think about the consequences of running such jobs. The user is suspended from CMS and we did not find any jobs running on OSG. We should send out an announcement or newsletter article to the community to remind them that OSG/WLCG resources are only for scientific purposes and any other activities should not be conducted on them. 
      * A vulnerability with NTP servers allowing them to part of a botnet to launch DDoS attacks over 3rd parties. Sent an announcement to OSG sites. Perfsonar is vulnerable to such attacks. We will send another announcement when the patch for perfsonar is ready

   * Operations
      * IGTF is stopping distributing the old-format CA package layout. We have done tests and in preparation for this since 2012. Because some of our sites and VOs needed extra time, we asked IGTF to postpone for a while but our extension reached its end. The next IGTF distribution will be only new-format CA package layout (including symlinks for sha-1 and sha-2 hashes in filenames). Please let me know ASAP if you know a reason why we cannot switch to new layout completely.
