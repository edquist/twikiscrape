   * frontend client was set up by Robert
   * found two frontend.xml files
      * contacted Robert to identify which file to modify
      * contacted sys admin to obtain w permission on frontend.xml files

---+++ OSG-ITB Testing
   * Pre-staged data to UC_ITB
   * Can&#39;t authenticate with  FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB, contacted Steve Timm, FERMI is also updating OSG version
   *  BNL_ITB_Test1 down
    
   
---++ Grid Operations Center (Scott)
---+++ Announcements
   * A water leak in the IUPUI machine room required one instance of BDII to be shut down. It was removed from DNS RR at 17:00 (eastern) Friday, 2/Dec. Service continued through the weekend with a single instance hosted at IUB. The IUPUI instance was restored to service in the morning of Monday 5/Dec. All power sockets that were submerged will be replaced at a time yet to be announced. We have been assured we will be notified prior to this replacement. Our [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/12/osg-bdii-at-is2gridiuedu-offline-this.html][announcement]] about this issue.
   * The IU mandated privacy policy will go into effect 13/Dec. Read it [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/IUPrivacyPolicy][here]]
   * Two additional instances of BDII will be added to DNS round robin on 13/Dec. These will be running BDII v5.
   * The 13/Dec change window starts at 8:00 (eastern) and lasts 8 hours.
---+++ Operations Last Week

   * No release last week, 5th Tuesday.
---+++ Operations This Week
   * Pre-release repository added to repo.grid.iu.edu
   * Some broken links repaired.
   * Removed an alert that sent directly to goc@.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.25
      *       97 (3) OSG 1.2.X resources (      24 are 1.2.25)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        4 (0) Resources listing RPMs (OSG 3?)
Site coordination meeting next week, 12/15
   * Special topic: OSG Release 3 - New general release (Including CE)
   * SiteCoordination.SitesCoord111215

---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Incident report from FNAL-FermiGrid. Thought as DOS attack, but turned out to be student job consuming memory. Two underlying problems caused the issue. A VO should not keep sending jobs on behalf of a user who fails authN at a site. Pilot jbs somehow increase their memory footprint even after a user fails glexec. 
      * IRC botnet announcement. Several IRC bots were placed on US universities that are also members of OSG. Grids-sec contacted the universities. No compromises on osg grid sites. No further feedback form sites.
   * DigiCert testing in ITB. Expected to finish by next week. No component failure so far (CS/GUMS /VOMS tested).  
   * DOEgrids root CA expiring. New root CA has been released to IGTF. OSG delayed adopting the new release without testing the cert in ITB. Doing a test in ITB with a few sites which are not doing DigiCert. Two sites completed tests. Waiting for Suchandra to do tests. Expected production release is Dec 14th. ESnet today reported they plan to start using the new root cert in production on Dec 14th. This may cause problem with our release date. We are responding asap. 
      * Examining problems from end user perspective. We found notes from last time DOEGrids updated root certs. It caused problems in browsers. We are examining whether the same problems still exists and how we can mitigate them before reaching the end user.
