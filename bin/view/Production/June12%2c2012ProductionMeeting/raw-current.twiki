-- Main.ScottTeige - 12 Jun 2012


---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * With PACMAN installation of the OSG software, initiators would automatically download new CA packages from the repository as they came online.  With the OSG RPM install this no longer happens. Hence unless there is a manual update, the sites go into warning mode. We need a mechanism to support automatic CA updates in the RPM package. Dan to make a request to the SW team and Security team to fix this ASAP. 
   * Currently there is an explicit filter for SE-only sites in the OSG BDII that prevents SE-only sites from appearing in the BDII. Marco to file a ticket with the GOC.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.3 / 1.2.28
      *       30 (2) OSG 3.x (      10 are 3.1.3)
      *       71 (2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      15 are 1.2.28)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)

   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * None. 
   * Operations
      * Incident Drills with 3 more Trash/Tier3 sites were completed last week. Went well. 
      * We see sites with warning statuses regarding their CA package version. This is due to a slight out-of-synch between tarball and rpm releases. We contacted VDT team and they will make sure the CA rpm bundle available in an hour. 
      * Nebraska also reported another rsv probe warning due to the lack of German CA CRL outage. This outage will not affect sites RSV probe and availability scores. We are investigating if the problem is with the CA.
