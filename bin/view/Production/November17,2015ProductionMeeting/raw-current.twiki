---++ Security (Jeny, Mine) 
   * Vulnerabilities
      * NSS and NSPR vulnerability: announcement sent. Sites should update ASAP.
 
   * OSG CA 
      * Atlas has started transitioning their users to CERN CA for personal certs. A warning message is amended to OIM-originated expiry notices that Atlas users should go to CERN CA to renew their certs. CERN has deployed new OSG CA and Atlas is very close to start its transition. 
      * CMS is stil in testing mode. They should complete by the end November. We plan to star the transition Dec 1st. 
      * Couple issues. The OIM-CIlogon HSM connection was broken last week due to a expired OIM cert. This is fixed and now we are back to issuing certs. 
      * Globus is making a big change to gss api. New libraries coming in Feb 2016 will only implement a strict RFC-2818 interpretation of subject alternative names field in the certificates. Cilogon HSM and OSG OIM code needs to be changed to accommodate multiple FQDNs in the SAN field. The security team tested SAN field with our current system. Security team made a request to CILogon HSM to start this work. We also organized a project meeting tomorrow to discuss our status, next steps and the changes related to SAN field. 
      * Fermilab transitions in January. We are pushing them to finish their tests. 
      * We almost finished scheduling all the VOs for the transition. 
      * An OSG newsletter is coming out soon. 
 
   * Request to Digicert for remove the wrong SHA-2 intermediate CA certificate from the IGTF bundle was accepted. 
      * New IGTF bundle 1.70 coming out next week will remove this certificate. 

   * DCAFI Project. Distributed Computing Access with Federated Identities. This project&#39;s goal is to move IF experiments to CIlogon Basic CA and federated identities. We are undergoing an architectural review this week. Afterwards we will push the coding work. 
   * HEPCloud.  
      * Security review is continuing. Reviewing Amazon&#39;s credential management process and understanding how that entails with CMS and OSG submission systems. 
   * Review of HTCondor-CE Web App. This webapp mines the information from the CE as an unprivileged user and published it. Anand is reviewing this app in terms of security.
