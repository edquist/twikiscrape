-- Main.DanFraser - 05 Aug 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * There was a network outage last Tuesday that took out the entire IU domain (including both BDIIs) for more than two hours. OSG was lucky that this did not have a significant impact on OSG usage. Rob has determined from researching with the networking folks at IU that it was a configuration error. The Production Coordinator has made a formal request to the Operations Coordinator that he in turn should make a formal request to the IU networking folks to adopt a strict change management process including fixed pre-defined change windows for their network operations. (Dan, Rob)
   * There was an unplanned power outage on the CMS tier 1 that ran through Tuesday evening. The system looked to users like it was available but the worker nodes were all down. There will be a planned power outage to address this problem this Thursday from 8 to 12 pm.

---++ Attendees:
   * Britta, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Machine: issues with site-wide power outage and cryo compressors.  Machine development ongoing -- should be back for physics on Sep 3.   
   * 527 khour/day, 96% success.
   * IU network outage: we did not suffer much because of it (got lucky?)
   * CMS T1 had a power outage affecting only the worker nodes on Tuesday night.  There will be a downtime on Thursday from 0800-1200 CDT which will
      only affect the worker nodes.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC was not productive every day last week, but still delivered about 250pb-1 luminosity to ATLAS. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now is 2.55fb-1. 
      * US ATLAS production during the week continue to be not very stable, with mixture of simulation and reprocessing activities. Nevertheless the reprocessing progress is quite good, without problems. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 3.0M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 78%. 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 860K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300TB~400TB last week at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites
         * GLOW VO: work in progress on MWT2/UTA/WT2, other T1/T2 sites already support it.

---++ OSG Operations (Rob Q.)
---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3k3lqjh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/08/network-outage-at-indiana-university.html][Network outage]] 16:15-18:35 16/Aug. All services were unavailable during this period. All services continued to run during the outage, no action by GOC to recover was required.
      * Tracked to Human error in Institutional DNS. 
      * Weekly Availability should be reduced by 1.39% due to the network outage experienced 16/Aug
      * Monthly Availability will be reduced by 0.32% due to the network outage experienced 16/Aug
   * ITB release
      * Moved several ITB services to new hardware, frees up a host.
   * New OSG CA Package Removing Syrian CA which is not responding
   * RPM repository, [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RPMRepositoryPlan][some ideas]] are being discussed.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Lost power to GCC-B facility from 8/16/2011 20:45 to 8/17/2011 13:30.  OSG Gratia reporting services failed over as scheduled but the daily reports (which run from cron) did not get E-mailed out that day.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Installed itb factory instance at glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu

---+++ Operations This Week

Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.21
      *       95 (-3) OSG 1.2.X resources (       7 are 1.2.21)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        0 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Incidents: Continuing bitcoin compromises. Various EDU sites are compromised. The same attacker seem to be involved in recent attacks and the past compromise at a Canadian site. Sent an announcement for the malicious address. Contacted three sites randomly to check if we give them sufficient info. We will send one more announcement with more info today or tomorrow. 
   * CIlogon CA is released to osg sites under an experimental ca cache. UCSD and Nebraska are the first two sites who downloaded the CIlogon. 
   * Migration to the new certificate layout. Steve Timm switched a CE a week ago. He did not have any problems and ready to switch more CEs. Xin switched a CE at BNL. No problems so far. Xin will be back on Th. We are searching for experienced SE admins to migrate them. 
   * Non-critical Operational problem with uscms-fnal-wc1-ce3 , ce2, and c1. GOC is not receiving any records for MetricName=&quot;org.osg.certificates.crl-expiry&quot; from any of those resources. Local site admin is confirmed that the probes run properly. Perhaps there is a configuration or transportation problem. Ticket opened for the issue.
