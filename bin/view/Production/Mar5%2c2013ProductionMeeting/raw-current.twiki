   * ATLAS and CMS both busy, but very stable. 
   * OASIS 2-3 beta testing going well. Production release 2-3 weeks after the AHM. 
   * Should we start a campaign to nudge the 37 resources still using Pacman? If we are going to meet the goal of a May retirement of Pacman this needs to be started soon.

      * Gratia report: 1.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 82%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.6 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week

Monitoring detected it automatically and it was quickly restarted each time.  Still investigating the cause with the developers.  No obvious loads out of the ordinary.
      * Discussions still under way between us, Soichi, and probe developers (UNL) on maintenance of various database tables needed to send the output of the gratia-bdii probe to production Gratia.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.15 / 1.2.32
      *       66 (-1) OSG 3.x (       2 are 3.1.15)
      *       37 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       0 are 1.2.32)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * New Java zero day vulnerability. Oracle made an emergency release for java 7. Vulnerability became public couple days ago and patch came today. Patch for java 6 is not available and may be forthcoming. It mainly affects browsers. So no important affect on OSG, but we will make a blog post about this to inform our end users. It is recommended to either patch java 7 asap or disable java 7 in user browsers. 
      * Lots of SL security updates. keeping a close eye on those. Nothing major to alert our users yet. 
   * Operations: 
      * DOEGrids PKI transition is getting close. March 23rd is the turn off date. Questions/Complaints? security team will attend the Tier2/3 workshops for atlas and cms at osg ahm. Please let us know if you want security team to contact you at the AHM. 
      * Traceability requirements. Security team will conduct a security exercise with OSG-XSEDE frontend to understand the existing traceability capabilities. The sceurity team also installed a test instance of its own frontend and hooked it up with ITB Factory. That allowed us to see first hand how we can trace jobs without user certificates. 
      * OASIS/CVMFS security assessment. Thanks to GOC (Scott/Rob) for replying to our questions. We will go a few more rounds of questions until we converge on our understanding.
