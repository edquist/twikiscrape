      * Gratia report: 2M pilots, 6M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 89% (for single core jobs)

   * Nearly 1.3B total hours across all sites last year; 127M in December
   * More jobs at Stanford
   * Clemson seems to be working again
   * Progress at JINR on HTCondor-CE; potential issue now with OIM registration
   * Bern having an issue with OIM registration breaking Rebus (EGI accounting); want to de-register
      * Could also make a problem for Lancaster and/or Manchester if they were to ever register with OIM
   * Stampede update: mostly working but some system tools (lgc-cp, globus-ulr-copy, etc.) not installed on systems. The workaround is to get them out of OASIS; CMS and MINOS still need to implement that.
