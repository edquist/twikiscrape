We still have sites where pilots are failing at high rates and those will be pursued; a specific case is Purdue – we have asked for help from Kim Dillman.

We are enabling the US collaborators of the XENON project to run MC in opportunistic mode via vo=osg.  The XENON Dark Matter Experiment located at the Gran Sasso Laboratories (INFN, Italy) is searching for the so called Dark Matter, something which is completely different from ordinary matter.
