---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * Very similar to the last time, there were not enough jobs to keep the sites full, so USATLAS total production over this week was also unstable, fluctuating at the 7-30K running job level.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.1 M pilots processed, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 71%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.44M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week 
      * Data transfer rate was around ~650TB/day at BNL T1.

---+++ Operations Last Week

   * Grid Operations Center
      * !OpenSSL Issue - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2013/12/openssl-101e-linked-to-gsi-failures.html][Link]]
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * 400 GB SSD has been ordered.
      * Tested and made HTCondor 8.0.4 the default for glideins.
      * Performed more cleanup on GOC Factory disk, got it under 80%
      * Began working with CMS to get an entry into the production factories for the CERN HLT cloud resource.
   * OSG-Connect
      * Stash storage outage
         * Friday morning to Sunday afternoon
         * Instability caused by Ceph upgrade (0.67 -&gt; 0.72), combined with rebalancing due to configuration change, and unknown bug that caused rebalancing to grind to a halt until servers were rebooted (would have been fixed much earlier if not for this bug). Upon restarting Ceph metadata service (MDS), the MDS stop file accesses until pools return to &quot;HEALTH_OK&quot;, which resulted in a hung mount until the rebalance was complete.
         * Stash mount hung / unmounted until problem was resolved. Users had to submit jobs to write to homedir instead of stash.
         * Only one active user impacted.

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

OSG-XD continues to operate uneventfully; 2.4M hours in last 2 weeks under vo=osg.
 
!BakerLab flocking has been moved from the UCSD submit host (vo=engage) to the OSG-XD submit host.

We are re-designing the group structure in the OSG-XD submit host to better manage priorities and provide better access to resources for flocking connections.

Opportunistic access to BNL from vo=osg has been restored; a GUMS issue was resolved.


---++ Security (Kevin)
   * No new major incidents or vulnerabilities
   * Kernel update in SL/RHEL for information leak in Xen
   * New CA bundle ready for release with new IGTF version 1.55. No other changes.
