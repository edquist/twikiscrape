---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2010March1][Previous Meeting Agenda]]
   * Availability metrics for the last week 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ycdecwn][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]]
         * Small blip in BDII RSV Monitoring, the GOC will investigate. This outage was seen on the OSG BDII (2170) but not the WLCG BDII (2180), this looks to be a bug in the monitoring. 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/y96wtjb][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/03/vdt-web-site-downtime.html][VDT Web Site Downtime]] - resolve
   * *GOC Debian Repo*

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.8
      *       70 OSG 1.2.X resources (      12 are 1.2.8)
      *        9 OSG 1.0.X resources (       2 are 1.0.5)
      *       11 OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        2 OSG 0.8.0 resources


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)
  
   * D0 
      * MC Production ramped up further. Average 9.8 M Events/week; 115,000 wall-hours/day at 80% efficiency. 
      * D0-internal problems: disk space filled up in in submission infrastructure.

   * GLUE-X
      * Site-side: Abhishek facilitating other VOs to use GLUE-X site in production. GLUE-X site now in use by Engage, GEANT4, GPN, LIGO, SBGrid, GLOW.
      * VO-side: Next step for GLUE-X workflow management - need to decide on a scheme for job dispatch. Abhishek &amp; Dan discussing options with Richard Jones.
      * Policy related feedback: Lack of OSG policy on POSIX account requirements; a site&#39;s support for multiple VOs; multiple sites&#39; support for a specific VO.

   * SBGrid
      * VO-side: BNL team is setting up Panda submission infrastructure for SBGrid operations.
      * Site-side: SBGrid local site upgraded to OSG v1.2; no known issues.

   * HCC
      * David Swanson conveyed that team is currently deploying VOMS server.

   * !CompBioGrid 
      * Site-side: Local site running at full capacity; continuing to provide cycles for Engage and SBGrid.
      
   * Working with VOs to collect direct input for:
      * Production resource planning (with Dan). Input received from LIGO, D0, GLUE-X, DOSAR, JDEM.
      * Software Enhancement Proposals (with Alain). Input received from GLUE-X.

   * Starting next cycle of updates to:
      * Scientific publications resulting from substantial use of OSG.
      * Stakeholder plans/needs and requirements database, with emphasis on: (i) current production averages, (ii) future production estimates.
