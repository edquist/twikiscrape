-- Main.DanFraser - 24 Jun 2009
---++ Action Items:
   * Next meeting Wed July 8 at 10:00 FNAL 9th floor NE conference center.
      * Next week is the Storage Meeting at FNAL
   * Rob continuing to work on setting up a CMS CE.
      * Tanya to assist Rob with bug in !BeStMan installation/workaround.
      * Rob S. is running STEP &#39;09 tests on CMS T3s -- will continue working to characterize results
   * Doug to continue working with BNL on setting up an Atlas VM testbed for T3s
      * Current plan is to package separate VMs including:
         * Condor Master + schedd
         * XROOT redirector and PROOF
         * SRM + possibly !GridFTP
   * Ongoing work to see if Atlas T2 stress tests be extracted as a T3 test set (Doug)
   * Dan working with Mine on Security how-to&#39;s for T3s

---++ Attendees: 
   * Rob S., Doug, Tanya, Marco, Dan, Steve Timm (guest speaker)

---++ Notes:
   * Steve Timm addressed the group
      * Provided background on VM efforts at FNAL. Currently there are four separate VMs for the gatekeeper, VOMS, GUMS, SAZ.
      * Recommended use of RPATH for helping to create VMs. RPATH is also used by CERN-VM project.
      * Kate at ANL has figured out a way to use host certs in running on the cloud. Would be good to understand how she does this. Doug was planning to follow up with Kate who is at the workshop at CERN.
   * VM difficulties include:
      * Once a hostname has been configured, it is difficult to change it in VDT (e.g. cannot simply update a config file)
      * Installations that require root logins can be difficult. Currently all G-Lite software requires root, some storage software: GridFTP, and VDT Cron jobs.
      * Problems with XEN Dom0 stability, although Steve is running an older version and has not had recent problems.
      * Older versions of OS&#39;s if used can limit performance (EIDE hard drives, 100MB Ethernet)
   * Rob S working to set up an in-house CMS T3 CE.
      * Once complete will integrate with Tanya&#39;s SE
      * It was re-iterated this week that setting one of these up is still non-trivial even for an &quot;expert&quot;
         * Installing Phedex required an upgrade of BeStMan, and this is currently broken.
         * Tanya helping to determine if we should wait for a fix or start performing a workaround.
   * Doug is working with Michael at BNL to get a VM testbed setup. He has already identified a couple of people who will be helping with VM creation. Current plan is to create separate VMs for key software packages.
