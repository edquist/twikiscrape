---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/6nh3glo][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * ITB release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/08/goc-service-update-tuesday-august-14th.html][Release note]]
      * !MyOSG: expose additional information and cosmetic improvements
      * OIM: changes associated with new PKI infrastructure
      * Additions to installed capacity report 
   * Bug in !GridFtp RSV probe. Emergency change at the collector and re-send of the data corrected the problem.
 
   * !FermiGrid Ops: Gratia probe/collector problems under investigation between Steve and Soichi.

---+++ Operations This Week

   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/08/goc-service-update-tuesday-august-14th.html][Release note]]
      * Possible version specific !MyOSG problem, standing by on rollback.
      * Deferred Installed Capacity Report modification, software release did not happen in time

   * WMS Glide In Factory: Upgrade GOC Factory during production maintenance window to glideinWMS 2.6

---++++ Reworking morning RSV reports
   * [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/testatlas.html][ATLAS]] report
   * [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/testcms.html][CMS]] report


---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * Bosco v1 is fundamentally code complete. We are doing a final round of testing with the development team to understand networking (e.g. firewall) limitations and then want to expand our round of testing to ITB and some Atlas T3 sites before releasing to &#39;production&#39;.
   * On the HTPC front, we finally got many more partitionable slots deployed at Wisconsin and are having good luck with them. Mainly testing memory use, though, rather than CPUs. Greg is waiting on feedback from Brian B. and Dan F. on his draft document.
   * Our new Campus Researcher Club engagement request form is in production now. We are working on an OSG home page link to the service.

---++ Software (Alain)

OSG Software 3.1.8 will be released today. Of particular note:

   * Security release for Condor. We recommend you upgrade
   * Bug fixes for:
      * osg-cleanup
      * Gratia probes
      * RSV
   * Other miscellaneous changes

---++ Integration (Suchandra) 
   * Trash/Trash/Integration glideinWMS work:
      * Spoke and did some work with Maxim to add CERN frontend to integration factory
      * Added entry for Mats to use, will continue later this week
 

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.7 / 1.2.29
      *       34 (-1) OSG 3.x (       7 are 3.1.7)
      *       65 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       8 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        1 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Important Condor update. Cannot publicize yet. Will send out announcement when Condor team is ready
      * Voms-admin patching. We postponed this a long while ago. We need to find a way to upgrade the voms-admin for the vulnerabiity and the compatibility with new certificte bundles 
   * Operational issues:
      * SHA-2 transition. Contacted Atlas and CMS about the VO software testing needs. Will shortly send eails to VO and sites informing them about tetsing needs. Already contacted GOC services. Scott is putting a plan in place.
      * CA update process for rpm bundles. Still do not have a solution and waiting for VDT team.
      * Sent ET update about using EGI-ran Pakiti server. Have not heard any obejctions. Will start the transition next week. 
      * RSV CA probe failure threshold is increased to 8 days. Marco Mambelli will push the code out.
   * Lots of sites are running 1.X versions of OSG. Making a list of security vulnerabilities included in older versions. We need to establish a firm position once we get the complete picture.
