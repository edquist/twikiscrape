| # | Owner | Action/Significant Item | Open Date | Close Date |
|28| All | Recalculation of BNL site availability and reliability, with GOC and WLCG is now complete. | 3/29/2011 | |
|27| Rob | There was a transient MyOSG failure early Sunday morning, under investigation Prime suspect: 3:30AM Failed, 3:31AM OK; The alarm system worked correctly. | 3/15/2011 | |
|26| Rob, Xin | The problem with the OSG RSV probes in 1.2.17 noted several weeks ago created more widespread accounting issues in the WLCG reports for BNL than was previously recognized. The GOC team now has the remainder of these corrected and submitted to CERN. Rob will continue to track until Xin can verify their completeness. | 3/15/2011 | |
|25| Suchandra, Dan | The HTPC team needs to provide a mechanism for testing sites to see if they have correctly configured HTPC. Several ITB sites will be configured to support HTPC soon. | 3/15/2011 | |
|24| Rob | A third BDII (identical to IS1 and IS2) has been running stably alongside the GOC BDIIs for the past several weeks and will be introduced into the Round Robin next week during the change cycle. | 3/15/2011 | |
|23| Burt, Dan | Burt identified several settings and changes that need to be made to the VDT to make running the T3s easier. These have been passed to Alain and will be brought up as Production/T3 items to the VDT. | 3/15/2011 | |
|22| All | No production call next week due to the All Hands Meeting | 3/1/2011 | |
|21| All | Dan spoke with John-Paul Robinson of SuraGrid?. They are planning to become an OSG VO soon, perhaps to announce at the AHM. Dan suggested that interested parties join the VO calls as an entry point to OSG. | 3/1/2011 | |
|20| Brian | This brings into focus a larger problem on the OSG that we currently do not have any &quot;non hand built&quot; YUM repositories that we can depend on for OSG software distribution. | 3/1/2011 | |
|19| Scott | An operations problem was discovered whereby kernel updates were being pulled from a Nebraska Yum repository. The main fix is to specify which YUM repositories will be used explicitly during the upgrade process. | 3/1/2011 | |
|18| All | Brian noted that several sites reported Gratia probes being hung as a result of the ongoing networking issues at FNAL. Scott to follow up with Steve T. to identify and contact the affected sites. | 3/1/2011 | |
|17| Xin | The RSV accounting problem reported last week at BNL is still open. (Xin) Scott reported that the problems have been identified and the changes were resubmitted to the LCG. However the GridView monitor is not yet displaying the correct results. Scott to follow up with the WLCG. | 3/1/2011 | |
|16| All | We agreed upon HTPC attributes to be added to the config.ini file (htpc; htpc_rsl; htpc_vos; htpc_exclude_queue). Burt will start implementing these in the GIP to allow discovery of HTPC enabled sites. | 2/22/2011 | |
|15| Xin | The number of slots available for OSG opportunistic use at the Atlas Tier-1 has been changed from 40 to 60. | 2/22/2011 | |
|14| Suchandra | A race condition in the RSV WLCG accounting probe was discovered in 1.2.18 that could result in an &quot;unknown&quot; status was discovered. This is being fixed in 1.2.19. It is recommended that WLCG sites wait until this version to upgrade. | 2/22/2011 | |
|13| Rob, Xin | Accounting updates due to errors in the RSV probe 1.2.17 have been submitted and accepted into the WLCG. Rob is still working to ensure that these changes are visible in Gridview. | 2/22/2011 | |
|12| All | Upgrading to the latest kernel patches requires a reboot. GOC services will upgrade during the Production maintenance time next Tuesday. An 8-hour maintenance window has been approved to make sure there is time to get all the machines upgraded. | 2/15/2011 | |
|11| All | Sites that upgraded quickly to the latest 1.2.17 were incorrectly reporting status (as &quot;unknown) to the WLCG. An announcement was sent out encouraging sites to wait until ..18 where a fix is in progress. | 2/15/2011 | |
|10| All | Since HTPC is an upcoming requirement for both CMS and Atlas, Dan has requested that ITB sites begin enabling HTPC and add relevant HTPC tests to be ready for this transition. | 2/8/2011 | |
|9| All |  CMS Tier-1 is now HTPC enabled (Burt); Dan to provide information on config.any to Burt in order to start adding the HTPC attributes to GIP. | 2/8/2011 | |
|8| Britta | Neither Burt or Britta received the OSG Metrics report this week. | 2/8/2011 | |
|7| Rob, Scott | In January (Ticket 9809&lt;https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9809&gt;) there was an incorrect downtime recorded by the WLCG. RSV showed correctly that BNL had scheduled downtime; WLCG reported this as unscheduled downtime. Scott to reopen and try to understand what happened. | 2/8/2011 | |
|6| Britta, Robert |  LIGO hit a maximum usage day on Saturday: between 9k and 12k simultaneous jobs; 259 khours | 2/8/2011 | |
|5| All | Due to delays in the BDII v5, the Operations team is working on adding a third BDII v4 to the round robin. This way even if one of the BDII systems is down, the remaining BDIIs can support the full load. | 2/8/2011 | |
|4| All | The Atlas Tier-1 has turned off reporting data transfers due to the internal database filling up. | 2/1/2011 | |
|3| All | The Operations team has not yet found a way to successfully restart the BDII v5. Instead it needs to be rebuilt whenever a restart is needed. Ops will work with CERN to see if there is a workaround to this problem. However, until this is resolved BDII v5 is not targeted to be put into production. | 1/4/2011 | |
|2| All | The current filter on the Production BDII excludes SE-only sites. It was agreed to go ahead and update the filter at the next Change cycle on Tuesday. | 1/4/2011 | |
|1| All | Production continued steadily over the break; no major issues reported. | 1/4/2011 | |
