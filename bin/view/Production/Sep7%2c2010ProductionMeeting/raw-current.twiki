-- Main.DanFraser - 10 Aug 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Issue related to fixing the process as related to understanding CERN BDII failures is still in progress. Ruth is planning to bring it up at the next WLCG management meeting. 
   * Both Engage and LIGO are hitting limits as far as production goes due to the temporary increased CMS usage. LIGO is down to a fraction of what was previously available. Engage feels the limits both in the additional length of time it takes to get jobs started as well as the length of time it takes to get jobs back as noted in the Engage throughput charts. (Robert, Mats)
   * Scott is working on a written process for how new Gums templates get deployed (as part of an updated VO package). 
   * LSST is working well, averaging &gt;60K hours per day vs a target of 50K. (Brian)

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Scott T., Mine, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * LHC: currently commissioning.  No new data.
   * Processing: 330 khour/day, 95% success.  Mostly Monte Carlo and pre-production.  Further production/analysis waiting on new software release.
   * US playing a large role in CMS MC generation -- Tier 1 and Omaha are more than 30% of all simulation jobs.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC is not yet back from the technical stop. Work on beam commissioning is going on. So no new data for experiments. ATLAS was quite stable during the last week. About 9-10k running jobs all the time, mainly simulation jobs.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 84%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.1M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 156K jobs per day
         * failed 75K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 94%, walltime - 96%. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~400TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * SE-only info publishing to WLCG BDII for all USATLAS T3 sites
      * Open more job slots to OSG users

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.13

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Confusion over when cert request page will go live. Please confirm it is 9/14? Scott confirms it is. this was a miscommunication. 
   * Ticketing problems. Last week Scott received a series of strange tickets opened. he immediately let me know. the tickets turned out to be non-issue. I thank Scott for his diligence and attention to security.
   * GUMS template problems. for D0 to continue data transfer we should push out a new GUMS template. We decide to test the new template in ITB and then push this out. 
   * IGTF layout testing has been completed. Sorry this has been complete for a while now. But i think I did not report it earlier.
