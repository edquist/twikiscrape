---+++ Attendees : 
   * Rob S., Mine, Marco, Dan
---+++ Significant/Action Items:
   * Pakiti server code with fine-grained access control is implemented by EGEE and tested by OSG. Test results are successful.
      * The updates were quickly added by the Pakiti developers specifically to meet the needs of CMS (Anand, please thank the developers for us.)
   * Pakiti also has package view implemented. It shows whether a package is missing on a host node. The host node is where pakiti monitoring jobs will run.
   * OSG is waiting for the official release code from EGEE to start deploying the operational server.
      * Once we get the code, we will configure it against the CMS site list Rob provided earlier. We will look at which OSes are used by the sites and configure the vulnerability databases in the server setup accordingly
   * We will not ask the sites to install any client code initially.  We will run jobs remotely from the pakiti server. If a site disables our access to run jobs, then the site will not be reported in pakiti
   * For simplicity, we will not initially tell sites about how to deploy their own pakiti servers. We will later announce how to do this. This is useful for monitoring large number of worker nodes in a site.
   * With OSG-wide pakiti server, we cannot monitor the worker nodes properly since we do not know the addresses of each of the worker nodes. Even if we randomly queue monitoring jobs, we may not run jobs over all of the worker nodes. 
      *  Initially, we will only send jobs to gatekeepers.
   * If a site decides to deploy pakiti client, we can monitor worker nodes as well as storage nodes and other types of grid nodes, such as VOMS, GUMS servers, etc. This may be considered later.
   * Security team will deploy the server at NCSA and run this against CMS sites for the first couple months or until necessary. This will be an operational server (not a test machine). We will later ask the GOC, if agreed, to build and run the server at the GOC. We will not deploy the server on GOC machines immediately.
