   *  Computing: 260 khour/day, 93% success. CPU/wallclock at 66% (excluding FNAL skims: 75%). Skim/re-reconstruction continues at the Tier 1.
   * Storage: Tier 1 transferred 3.3 PB last week (peak of 600 TB/day). Tier 2s transfered 132 TB (peak: 25 TB/day). Probes still not functional yet at MIT, UERJ, SPRACE.

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * The reprocessing of summer 2008 data is postponed again, most likely to start at ~ August 31th, waiting for software release to be ready.  Most of non-US clouds were draining last week because of shortage of jobs. US sites are loaded with regional production tasks.

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 574K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 93%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 148K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  21K jobs per day
         * failed   21K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 87% for jobs and 97% for walltime

   * Site issue
      * There are still some problem with BNL dCache transfer gratia probe, under investigation by gratia team.
      * BNL retried the sitename consolidation today, so far so good. Will probably change again to the final name next week.

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
Major ITB/VTB tasks last week:
   * Work on testing vdt update to correct rsv gratia problem
   * Documentation changes to improve support of osg 1.0 / osg 1.2 and documenting differences between the two


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2
      * 15 OSG 1.2
      * 33 OSG 1.0.X resources (20 are 1.0.4)

I have a conflict and will not be able to attend today. Only production issue is low success rates, which we are looking into.


---++ Metrics (Brian)
   * Setbacks at BNL SE - turns out that the &quot;improved probe&quot; is hitting a bug that doesn&#39;t affect FNAL for some unknown reason.  Maybe Brian will see Xin at the USATLAS meeting?
   * There has been much confusion in ATLAS and with Gratia folks with regards to naming schemes.  We are working on a &quot;best practices&quot; recommendation for all the stakeholders, and will be presenting this plan soon.  Until we have a consistent message, it&#39;s not possible to &quot;fix&quot; most issues - because there&#39;s no agreement what the correct solutions should be.
      * I.e., some Gratia SiteNames correspond to OIM Resource Group name, others correspond to OIM Resource Name.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

---+++ Functional VOs

   * D0 -- MC Production average at 55,000 hours/day. Equivalent 6 Million Events/week. CPU/wall low at 55%. Most reasons of drop internal to D0. An OSG-side reason: pre-emption at CMS sites. D0 workflow is not designed to handle pre-emption.

   * Fermi-VO -- Planning ongoing within FNAL to possibly increase capacity of Fermi-VO resources in long term. E.g., it was at 99% capacity last month. Impact may be on CDF.

   * CDF -- Production average at 150,000 hours/day, localized at Fermi resources. Have asked CDF Mgt to think about opportunistic usage across OSG.

---+++ VOs with limited activity

   * !IceCube -- Work in progress with !IceCube simulation team (P. Desiati, J. Velez, S. Barnet), GLOW and UCSD site teams. GLOW is setting up a glidein schedd, to port !IceCube jobs for glideinWMS. Short-term plan is to use Squid (not SRM) to minimize failure modes. 

   * nanoHUB -- Consumption low in last 3 weeks due to vacation. Will confirm nanoHUB&#39;s intent to ramp up.

   * DES -- Increasing production at Fermi resources. Average 2000 hours/day.

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2009August10][Previous Meeting Minutes]]
   * No BDII Interruptions during the week of August 10th-16th

---+++ Operations This Week
   * pyOpenSSL issue causes problems with RSV records on resources that do not have pyOpenSSL on system by default. This causes the Gratia transfer mechanism used by RSV to fail. VDT is testing the fix in the ITB.
   * Another notification went out to update OIM contact information. If you have not yet done this, please do so. (366 Contacts, 240 not Confirmed)
   * We&#39;ve been contacting site administrators to turn up RSV reporting on all resources. (Of 30 original tickets, 14 remain)
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled release August 28th.

---+++ Future Events
   * September Machine Room Move in Bloomington September 19 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG. This could be delayed until October 17th if it benefits anyone in the collaboration, the original date was picked with the idea of a October LCH turn up.

---+++ Test !MyOSG 1.6 Message

&lt;verbatim&gt;
OSG Integration, Gratia, and Metrics,

We are finishing up on MyOSG 1.6 and would like to do testing before  
releasing into production. Here is the change log.

* Added Resource Group pages. Left original Resource pages(/ 
wizardXXXX) for backward compatibility but removed it from the main  
menu. We will gradually phase out the Resource pages.
* Changed various inter-page links to point to the new resource group  
pages (instead of resource pages)
* Changed the way item selectors worked. Previously it was a big list  
of checkboxes. Now user can search the item by typing the name, or hit  
down key to show the entire list. Applied this selector to everywhere
that makes sense except the old resource page.
* Updated so that metric detail is now pulled directly from Gratia  
(MyOSG db is projected to reach its limit within the end of year, and  
this allows MyOSG db to scale beyond the horizon)
* Added &quot;User contributed MyOSG view&quot; section on the home page which  
pulls content from one of our Twiki pages.

The new release is available at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. I&#39;d like to ask  
for your help testing the new changes to be sure they do not affect  
Accounting, Metrics, or other usage of the MyOSG site. One specific  
issue we&#39;d like your feedback on is if you are pulling XML from MyOSG,  
please make sure that you test it against myosg-itb by modifying your  
URL from myosg.grid to myosg-itb.grid with the rest of the URL still  
in tact. Also, be sure to try our new Resource Group pages which is a  
rewrite of original Resource pages and uses correct OIM hierarchy.  
Eventually we should all be using Resource Group pages to create new  
MyOSG queries and XML URLs.

Barring any issues that would prevent release into production we are  
planning an August 28th release. Please contact us if you have any  
questions or find any issues with the MyOSG 1.6 update.

Thanks,
Rob
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

---++ Security (Mine)
   * feedback received from site admins meeting
   * started calling the sites. there are several worries. we will post those on security twiki. 
   * ogf workshop is going on fine
   * GOC received a certificate , a commercial one for CA cache. security will write a transition plan for https 

   * oim contact updates are going on. few people have updated. see list of contacts who updated from Quick. security team will contact security contacts directly. if needed, one-by-one 
   * we had a SEVERE linux kernel vulnerability. the announcement we sent out did not go out to all of the contacts. we have to test our announcement tool again.
