      * US ATLAS production during the last week was very stable, at the average level around 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.1M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 91%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 350~500TB/day at BNL T1.

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)


---++ Software (Alain)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Testing SHA2:
      * Finished osg-test with personal and host certificates without new errors (bestman errors known)
      * Testing GUMS (getting errors and trying to identify)
      * Tracked in [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-739][JIRA]]
      * Table of tests at SoftwareTeam.Sha2Support
   

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.8 / 1.2.29
      *       44 (-1) OSG 3.x (      13 are 3.1.8)
      *       59 (2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      21 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        0 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
There are tickets open to update sites with OSG older than 1.2.25. Sites are listed in sheet 2 of
[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgAEBtLAIsw_dE5sVFZ3dGFZcE1wX3F6aXFRTDJRS1E#gid=1][this document]].

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * WLCG CMS Incident Drill is ongoing this week. 10 US Tier2 sites as well as Glideinwms Frontend and factory operators are participating. Glidein FrontEnd at UCSD and Factories are at GOC Fermilab and UCSD and CERN. All US resources are coordinated by OSG sec team. Goal is to testing all data analysis job submission mechanisms in US and EU. A good test of glidein wms and crab tools; understanding how to trace end user jobs.
