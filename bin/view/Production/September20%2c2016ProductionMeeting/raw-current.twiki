---++ Security
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Vulnerability reported in MySQL application [[http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.html][CVE-2016-6662]]. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges and gain control of the server hosting the affected version of MySQL. 
         * A related and undisclosed vulnerability CVE-2016-6663 will be published shortly. &quot;The undisclosed vulnerability makes it easy for certain attackers to create /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf file with arbitrary contents without the FILE privilege requirement.&quot;
      * A vulnerability has been found in the canl-c library which is used by gridsite where it is possible for a user with any certificate, including a self-created one, to impersonate any other user. Reported by EGI SVG, rated as “Critical”.
         * Services using the mentioned library and where authorization depends only on Distinguished Names (DN) are affected.
