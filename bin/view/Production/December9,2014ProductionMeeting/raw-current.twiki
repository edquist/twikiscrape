   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not stable, at the average level of 15-30K running job slots, with the services put offline on Monday for the dq2 to rucio dataset catalog transition. And there was long and hard recovery with issues both in production system and new rucio dataset catalog system. Still ongoing.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilots, 1.4M walltime hours, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 59%.
      * 1.7 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate was ~200TB/day, at BNL Tier1, for last week

In addition to the items below, this release contains a rebuild of the OSG
!MyProxy package for both OSG 3.1 and 3.2.  It avoids installation and update
problems that started occurring last Friday and that are due to a change in
another repository (EPEL).  Although this update was required to make Yum work
correctly, no action is required on your part.

   * OSG 3.2.18
      * HTCondor CE updates (see release notes)
      * HTCondor 8.2.4 with patches (see release notes)
      * GUMS 1.4.1 - Spruce up &quot;Ban Users&quot; UI
      * gratia probe updates - dCache probe keeps up, report proper VOName
      * VO Package v58 - Remove old CERN VOMS addresses, Fermilab Analysis Role
      * CA Certificate update to IGTF 1.61
      * HTCondor 8.3.1 in the upcoming repository (with known issues)
      * Several other minor bug fixes

   * OSG 3.1.42
      * VO Package v58 - Remove old CERN VOMS addresses, Fermilab Analysis Role
      * CA Certificate update to IGTF 1.61

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

   * The new CE at Syracuse is operational and accepting jobs from all VOs (the name of the CE is SU-OG-CE).  Current usage can be seen at http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/site?facility=SU-OG-CE

   * In the last 12 months we accessed more than 120M opportunistic hours; the query below only counts the major opportunistic VOs: osg, gluex, glow, engage, sbgrid, and hcc.  But there is additional opportunistic usage from others (e.g. NOVA) which is harder to quantify …: &lt;br /&gt;

   * In the most recent quarter, we have been averaging about 3M hours per week; a year ago we were averaging  about 2M hours per week: &lt;br /&gt;

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * HIAST CA, which has been down for almost 3 months, will be removed from the OSG CA bundle with the next release. Unfortunately that will be January, not today&#39;s release.
