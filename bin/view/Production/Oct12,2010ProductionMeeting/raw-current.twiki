---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Time varying consistency checks between the BDII versions are needed from Burt&#39;s team as the next step in the possible BDII upgrade from v4 to v5. Should have these tests completed in the next few days. (Burt)
   * Rob to discuss with Lawrence (next week at CHEP) the need for getting Soichi&#39;s fix for keeping the BDII update process from dying into a release version ASAP. 
   * Opportunistic usage back at roughly 70% (LIGO), and the overall peak OSG usage is holding at ~8M hours per week. 
   * Pakiti now being used to monitor security patches on the CMS Tier-3 sites. (Mine) 

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Mine, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * 337 khour/day, 92% success
   * CHEP is coming.  I don&#39;t know if this means more processing or less processing...
   * LHC has delivered about 17.5 pb^-1 (around 16 pb^-1 recorded @ CMS)

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)
   * Armen and Xin are away and will not be on the meeting today.

   * General production status
      * LHC is continuing to deliver good luminosity. Some hiccups though - there are some days without a beam. Overall collected luminosity for ATLAS is 15 pb-1. ATLAS production was very stable during the last week at the level of 9-10k running jobs all the time, simulation jobs, as well as reprocessing jobs, testing the new release for the upcoming reprocessing campaign. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 89%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.5K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 218K jobs per day
         * failed 339K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 82%, walltime - 94%. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 300~400TB/day.

      * Will probably move to ITB testing next week

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.14
      *       90 (7) OSG 1.2.X resources (       9 are 1.2.14)
      *        4 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        5 (1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
This week 10/14 there will be a site coordination meeting
   * Special topic: the experience of South American sites

---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Spending time on patching and monitoring status of the latest 64-bit kernel vulnerability
   * sites are doing very well. Except for a small number , everyone is on track for completing patches. 
   * Please update the contact information in OIM. We are doing an audit of security contacts in OIM. the information should be updated once a year. Many OSG staff has not updated for over a year. Please make sure to update yours.
