---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Tim, Suchandra, Tony, Marco, Rob Q., Kevin, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 16,438 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~625 TB/day


---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC operation last week was overall stable. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~13.7 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was very stable, at the average level around 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.0M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 86%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 350~500TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * GT5 issue with OSG 3 CE installation at USATLAS sites
         * GOC ticket https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=12486
         * After the patch, site hasn&#39;t seen any similar issue;
         * Globus team is still looking into other issues found there;
         * Once the current patch is in the new stable release, we plan to upgrade current USATLAS OSG3 sites to the latest version, and run for a month or so. If things are stable, we can move forward with wider adoption. If not stable, we start another round of troubleshooting.

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

   * No release on 28/Aug
   * 30/Aug Emergency maintenance on OSG-JIRA
      * Containment in 10 minutes
      * Completion in one hour.
   * Have begin testing of SHA-2 signed certificates on ITB machines.
      * twiki-itb tested previously, all is well to date.
      * _Steve reports testing going well at FNAL, encountered problems with j-globus_
   * ITB release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/goc-service-update-tuesday-september.html][Release note]]
   * OS updates on GOC internal machines, reboots required
   * !MyOSG
      * Increase CPU (From 1 to 2)
      * Remove OSG-XSEDE from status board
      * Cosmetic changes and browser dependent fixes
   * OIM
      * Many changes associated with new PKI
      * Minor bug fixes and quieting of spurious error mesages
   * Reports
      * Adding sites to Installed Capacity Report
      * Moving report generation script from OIM to reports.grid.
   * RSV-client
      * Moving GOC internal RSV-client to production status machine. 
      * Many changes to OIM associated with new PKI
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded ITB Factory Condor to 7.8.3
      * UCSD participated in Site Security Challenge 6 (SSC6).
         * It mostly required effort from the CMS VO Frontend side, and no action was required on the Factory level.
         * We remained ready to ban the CMS Frontend or blacklist submission to particular sites, but it was not requested.
         * We can still dig through glidein log files if the CMS Frontend operator (James Letts) needs it for forensics.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/doe-grids-service-transition.html][DoE grids certificate transition]] announcement.
   * Production release
   * Announcing change to morning RSV report
      * [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/2012/09/09/MoU_WLCG_Report-2012-09-09.html][The replacement report]] is available for evaluation/comments.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgrade UCSD Factory Condor to 7.8.3 this week
      * Upgrade GOC Production Factory Condor to 7.8.2 on Tomorrow&#39;s production window

---+++ Follow Up on Upgrade Request (Pre 1.2.25)
   * 33 Resources Identified by Marco
      * Ticket for each resources opened on August 29th
      * Closed 13 (Updated)
      * Response from 15 (Not Updated)
      * 2 in Maintenance (Upgrading)
      * 3 No Response (Upgrade Status Unknown)
         * CNIC-OSG (Anand???)
         * HU_ATLAS_Tier2
         * osu-cms

---+++ Production Issue with vomses file and DOEGrids/DigiCert Transition
   * vomses file contains the DN for each VOMS service
   * This will mean an update in the VO Package (as things stand now)
      * Resources are historically slow picking up new VO Package Releases
   * This will break voms-proxy-init and potentially cause issues for submitters

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)


---++ Software (Tim)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Continuing SHA2 Testing:
      * Finishing up gratia server testing
      * Continuing glideinwms testing

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.8 / 1.2.29
      *       45 (1) OSG 3.x (      17 are 3.1.8)
      *       57 (-2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      22 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        0 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
   * Looking into the next year, !GlueX is requesting 5M opportunstic hours for simulations (in the last year they used about 5.9M).  To maximize success we will look to add additional sites (Nebraska and Purdue plus ??) for vo=GlueX (they already use glideinWMS)

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * SSC6 security challenge last week. All OSG sites quickly responded and got sites blocked. Some interesting forensics reported back. Did not see jobs submitted via glideins, apparently there was a problem submitting them. Waiting to hear if we missed any activity or not from EGI.
