---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not stable, at the average level of 15-30K running job slots. Still issues from the transition to the new production system and new dataset catalog system. Also problems with BNL FTS3 over weekend. Also BNL datadisk was almost full (due to pause in deletion system and almost 100% primary data content), which was limiting production.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.8M pilots, 2.3M walltime hours, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 65%.
      * 1.8 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate was ~ TB/day, at BNL Tier1, for last week
      * The gratia link http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/bysite is showing no transfers for BNL since Dec.10 .

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

We are working to enable GLOW to run on Fermigrid (no user cert attached).

Syracuse Univerity CE appears to be running well; http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/site?facility=SU-OG-CE

In the last week, the OSG VO has averaged ~500K hours per day; filling in the gaps around temporary drop in usage by other VOs.  We could probably access more but are demand limited (our users don&#39;t have more work to submit at this point).  

On Thursday, we have a phone call with FIU who is interested in joining OSG to share a 2000 core cluster.


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * None
   * Operations
      * CIlogon Basic CA ProtectNetwork collaboration is ending. ProtectNetwork IdP has been a home for the homeless type IdP for the users whose organizations are not in InCommon. ProtectNetwork will no longer provide this service to CILOgon Basic CA. forthose of OSG users who have CIlogon certs via ProtectNetwork will have to find another IdP tha can issue certs for them. Fermilab is instantiating such an IdP for its users. Fermilab has directions for its users to use its new IdP. The ProtectNetwork will stop working for CIlogon end of December. 

      * Repeating the incident drill for the HTCondor CE. The first time was a very simple test. We are now testing whether the site amdin can trace back a random job to the user, as well as tracing the jobs belonging to a certificate owner. We will also trace a job submitted form the glidein system. Should be finished completely before the end of this month.
   * Some security issues were discovered and being fixed in oasis service. The registration process should ask for 2 contacts: vo content manager (understands the code) and oasis manager (manages the service). We realized that we only had a single contact oasis manager. we are changing the process to make sure we also have a content manager.
