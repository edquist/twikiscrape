   * CMS Production average/day:
      * 770,415 hours
      * 846,006 pilots

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was mostly stable, at the average level of 34-57K running job slots, with lower end at the very beginning of the week, with not enough tasks, then quickly recovering again at high levels.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilots, 4.7M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 90% (for single core jobs)
      * 2.0 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate is ~ 450TB/day at BNL tier1 last week. 
   * To check current status of real jobs running on USATLAS sites, one can go to panda monitor: 
      * Production jobs --- http://bigpanda.cern.ch/dash/production/?cloudview=region#cloud_US
      * Analysis jobs --- http://bigpanda.cern.ch/dash/analysis/#cloud_US
      * Any other available options from the menu on top of that panda monitor page 

---++ FIFE - !FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya)
   * !Mu2e 2.2M Wall Hours, 333.5K jobs 99.9% success rate
   * !NOvA 151K  Wall Duration , 40.9K jobs, 14% success rate, SMU hardware problems
   * Pre-emption at Nebraska and Caltech, seems to correspond to spikes in CMS production.
