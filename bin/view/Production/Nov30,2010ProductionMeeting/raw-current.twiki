-- Main.DanFraser - 15 Nov 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * A new BDII v5 (IS4) has been setup on bare hardware (not a VM) and should be ready for testing on Thursday. Assuming that CMS and Atlas are able to test this and send approval, the plan will be to put it into the production round robin next Tuesday. (Rob, Burt, Xin)
   * The GOC is coordinating with CERN on restoring the timeout back to 30s from the current 120s. The plan is to try and do this at a time when the GOC can watch closely for any initial problems.  (Rob)
   * There is a significant number of sites (5-10) that have been more than a month in installing critical patches. Mine to discuss with the OSG ET. 
   * The OSG Council has requested a breakout of usage by science-type. We have data from the largest VOs, but still need a breakdown from GLOW.  (Dan to follow up.)

---++ Attendees:
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Tony, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * ~924 khours/day
      * 19696 jobs/day
      * 89% success

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~362 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC continue to run stable heavy ion collisions. Collected luminosity has more than doubled during the last week and is now 6800 mb-1. The interesting physics results on jet asymmetry at heavy ion collisions, mentioned last week, got endorsed by ATLAS collaboration, the paper was ready and submitted for publication at PRL Thursday, and was accepted the very next day. Also dedicated CERN Press Release on Friday. ATLAS data reprocessing campaign successfully finished end of the week. At the moment majority of running jobs are Geant4 simulation tasks. Production is quite stable at the level of ~10k running jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 83%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * Failure rate raised on Nov 23, due to some software installation problem (some compat libraries were accidentally deleted). 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 400~500TB/day.
   * Issues

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.15
      *       93 (-2) OSG 1.2.X resources (      17 are 1.2.15)
      *        4 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        4 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Site&#39;s patching status. There are still around ten sites which has no applied the critical patches. It is over a month since the patches are out. We will hold a ET meeting this Th to discuss what to do about these sites. All of the sites received individual email reminders and questions on why they are late on their updates. 
   * Changes to the AUP. JSPG came up with a newer version. No problems with our compatibility. Will discuss at this week&#39;s ET
   * Certificate layout changes will roll soon. We will follow a tiered roll-out plan. First most experienced production sites will take the new cache. This way if there is a problem we can quickly roll back. 
  


---++ Metrics (Brian)

For once, a few production-related metrics issues:
   * We&#39;ve noticed the NERSC allocation is about half-used.  How would OSG like to go about managing the remaining hours?  Does it want to think more deeply about how it allocates this between VOs?  Or does it simply want to see it utilized?
   * For VOs that span multiple fields of science, Metrics keeps a mapping of &quot;user DN&quot; to &quot;field of science&quot;.  We&#39;re missing such a mapping from GLOW.
