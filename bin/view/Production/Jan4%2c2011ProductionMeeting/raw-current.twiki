-- Main.DanFraser - 30 Nov 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Production continued steadily over the break; no major issues reported.
   * The current filter on the Production BDII excludes SE-only sites. It was agreed to go ahead and update the filter at the next Change cycle on Tuesday.
   * The Operations team has not yet found a way to successfully restart the BDII v5. Instead it needs to be rebuilt whenever a restart is needed. Ops will work with CERN to see if there is a workaround to this problem. However, until this is resolved BDII v5 is not targeted to be put into production. 

---++ Attendees:
   * Armen, Britta, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Last week: 352 khour/day, 89% success.  (2010 average: 227 khour/day).

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * ATLAS production during the week was quite stable at the level of 12k running jobs, mainly simulation type. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.88M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 86%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.5M managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 216K jobs per day
         * failed 108K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  93%
      * Failure rate is at normal level. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~400TB/day
   * Issues

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Bug in BDII RSV Probe caused RSV tests to fail from Midnight on 1/1 until ~22:00. This was noticed by the GOC but not considered critical since the BDII was working fine.

---+++ Operations This Week

   * Nothing in the works, will do a RSV release next week to remove dependency on UNL.
   * Await results of BDII testing before adding is4 to DNS RR.
      * Some complications when logs were turned on today and BDII was restarted. 
      * We are trying to schedule a time tomorrow to talk to CERN BDII folk about how they addressed this issue. 
   * Current filter on is1 and is2 exclude SE Only resources, should this be fixed in the next maintenance window?

---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Testing VTB release for OSG 1.2.17
      * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p24.html][Changes]]
      * Resolved most significant issues, will go to ITB release tomorrow.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.16
      *       99 (2) OSG 1.2.X resources (       6 are 1.2.16)
      *        7 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        6 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources

Site coordination meeting next week, 1/13
