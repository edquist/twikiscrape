-- Main.DanFraser - 04 Apr 2012
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * A number of sites are hitting what appears to be a Globus bug (GASS cache) in the OSG 3.0.10 release causing significant job failures. Several sites are working on downgrading from this version. OSG needs to have a more defined path in general for users who need to downgrade. Dan to follow up with Alain on both of these issues.
   * There was a problem with Condor-G / GRAM at the Midwest Tier-2 site that was causing jobs to pile up in the pending queue. The Condor team, plus others from OSG are looking into the problem. (Xin)
