-- Main.DanFraser - 07 Aug 2012
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * We are planning to strongly urge sites with versions less than 1.2.25 to upgrade due to root level security vulnerabilities. (1.2.25 is the gratia vulnerability fix.) Marco and Dan to draft a notice and a ticket will be sent to these sites to help with tracking. 
   * Along the same lines, the Condor vulnerability is also a serious root level vulnerability. Mine has sent notices urging sites to update their Condor version. Brian to work with Mine to write a script that users can run to determine if they are vulnerable. 
   * Since the OSG has transitioned to more of a glide-in centric system, we need to have further discussions at the ET level to determine how much pressure we should apply to sites that have serious vulnerabilities. 
   * Bosco v1 was released in beta this week. Suchandra to test this system as an OSG ITB site.
   * Tim Cartwright is temporarily replacing Alain as the OSG software coordinator since Alain&#39;s last day is Sept. 7.

      * Gratia report: 1.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.3M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 350~450TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * GT5 issue with OSG 3 CE installation at USATLAS sites
         * GOC ticket https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=12486

   * Partial ITB release, will make additional changes and send release note next week.
   * RSV collector problems, traced to large log files associated with Gratia version mismatch rsv/rsv-itb
      * replication suspended, log files compressed, problem eliminated. 
      * Issue has been resolved, root cause identified as configuration error.
   *  WMS Glide In Factory
      * ITB Glidein Factory had LDAP connection problems after last Tuesday&#39;s reboot.  I rebooted it again on Thursday (8-23) and the problem cleared up.
         * This cleared on on reboot. 
         * Problems upgrading Condor, Jeff and Tom will talk after this call. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * No release
   * Will begin testing of SHA-2 signed certificates on ITB machines.
      * _Steve reports testing going well at FNAL, encountered problems with j-globus_
   * No Operations Meeting next week due to the Holiday
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Request from Chander to Update Collector to latest Gratia Release

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)

   * Bosco v1 was released in beta on Monday: http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/BoSCO

---++ Software (Alain)

Only one thing of note this week: Tim Cartwright will become the Interim OSG Software Coordinator after Alain leaves on September 7th. 

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * SHA2 testing
      * osg-test using SHA2 based personal certs appears to be working on SL5/SL6
      * Doing the same using SHA2 based host certs and testing gums using SHA2 based host certs
   * Looking at installation and configuration issues at TTU and a few other sites (CIT, UTA?, AGLT2?)
   * Doing SLURM testing as well
      

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.7 / 1.2.29
      *       45 (8) OSG 3.x (       5 are 3.1.7)
      *       57 (-3) OSG 1.2.X resources (      12 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6):   CNIC-OSG, rutgers-cms
      *        0 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
   * User Support starting to work with BNL PET group (call with them on Monday) who want to use OSG for simulation of medical imaging apparatus: http://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/osg_summary.ppt 
   * Baker lab flocking to UCSD completed; in-production.  Now we need to configure gratia probe
   * Call tomorrow with North Dakota State University (NDSU) to help them join OSG

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * Heard only form 12 sites about the condor upgrade. Looking for ways to identify sites needing upgrade and encouraging them. 
   * Operations:
      * CMS Incident Drill is coordinated for September 4. It tests data analysis framework including Glidein FrontEnd and Factories. 8 Tier2 from OSG will participate. Security team contacted the sites and glidein operators, everyone accepted to participate.
      * Started issuing test SHA-2 certs from DOEgrids CA. We are very grateful for the help. they put up a test CA interface that run alongside the production CA for OSG to request and approve test certs. 
      * Concerning the SHA-2 transition, we sent emails to VO and sites. Only heard from Atlas and CMS, and we are helping them get their tests going. have not heard form other VOs. what shouldwe do?
