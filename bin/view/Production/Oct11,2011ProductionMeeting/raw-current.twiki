   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.3M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 85% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.0M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200T~400T/day last week, normal. 
   * Issues
      * Opportunistic usage for OSG VOs at USATLAS sites: 
         * SLAC enables HCC and GLOW jobs, problem with Engage -- gridftp from the worker node.

      * Cosmetic changes to Display, improved look and feel for mobile devices
      * Minor changes and additions to MyOSG
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * DNS planned outage had some unexpected effects, rebooted gratia collectors for a few minutes around 8:30 on Thursday.
      * Ongoing practice upgrades to optimize upgrade time.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * On Wed. Oct. 5 we discovered a serious glideinWMS bug where glideins were not respecting retire times.
         * This allowed glideins to run indefinitely on sites.
         * We put the GOC Factory in unscheduled down time and notified Scott due to it being high priority.
         * We first applied a patch to UCSD and when we were sure it fixed the problem we patched the GOC factory and brought it back up Thurs. morning Oct. 6
         * We removed all glideins from before the patch to ensure there are no more long running glideins.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
