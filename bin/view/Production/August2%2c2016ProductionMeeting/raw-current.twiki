---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status. 
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was stable most of the time, at the average level of 40-60K running job slots, with not enough tasks to keep the production full all the time.      
   * Job statistics for last week.     
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilots, 4.5M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 74% (for single core jobs)
      * 1.9M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  

---++ FIFE - !Fabric for Frontier Experiments (Tanya)

   * Low demand from FIFE experiments this month since most results for summer conferences are already out. The summer beam shutdown also started, so nightly production from experiments will also be somewhat lighter than usual.
   * MINOS+ experiment has ended its final run. 
   * MINOS+ looking to begin testing their allocation at Stampede soon.

      * ITB release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2016/08/goc-service-update-tuesday-august-9th.html][release note]]
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * 7/31/16 @22:23 gums2 went down and the primary got paged.  gums2 is the host for gums.fnal.gov.
      * 7/31/16 @22:44 gums2 was brought back up by secondary and check_mk alarms cleared.
      * This morning at around 7:38am we noticed that gums.fnal.gov was not responding.  Upon further investigation it appears that when gums2  rebooted the OS decided to rename the network interface and the device that gums.fnal.gov was assigned to was not setup to be &#39;ON&quot; at boot time.
      * Requests started getting on gums.fnal.gov and jobs started running by ~8:45am.  However, on some of the CEs, a service restart was required to get jobs flowing again.
      * To prevent this issues happening in future, we are:
      * Using puppet to setup the device configuration such that the device name is fixed and will not change again
      * better monitor service ip availability (gums.fnal.gov and gums-crit.fnal.gov)

   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Performed testing on OSG BDII ITB regarding the vulnerability announced through EGI SVG for OpenLDAP. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote DoS. By sending a tampered message, OpenLDAP daemon crashes. BDII service is coming to its end of life next March 31st , 2017. It was decided to do not apply the security updates for OpenLDAP. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30708
      * Vulnerabilities reported in Perfsonar were reported last week: Shawn McKee already confirmed that the version installed in OSG&#39;s Perfsonar instances is 3.5.1.4 contains the security updates. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30595
   * Operations
      * Globus GSSAPI Name compatibility: Met with Scott Teige and Mats Selmecy. Checking if OSG known services are compliant with the new strict mode implementation. This new implementation is coming into OSG Software stack on September release.   
      * Used condor_ce_trace and condor_ce_run to submit jobs directly to CEs: &quot;Failed to ping &lt;131.94.55.228:9619&gt;; authorization check exited with code 1.&quot;
