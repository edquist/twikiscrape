---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week

   * BDII instability event on 26/Nov. The problem was traced back to a IP renumbering project which had unforeseen effects on our internal DNS and LDAP. As soon as the issue was identified, the maintenance was stopped and service was rolled back to the pre-maintenance configuration. This was complicated by the need to roll back several RPM packages. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/10/indianapolis-bdii-is2gridiuedu.html][Notification Link]]
   * OIM outage 14:30-18:36 29/Nov. Tomcat failed without generating a log entry. Tomcat restarted, service is running.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/10/goc-service-upgrade-tuesday-october_19.html][Production release]] service upgrade announcement
   * First top level BDII at the GOC meeting, a draft [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/rept.pdf][proposal document]] is here.
   * Friday 10/29 between 15:00 and 23:00 CST the gratia database had significant record backlog, self-corrected (GOC 9458).  Investigated condor-boinc probe at Clemson (GOC 9457) but concluded it wasn&#39;t related.
   * Monday 11/1 Soichi reports lots of timeouts for GOC display to access Gratia reporting database, investigating but no obvious problems on our end.

---+++ Operations This Week

   * ITB release, a few bug fixes, no new feature releases.
   * Will announce a date for the move to x509 authentication for TWiki (November 23, with special announcements). 
   * Second top level BDII meeting: 10 AM US Eastern, Tuesday, 2/Nov, Readytalk, 866-740-1260 US, 303-248-0285 International Access Code: 8266135 (Reminder, Europe just changed to daylight savings time, the US has not changed yet).
   * Expect reboot of production gratia machines to pick up new kernel today 11/1/10.


---++ Engage (Mats, John)

15 users utilized 44 sites

78843 jobs total (70553 / 8290 = 89.5% success)

206362.4 wall clock hours total (177682.7 / 28679.7 = 86.1% success)

I will not be able to make it to the meeting today. engage-central.renci.org (main OSGMM instance for Engage) has been moved successfully to the new VM.


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Probably going to VDT /VTB testing later this week
   * Working on finishing up ITB robot testing infrastructure

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.14
      *       93 (3) OSG 1.2.X resources (      14 are 1.2.14)
      *        4 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        4 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
Next week 11/11 there will be a site coordination meeting
   * SiteCoordination.SitesCoord101111
   * Phone: # 866-740-1260, code 8349885#

---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Marcia)

---+++ KISTI

   * Gabriele&#39;s trip went well; KISTI interested in being a stronger player for OSG; strong team support.
   * Operational processes could improve. Not many processes/procedures (i.e., SLAs, incident escalation, SLAs, problem &amp; change managment)
   * One team member tentatively agreed to a term of 6 months at Fermilab in summer.
   * PBS problems fixed as of last week; no clear root cause (a Nov. 1 report from Margaret Votava, Fermilab Running Experiments Dept Head, indicated the problems have resumed). 
   * CDF investigating ways to speed up tranfers back by doing in parallel.
   * Site opened to Fermilab VO, which is testing

---+++ GROW

   * Daniel Squires from Iowa Computer Science department is newly on board. Iowa has purchased new hardware and plans on purchasing more pending funding. Daniel is just getting his feet wet and is looking for guidance.

---+++ GLUE-X

   * Still noticing slowness in job response times.
   * GOC Ticket #9142 still open--D0 jobs failing. Richard Jones and D0 team are in touch, and both are dedicated to finding solution.
   * GLUE-X productions is ramping up. Currently doing production on !UConn only, but plan to expand after implementing !glideinWMS.




---++ Security (Mine)
   * No emergencies, vulnerabilities or incidents
   * Everyone received email form OIM to update their contact information. Please do it before you forget. 
   * Galois, a small business, won a DOE grant to deliver identity management solutions for the science VOs. I helped them connect with OSG VOs. Please note that this is not OSG work -- I am just providing the bridge between them and the VOs. Galois has finished writing their problem definitions document. They will send it to OSG VOs. It is entirely up to VOs if they like to send feedback or not.
