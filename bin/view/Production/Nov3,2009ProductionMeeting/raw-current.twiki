      * Waiting for updates from BNL and FNAL on rsv gratia probes
   * Resuming work on ITB testing framework  

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.3
      * 39 OSG 1.2.X resources (18 are 1.2.3)
      * 29 OSG 1.0.X resources (19 are 1.0.4)                                                                                                                                                                  
      * 25 OSG 1.0.0
      * 2 OSG 0.8.0

---++ Engagement (Mats)

9 users utilized 35 sites;

83865 jobs total (76304 / 7561 = 91.0% success);

383331.9 wall clock hours total (357098.6 / 26233.3 = 93.2% success);

I am leaving RENCI Friday Nov 13th. It is not decided yet who in the Trash/Engagement team will attend OSG calls (operations, production, vo-forum, ...). Production will not be affected.


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

---+++ VOs with High Activity

   * D0 -- (i) MC Production average at 80-85,000 hours/day. D0 accounting view recorded an equivalent 14 Million Events/week. This can be erroneous; will verify with D0 MC team when back from vacation. Efficiencies: Job 40%, Wall 80%, CPU/wall 80%. (ii) On Ruth&#39;s suggestion, work to start to understand weekly Analysis and Data Production statistics.

   * CDF -- Preparation for SL 5 migration is ongoing. CDF has setup a separate queue for SL5 to keep SL5 evaluation isolated from production on SL4.

   * Fermi-VO -- Fermilab VO has implemented GIP configuration changes to advertise subcluster parameters e.g., memory, OS versions. Need to make sure to include this in OSG Documentation. As a practical benefit, jobs submitted to !FermiGrid now match and go to the correct OS version (SL 4 or SL 5).

   * DOSAR -- Working as OSG liaison to bring up !GridUNESP (Sao Paolo), a multi-disciplinary state-level effort in Brazil. !GridUNESP has a 2000 core cluster. Have Condor running on it, faced problems running large scale MPI jobs using parallel universe. Condor experts helped resolve; fixed now. Need to make sure to include this in OSG Documentation. Using DOSAR certificates until own VO is up and running. Participating in SC&#39;09 Bandwidth Challenge with new 10GB link.

---+++ VOs with Limited Activity

   * ALICE -- Expecting to ramp up activity in October. Usage dropped in last few months due to lack of internal effort. Twofold plan: (i) To add ALICE site at NERSC onto OSG Intgration Testbed in near term. (ii) Bring up an OSG compute element at LLNL in next few months.

   * !CompBioGrid -- Site now functional; being used by Engage VO to consume cycles. Next stage is application integration of Virtual Cell.

   * !IceCube -- Work in progress with !IceCube simulation team: P. Desiati, J. C. Velez, S. Barnet, GLOW and UCSD site teams. GLOW setup a glidein schedd to port !IceCube jobs for glideinWMS. Short-term plan is to use Squid (not SRM) to minimize failure modes. !IceCube team is porting the jobs. Proof-of-principle glideinWMS basic infrastructure working. (i) To bootstrap, small-scale test jobs were run on several different sites. (ii) Now limiting jobs to UCSD. Avoiding more sites, because exercise is using Dan Bradley&#39;s proxy which can be mapped to CMS VO on a few sites. (iii) Need to start looking into Data/Storage optimizations with Tanya and OSG Storage. Parts of !IceCube team going to visit experiment at South Pole; delays expected.

   * SBGrid/NEBioGrid -- A new NMR application is being pursued. Plan is to sustain increased wall hour rate (100-250 hours/day). Joint partnership between Children&#39;s Hospital and Immune Disease Institute.

   * NYSGrid -- Work ongoing on portal development; based on HUBzero. Updates expected in coming weeks.

   * GPN -- Work ongoing with Engagement.

---+++ General

   * Work ongoing with GOC on getting feedback/approval of VOs on !MyOSG SLA. Key candidates: !FermiGrid, NYSGrid, SBGrid, STAR.

   * Work ongoing with OSG Security to collect input on Identity Management Requirements survey. 15 VOs have responded.
