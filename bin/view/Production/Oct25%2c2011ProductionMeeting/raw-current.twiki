-- Main.DanFraser - 04 Oct 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * CMS is actively testing the BDII v5. If there are no problems for another week, they will go ahead and sign off on transitioning this version to production.(Tony)
   * Atlas is ready to sign off on BDII v5, but has agreed to have the data group test it before making the final call. (Xin)
   * Engage has updated to the new VOMS using the RPM version in production. It was a significant upgrade but was felt to bring significant benefit as well. (Mats)
   * Alain Roy will be participating on the Production call especially during the RPM transition to answer questions and clarify issues.

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Indianapolis BDII Outage 6:12-6:20 (eastern) 19/Oct due to router reboots in IUPUI machine room. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/10/iupui-network-maintenance-october-19.html][Announcement]] 
      * This did not affect WLCG Production data. 
   * ITB release
      * OS updates on ITB machines. Reboots were required.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Huge influx of records on gratia-osg-transfer over weekend slowed down whole gratia reporting, reporting database currently 18 hours behind real time.  Most of records from aglt2.org.  Expect it will catch up in 1-2 days without intervention.
      * Service Now went live, with some problems.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/10/goc-service-update-tuesday-october-25th.html][Release note]]
      * Please be aware the OSG Operations makes reasonable effort to support all major browsers current versions but cannot guarantee proper behavior for all browsers and browser versions.
   * OS updates on production machines. Reboots will be required.
      * BDII Will be DNS RR&#39;d so no external outage is expected. 
   * WLCG Operations Technology Evaluation Group (TEG) kicks off this week.
      * Are there any items OSG Operations should bring to the attention of WLCG Operations?
      * Anything broken? Anything that works well in OSG but not WLCG, or vise-versa? Anything WLCG Operations needs to do differently?
   * We are evaluating the recent JAVA security issue to see if it affects any Operations Services.
      * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuoct2011-443431.html
      * Unless we find evidence of high risk we will update this in the next regularly scheduled maintenance window. 
      * !FermiGrid and Glide-In Operates should also evaluate their risk for OSG Operational Serivices
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Expect Apache/Tomcat patches on ReSS machines this week Wed. 10/26, HA will keep services up.
      * Gratia upgrade still 2-3 weeks off, issues with upgrading reporter code, requested assistance from original report developer.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * _Jeff will provide a list of currently installed front-ends_

---+++ Gratia Review
   * ~1M Hours reported by user /CN=http/cms-xen2.fnal.gov on BU_ATLAS_Tier2
      * Odd that it seems to be a http cert, which would not run jobs.
      * I&#39;ve added this to the [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11141][ticket]]
   * Daily Wallclock Hours Month to Date &lt;br&gt;

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.23
      *       86 (-14) OSG 1.2.X resources (       7 are 1.2.23)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources


---++ User Support (Chander)
GEANT4 wants CVMFS suppport but that is only available at very few sites in OSG. 

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Operational security: 
      *CERN incident is about to close up. No compromise reported on osg sites. 
      * Critical Java vulnerability. Worked with VDT and GOC public facing servers. Also informed OSG participants of the risk. We did not find a critical risk to OSG services. Vulnerability was mostly about clients running Java web start apps and etc.

   * Upcoming operational change. A year ago IGTF had decided to ask all accredited CAs to switch using sha-2 by 2012. before the CAs actually make the switch, we should test our middleware against the sha-2 and openssl 0.9.8. This is different than ca layout changes we worked on although two are related. Will ask software/ITB teams help in testing our infrastructure with new certs

   * Working on risk assessment of our VDT software build infrastructure. 
   * No new vulnerabilities.
