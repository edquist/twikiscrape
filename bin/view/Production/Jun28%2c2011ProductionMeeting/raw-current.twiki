         * 1.1M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300~400TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC has been running fine, still SLAC and NET T2s to add to support list
         * Engage: no update last week
