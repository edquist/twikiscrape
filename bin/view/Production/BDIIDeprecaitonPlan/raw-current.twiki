---++ Introduction

The OSG Berkeley Data Information Index (BDII) will no longer be covered under OSG Operations Service Level Agreements as of March 31, 2017. This plan will describe the steps necessary for a smooth transition to deprecation. 

The transition team will consist of members of the OSG Operations, Technology, and Software teams as well as members from ATLAS and CMS.

---++ Scope

The OSG BDII and OSG-WLCG Interoperations BDII Aggregators. This includes the services receiving information at the addresses is.grid.iu.edu:2170 and is.grid.iu.edu:2180 and the publication methods from OSG CEs to the BDII Aggregator. No other instances of the BDII are covered under this retirement. 

---++ Risks

   * Transitioning before a stakeholder has fully moved to using information in the new HTCondor Collector thus cutting off important data from our resources providers or users. 
      * Ongoing conversations with the primary WLCG stakeholders lead us to believe CMS has fully transitioned away from using the BDII. ATLAS has also taken some steps to removed dependencies, confirmation of fully disconnecting to BDII information is necessary. 
   * Operational services that consume this data not fully removed from circulation. 

---++ Strategies

At the end of the day GMT March 31, 2017 the BDII SLA will be retired. This will leave no operational responsibilities for continuing service delivery by OSG Operations. Leading up to this retirement OSG Operations will continue to monitor usage to be sure there are no lingering users that might be affected by the deprecation.  

---++ Transition Schedule, Tasks, and Activities

This is an estimated timeline and will be adjusted based on transition activities. However, the final End of SLA date is firm.
