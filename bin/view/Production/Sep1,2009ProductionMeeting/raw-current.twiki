 The Report is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

Action/Significant Items:
   * Batch system failures due to Gratia noted last week have been fixed, and patches sent to the repository for testing. CMS to test this week.
   * CMS noted that Gratia is not marking jobs as failures when they are removed for exceeding the memory limit. Brian/Dan to follow up.
   * The dCache accounting probe finally caught up at BNL. hooray!
   * Gratia RSV probe now in ITB testing.
   * VORS was deprecated on Aug 24. No issues so far.

Attendees:

   * Mine, Chander, Britta, Rob, Marco, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Abhishek

---++CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 182 khour/day, 95% success. CPU/wallclock at 73%.
   * Storage: Tier 1 transferred 1.3 PB last week (peak of 400 TB/day). Tier 2s transferred 300 TB (peak: 94 TB/day). Probes still not functional yet at MIT, UERJ. Florida still missing.
   * OSG: No change again: we have 3 CEs at OSG 1.2 (both Nebraska and cit-gatekeeper2). Tier 3s at 1.2: UCDavis, FIT, UMD, Vanderbilt, UCR.
   * Gratia: Discovered this week that status from the batch system isn&#39;t represented in the summary tables; for instance, condor auto-removing jobs from violating a memory limit in a SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE expression probably looks like a successful job. Job efficiency numbers I have reported thus far do not account for this. *Production Coordinator should talk to Gratia project lead. Brian will get an update and report back.*
   * RSV
      * Followup: What&#39;s the plans for testing and deployment of the gratia RSV probe? *This is moving to the ITB as we speak for testing.*
      * Condor_cron starting up large number of local scheduler jobs (vdt support 5721): update?  (Last response from VDT was Aug 27). *Rob will ping VDT for update*

---++Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * Sorry we won&#39;t attend this meeting in person, as Xin is on vacation, and Armen is in an ATLAS meeting at cern. 

   * Reprocessing jobs are in final test stage on the production system, if no problems bulk reprocessing can start late this week.

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 693K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 93%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 344K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  50K jobs per day
         * failed   49K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 90% for jobs and 97% for walltime

   * Site issue
      * BNL dCache accounting probe catches up in reporting to central collector. Gratia team (Philippe) has done a lot of work on improving the probe for BNL site.

      * 25910.7 wall clock hours total (22239.6 / 3671.0 = 85.8% success);

   * E@OSG reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): This Week: 107,267.72673 Last Week 144,164.36993 
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 10 (-2)

   * Details
      * Robert is testing Condor_G code, hoping to ramp up this week
      * TTU-ANTAEUS upgrades to OSG 1.2 (08/20, 08/21), 08/24 can&#39;t authenticate, MyOSG shows Maintenance

---++Integration (Suchandra)
  * Released osg 1.0.5 update
  * Prepping for testing cycles (gip, lcg utils, rsv probes) 
  * Documentation efforts ongoing 

---++Site Coordination (Marco)
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.1
      * 19 OSG 1.2.X resources (7 are 1.2.1)
      * 33 OSG 1.0.X resources (20 are 1.0.4)
      * 30 OSG 1.0.0

---++Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

---+++ VOs with High Activity

   * D0 -- MC Production average at 50-60,000 hours/day. Equivalent 9.8 Million Events/week. Job efficiency 74%, Wall efficiency 82%,  CPU/wall 74%. Data stage-in discussions ongoing to adapt to changes in Nebraska SE. 
   * Fermi-VO -- Fermi KCA changes are upcoming; packages are being tested, not fully ready yet. In the interim, a few users of Fermi-VO, CDF, D0, ILC, CMS, DES are likely to be affected. [Inviting OSG Security to join weekly VO forum, to advise VOs on more details.]

---+++ VOs with Limited Activity

   * nanoHUB -- Ramping up again after a slowdown. Average 400 hours/day. Influx of &#39;User jobs&#39; also started; in addition to &#39;Application jobs&#39;. nanoHUB is preparing an accounting web to display job-statistics.
   
---+++ General

   * Version 5 of Enterprise Linux on sites -- Different ways to adapt to OS versions; different trade-offs. Encouraging VOs to prepare for the transition.   
   * VORS deprecation and !MyOSG adoption -- Confirmed with affected parties: Fermi-VO/FermiGrid, !NYSGrid, SBGrid/NEBioGrid, STAR. Each is fully ready.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/08/myosg-16-release-notice.html][release on September 1st]]. 
   * September 1, from 9pm - 10pm EDT, the GOC Ticketing system will be down for Footprints server maintenance.

---+++ Future Events
   * Labor Day Holiday Next Monday, No Ops Meeting.
   * Machine Room Move in Bloomington October 17th.

---++Security (Mine)
   * Jay Packard is leaving BNL on 9/11. We must test GUMS RSV probe in ITB before he leaves. This is high priority as no one other than Jay is familiar with the probe.
   * Resource security contact updates are done. I could not reach three site contacts: ian Levesque, Erick warnke and Wei Li. Rob should send me an updated list of contact profiles from OIM. 
   * OSG is planning a Tier-2 security drill. Ken Bloom and Rob Gardner are informed and they agree to announce to cms and atlas sites. We will also email the sites and ask for a suitable date. Week of September 26 and October 2 are candidates; sites can select which specific date they want.
