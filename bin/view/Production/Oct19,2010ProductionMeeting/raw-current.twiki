---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * Lots of folks at CHEP this week.
   * Burt&#39;s team completed one round of data comparisons between BDII v4 and v5. A handful of discrepancies were found including a minor bug in the GIP (Burt to send out an email describing this) and several sites publishing incorrect data (these have been contacted), but no issues were found with the BDII itself. Burt is planning to rerun the comparison data script tomorrow before giving final approval to schedule the change. 
   * LIGO usage is steadily building back up.
   * Marcia Teckenbrock will be taking over Abhishek&#39;s role for reporting VO data on the production call. Welcome Marcia!

---++ Attendees:
   * Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Burt, Marco, Marcia, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Machine in technical stop this week
   * Many experts at CHEP in Taipei
   * 240 khour/day, 87% success

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC had a good week with new record delivered luminosities. Overall ~24pb-1 integrated luminosity delivered. Some injection issues, so a technical stop this week Tu-Fr. ATLAS production was very stable during the last week at the level of 9-10k running jobs all the time, simulation jobs, as well as reprocessing jobs, testing the new release for the upcoming reprocessing campaign. Initial date for the reprocessing start is Oct.27, to last about a month. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 87%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * no report from the shifters team this week 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 300~400TB/day.
   * Issues

   * [[http://tinyurl.com/23uecws][Reliability/Availability of Security Services]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/10/goc-service-upgrade-tuesday-october.html][Production Service Release]] - No Issue

      * Degraded BDII Service was possible but not reported. Did ATLAS see any issues with SAMS testing?

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Quiet week with several people at CHEP
   * Normal ITB Upgrade on Tuesday, October 19th - Change Log will come soon. 
   * Gratia and !ReSS
      *  Will reboot gratia and ress machines for kernel patches on Wed. 10/20

Eric Wicklund said that people are trying to the KISTI site, but jobs are failing. Chander will follow up with Stephan Lammel to find out how big of a priority this is. 

---+++ DO

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9142][Ticket #9142]]: D0 has removed the !UConn SE from configuration because 100% jobs are failing. Richard Jones and Joel Snow will do further testing after Joel is back from vacation. (Richard said SAM obscures meaningful data in log files, so he will send to Joel.)


---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9362][Ticket #9362]]: When small clusters of jobs (~200) were submitted to the the UConn SE, they went through fine, but when clusters increased, Richard started seeing access failures. Dan will discuss who should work this ticket

Production: Richard is looking for a site discovery tool to find out what software is installed. Dan will initiate discussion between Richard and Igor Sfiligoi regarding pilot jobs.

Ports are now open at Jefferson Lab, so glideins will be able to be launched within the firewall.
