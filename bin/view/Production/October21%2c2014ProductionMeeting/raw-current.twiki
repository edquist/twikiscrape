   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not always stable, at the average level of 32-38K running job slots over last week, then dropping to 10K level over weekend, then continuing at 25K level this week. The problem over the weekend was that the VOMS production DB was down, not providing proxy anymore. Also some issues with new release of panda server and FTS bug. This week there were problems with HammerCloud test system (putting all the ATLAS sites offline), as it was creating failed jobs with duplicate output filenames. In addition not enough job load.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 
      * 1.3 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate was ~300TB/day, at BNL Tier1, for last week
