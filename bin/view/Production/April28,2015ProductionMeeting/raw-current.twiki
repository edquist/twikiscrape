---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * None. There is a Drupal vulnerability, but it has no effect on OSG. Anyone using Drupal should check it out. 
   * Operations
      * OSG CA Test Phase. The test phase needs to end by the end of June. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CATestProcedure 
         * Neha is leading the test phase. The functional tests (obtaining, revoking, renewing a cert) are completed. All passed
         * OSG Software. Garhan and Horst completed their tests. Suchandra and Brian Lin will start this week. Xin and Neha will start in couple weeks, too. 
         * OSG services. We want to test the OSG services. Most services are at GOC and Scott needs to coordinate which services should be tested and who will do that. The services at Fermilab has testers assigned. 
         * Fermilab is a special case in this transition. Last time when we transition, they had so many Fermilab services that they need to create an internal project with a separate lead. They may have to do the same thing again this time. We will be as helpful as we can possibly. 
         * VO software. CMS and Atlas are informed of the change. We started planing for testing their software but apparently the VOs do not have test instances and they have to test the production system. This means we have to register our certs with the production VOMS service at CERN. This is a challenge because our CA is not accredited yet therefore CERN will not accept it until then. And they claim there is no test instance for this service. We did not have this problem with DigiCert because DigiCert was accredited before we worked with them. Our solution is we will hopefully gain our accreditation by October and ask VO to test their software in October. Since our transition is planned to start in January and our contract runs through June 2016, this is a good solution.
         * The new CA bundle is being tested and will be released to the production in 2 weeks. We moved the CILogon OpenID CA to a different bundle. We used to provide OpenID CA for LIGO, but probably it is not needed any more. But we will still keep a separate bundle for them.  
      * Oasis security drill is scheduled for May 27th.
