Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.22 / 1.2.32

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

Last week, we enabled Steffen Bass’s group at Duke University to run under the OSG VO; their work is nuclear physics theory.  So far they have been able to get 290K hours in the last 6 days.

We have asked for help from the GFactory team to investigate why a very large number of glide-ins from vo=osg are failing at sites.  In the last week, we have more pilots failing than succeeding and the number of sites affected is large.  We are concerned that there is a “common” problem at the factory or the front-end rather than at sites.  We had lots of work queued up at the OSG-XD front-end (~300K jobs) and OSG as a whole has not been very busy and yet we are not getting an abundance of cores to address our pending work.  We did peak at 10K cores but that has not held up – now down to 5K cores.

---++ Security (Kevin)
* Still waiting for a few security surveys. Sent out emails again last week.
* No new major vulnerabilities the last week. New Redhat/SL kernels due to possible denial of service.
