---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
ATLAS and CMS have increased production; OSG VO opportunistic access has dropped somewhat -- last few days at 10K to 12K cores.
---++ Security (Kevin)
   * No new major vulnerabilities.
   * Hopefully will get digicert sha-2 intermediate cert tested. Created digicert test ca rpm to help with testing. There were some issues with ca filenames not matching between various files, etc.
   * Heard CVMFS blanking test worked. Security team would like to plan a full incident drill with CVMFS in the future to test blanking as well as communications, incldent procedures, etc. Will probably have to be done with test VO/repo though to avoid breaking anything.
