-- Main.DanFraser - 16 Apr 2010
---+++ Attendees : 
   * Rob S., Rik, Mine, Jim, Marco, Dan
---+++ Significant/Action Items:
   * Atlas
      * At the Jamboree, several users were able to try out the T3 test cluster at ANL. Initial feedback was very positive. Users were able to submit and run analysis jobs and reported that the test cluster was actually easier to use than the setup on their home institutions. This is providing confidence in the environment
      * Atlas working with Asoka to create consistent configurations for DQ2 for the T3s
      * One nagging problem is the Xrootd management issue. Problems include:
         * no wildcard delete mechanism
         * it is difficult to find out which files are on which nodes without logging into each node and looking
         * some inconsistency has been noted between files in the composite name space
      * After talking with the developers, the plan is to try using XrootdFS management tool which is FUSE based
      * Another new (still preliminary) development is the ability to use Panda for submitting external jobs on T3s
         * T3s can enable this by setting up a pilot factory to run pilot jobs; these jobs can accept work from the central Panda server
            * was tested on the ANL T3
         * This is still preliminary -- currently there is only an ability to run jobs but no mechanism for pulling back job output
         * This only works on sites running Condor
   * OSG Security
      * Discussed plans to run Pakiti as a centralized tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in installed software
      * CMS would like OSG to do this, but there needs to be a mechanism to limit the viewing portal so that sites can only see their own vulnerabilities and not those of everyone else. This restricted view feature is scheduled for the next release.
         * Mine to find out when this will be available and report back. Then we can figure out next steps.
      * There was some interest in running this on Atlas sites but this is still very preliminary
         * Pakiti would need to run with a Panda interface since in general there is no CE on Atlas sites
         * Also, as noted above the Panda interface is still under development
   * CMS
      * A USCMS meeting on data transfer has been set for May 7 at Brown
         * One session of this will be devoted to T3s
      * Currently there is a centralized PHEDEX server running now at FNAL
      * Several new T3 sites planning to begin installations soon
         * Purdue
         * Actively working with UCLA (Rob)
         * Baylor planning to start on some existing campus hardware, trying to install on CENTOS
         * Brown
         * Alabama (plan on using older IA64 chips)
      * CMS will set up a special support site for CMS T3s. Planned discussion with OSG-GOC later this week to discuss details. 
   * OSG Storage
      * The VM storage test cluster is now up and running again and available for CMS to continue VM performance testing.
   * OSG Software
      * The WLCG client for Atlas has been reduced in size from 1.3GB to 300MB as requested by the Atlas team.
   * Next meeting scheduled for April 21, but Rik &amp; Doug have tight schedules.
