---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

PNNL OSG site is now operational [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/rgcurrentstatus/index?datasource=currentstatus&amp;rg=on&amp;rg_349=on&amp;end_type=now][green]] and [[http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/site?facility=pnnl_osg][running jobs for ILC and Belle]] - they plan to enable the osg vo

Ian Stokes-Rees at Harvard is asking to run HTPC jobs on OSG... what is the status of HTPC on OSG?  who can provide tech support for this customer?

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities
      * Opened tickets with all resources they were missing important condor updates. 
   * Operations: 
      * Cilogon Basic CA testing at GOC ITB services. We successfully tested OIM, Ticket, MyOSG. We had a problem with twiki. We had to ask adding our new Cilogon DNs into OIM account manually. Can we automate this process? Since the user is already authorized with their existing DOEgrids/OSG CA cert, adding another DN does not present a security challenge
      * Debian package for CAs is  supposed to go into production next. 
      * IGTF standard bundle is tested and is ready to go into production. 
      * SHA-2 test will happen again. We received the new ESNet and DOEgrids CAs certs form Dhiva. We will send out an email when we release this. It will happen right after standrad IGTF release goes into production.
