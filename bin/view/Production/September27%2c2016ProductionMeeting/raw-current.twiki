      * OS updates, reboots required
      * Will reconfigure /etc/init.d scripts on glidein to start gwms and condor in the proper order. This should allow the service to restart without manual intervention.
         * Apparently successful, #trials=1
   * Working on monitoring of perfsonar components

---++ Networking (Shawn)
Most OSG networking service running fine.   See https://perfsonar-itb.grid.iu.edu/WLCGperfSONAR/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2FWLCGperfSONAR%2Fcheck_mk%2Fview.py%3Fview_name%3Daggr_all for detailed service status in both ITB and production

One problem is related to certificate issues on psds-itb1 and psds0.   On ITB (psds-itb1) publishing to the CERN message bus stopped around September 22nd.   Edgar traced the problem to a faulty certificate and Shawn opened a ticket (see https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/31358 )   The certificates were updated on psds-itb1 and psds0 but apparently there is another location where an &#39;rsv&#39; user owned certificate needs updating.   Right now publishing the data to the CERN message bus is down until we resolve the certificate issue.

---++ Production Support (Ken)

   * Running flock jobs down to about 5k last Thursday. Possible there was a config error overnight. Back up to normal numbers now.
   * A little progress on CMS and MINOS at Stampede, but neither is working yet.
