---+++ Attendees : 
   * Rik, Doug B., Rob G., Hiro, Tanya, Marco
---+++ Notes:
   * Atlas Notes:
      * Current resource registration in OIM requires attendance of the Monday GOC operation meeting. ATLAS asked to relax this requirement. Marco will submit a ticket.
      * A discussion started (at the meeting) within ATLAS to define the requirements for the different Tier 3:
         * ATLAS will continue this discussion in different venues
         * current view:
            * Tier 3 GS - fully grid capable, same as Tier 2 and same requirements
            * Tier 3 G - with a storage element (SRM or !GridFTP), no CE: OIM, GGUS and RT registration
      * depending on the Tier 3 there may be different requirements
            * OIM registration
            * GGUS registration (from OIM)
            * RT registration (independent from OSG)
            * Registration in TiersOfATLAS (independent from OSG)
            * Report metrics to WLCG
            * Be in the OSG BDII
            * Be in the WLCG BDII
            * Register the files in the central catalog (independent from OSG)
      * OSG should provide the capabilities, ATLAS will decide the requirements
      * The current selection of ATLAS sites to add in GGUS is inadequate
            * probably all and only the sites linked with USATLAS support center are selected
            * Kyle is investigating how GGUS is retrieving the list of ATLAS sites in OSG
            * proposal to change the procedure and make it explicit: e.g. add a checkbox selectable by the owner of the resource group
      * A Tier 3 (LBNL) is supporting multiple VOs (ATLAS, STAR and Alice) and set a different support center (NERSC). Because of this no GGUS ticket regarding this Tier 3 could be opened and a ticket was filed to change the registration. Changing the support center to USATLAS vould cause problems with the other VOs. This is an example for the need for an explicit option to register in GGUS
   * The upcoming Storage workshop 9/21-22 was mentioned as a place to continue storage discussions 

---+++ Follow-ups:
   * Ticket to remove meeting attendance requirement: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9165
      * the requirement had been removed already   
      * Elizabeth will update GOC documentation
