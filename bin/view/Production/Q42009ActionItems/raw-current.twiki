| # | Owner | Action/Significant Item | Open Date | Close Date |
|30|Abhishek, Dan| Meeting is being set up for next week to meet with SBGrid on scaling direction. | 12/1/09 |  |
|29|Britta, Brian| Slow data transfers at LIGO have been significantly improved | 12/1/09 |  |
|28|Britta, Brian| SRM problem at LIGO will require separate proxies for OSG and LIGO internal. Brian has send an update to Britta on how to make this work. | 12/1/09 |  |
|27|Xin, Burt| Problem of data being lost in BDII is under investigation. Burt to see if he can add the symptomatic Atlas sites to his ganglia metric query, or provide query code for Atlas to use. | 12/1/09 |  |
|26|Abhishek, John M| Need a list of anticipated requirements from the VOs and Engage | 11/24/09 |  |
|25|Abhishek, Dan| Need to schedule a meeting with SBGrid to understand future scaling requirements| 11/24/09 |  |
|24|Britta, Brian| Ongoing SRM problem at LIGO now identified as an RFC proxy and SRMCP incompatibility. What are next steps? | 11/24/09 |  |
|23|Xin, Armen, Burt| Need a list of open tickets impacting production from Atlas and CMS | 11/24/09 |  |
|22|Xin| T2 sites disappearing from CERN BDII, but still available in interop BDII | 11/24/09 |  |
|21|Britta, Brian| SRM still not working at LIGO, also the data transfer seems to be running slowly. Plan is to start an offline email dialogue to try and resolve this. | 11/17/09 |  |
|20|Brian, Burt, ... | CMS is making changes to CMS analysis s/w that should (over the next 2-6 months) improve cpu/wall clock efficiencies by changing ROOT file access patterns from random to sequential | 11/17/09 |  |
|19|  | Fermilab VO has implemented GIP configuration changes to advertise subcluster parameters e.g., memory, OS versions. Jobs submitted to FermiGrid? now match and go to the correct OS version | 11/3/09 |  |
|18|Britta, Tanya, Brian| LIGO still having problems with SRM. Work ongoing | 11/3/09 |  |
|17|Atlas| Atlas User Analysis post mortem scheduled for Nov 11 | 11/3/09 |  |
|16|  | CMS Physics Challenge post mortem did not identify any problems related to OSG | 10/27/09 |  |
|15|Suchandra| Gratia probe back in ITB | 10/27/09 |  |
|14|Burt| Physics challenge: Burt still digesting the post-mortem and will provide more details next week. In a nutshell, things went well, many jobs were run. There were issues (expected) in the arena of stage-out. | 10/27/09 |  |
|13|Xin| Atlas throughput testing has been postponed one week | 10/20/09 |  |
|12|Rob E, Todd, Jaime, Dan, Chander| LIGO production is down -- Condor team actively working with LIGO to solve the problem | 10/20/09 |  |
|11|Xin, Armen, Burt| CMS Physics challenge events and the Atlas throughput challenge events are being analyzed. Not sure if there will be any production issues | 10/13/09 |  |
|10|Alain| Mats sent out an email concerning the problem with left over Globus logs. Alain is planning to take this up with the Globus team. | 10/13/09 |  |
|9|Britta, Chander| LIGO has encountered a scaling problem in Condor (bug 19769) somewhere near the 10,000 queued jobs range. At the recommendation of Todd, they are currently planning to try the latest development version of Condor. | 10/13/09 |  |
|8|Rob| This weekend Oct 17 is the GOC move. Rob is making preparations to ensure a non-eventful transition | 10/13/09 |  |
|7|Rob| Preparations underway for the GOC machine room move on Oct 17 |10/6/09 |  |
|6|Abhishek, Dan| Need to invite more sites to host the NEBioGrid | 10/6/09 |  |
|5|Mats| Mats to send email regarding gram tmp cleanup | 10/6/09|  |
|4|Brian| RSV reporting has been corrected for BNL. | 10/6/09|  |
|3|Armen, Xin| Atlas conducting a throughput test Oct 5-8. Will identify if any production problems| 10/6/09 |  |
|2| Burt| CMS Physics challenge started on Oct 6. Burt to send messages if any production problems detected as a result of this.| 10/6/09 |  |
|1|Sarah| Make a separate action list in the Twiki | 9/22/09 | ongoing |
