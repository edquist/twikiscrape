-- Main.DanFraser - 05 Aug 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * CMS/ATLAS/LIGO all report smooth and stable production. 
   * In a joint Ops and Security Teams project, we have updated the CA Distribution to contain both old and new formats of the CAs. 

---++ Attendees:
   * Armen, Xin, Tony, Britta, Robert, Rob Q., Mine
 
---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 21478 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~363 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen &amp; Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC had very productive week. ATLAS got ~400pb-1 delivered, with total luminosity now for ATLAS 2.2fb-1. US ATLAS production was quite stable at the average level of about 12k running jobs up to Thursday. Then DB (DQ2) load issues with all clouds offline for a couple of hours. Job load is also down since then.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.7M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 90%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 822K managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 117K jobs per day
         * failed 53K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 553K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 250TB~400TB last week at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites
         * Work in progress to support GLOW VO, half of the USATLAS T1/T2 sites already support it.  
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : in progress

---++ OSG Operations (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/08/goc-service-update-tuesday-august-9th.html][ITB release]]
      * Cosmetic changes to OIM
   * Testing of new CA distributions completed
   * glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu is available
   * Investigation of the network outage at IUPUI continues. The highest level of University and vendor management are involved and an official statement will be made.
   * Gratia and !ReSS 
      * opensciencegrid.org listserv issues. 
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Found a misconfiguration at the GOC factory. All CMS jobs running on these glideins were failing. Applied an emergency patch. Now things seem to work.
      * UCSD had a building-wise power outage on Fri,  The factory went down for a few hours.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/08/goc-service-update-tuesday-august-9th.html][Release note]]
      * Cosmetic changes to OIM
      * Update frequency of display changed to 15 minutes (Reduces probability of alarm-generating timeouts)
      * Glide In  [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&amp;count_sg_1=on&amp;count_active=on&amp;count_enabled=on][status]] added to service monitor overview, enables scheduled alarms.
      * Changes to assignment logic in Ticket, added feature allowing users to see who else is viewing/editing a ticket.
   * New CA distributions will be released
   * Switch to !InCommon certificates for production services
   * Next week TWiki-docteam to move from Indianapolis to Bloomington (There are no twiki-itb instances in Indianapolis)
      * Practice run for moving TWiki and OIM later in August

---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * New CA distributions are released. Next week we will start moving experienced sites to new caches. We are ready to start this week but many sites are in TX. so we will wait until they come back. 
   * Work with ucsd on integrating cilogon ca has started. Met with ucsd folks and drew a plan for short term activities. Will set up a meeting within OSG to bring necessary people in the loop.  
   * OSG Summer workshop. 
   * Working with XSEDE users (Kim Dillman) to find a process to issue them certificates.
