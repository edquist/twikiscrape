Hello Facility Members
<p />
We have concluded <span class="twikiNewLink">EUGridPMA<a href="/bin/edit/Production/EUGridPMA?topicparent=Production.Jan26,2010ProductionMeeting" rel="nofollow" title="EUGridPMA (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> and I like to share my summary and action items with you. Overall, it was well worth the trip -- please see the items below. I am waiting for comments on some proposals. 
<p />
1. Terena CA that issues personal e-Science certs has been approved (with some minor conditional changes). Terena ca plans to use the commercial comodo CA as a backend CA, and as a front end use a  shib-like authentication portal The front end
has multiple federations and each country manages their own federations, each with different identity vetting rules.  In the end, terena CA serves the whole Europan NRENs. I see that having national
federations produce certs for the end users would eliminate the need for
having separate national CAs. if that happens, what would IGTF relevance
be? Another question is if national CAs are replaced by Terena CA and Terena CA has major  stakeholders other than grid communities, it may well veer off of IGTF policies, the grids. What would this mean for us. This is not an immediate issue. But I wonder if NRENs and Terena's prior business model is grid stakeholders or not. it seems not. 
Anyhow it opens up the path for CILogon CA to be accredited by IGTF.
<p />
2. Feth-crl problems from recent UCSD failures. The extra checks suggested by Frank W is agreed by David Groep, and David promised to put them into his next release. They are really very straightforward and main reason we ask David to do it is for future maintenance (I already implemented them)
<p />
2.1 The configuration flag for overwriting corrupted CRL files. Again as part of fetch-crl problem, we wanted to set a variable value differently by default. We will be able to do this as new fetch-crl version allows it. 
<p />
Action Item for Alain's attention: Upgrade to fetch-crl 2.7.0 which will allow us to set  this variable in the configuration file. we currently have 2.6.6. We must follow the next couple updates closely as they will solve new openssl version issue. 
<p />
3. CRL outages and RSV failures 
CRL lifetimes are set to a month and most CAs do not keep up with the updates on a timely basis. CAs are asked to update 7 days before the expiration date ; however, they usually do it on the last day or a bit late. RSV probes goes off a week before expiry. Result is a lot of warnings and failure messages to site admins. 
<p />
Based on the feedback at our identity workshop, I started keeping operational logs of outages per CA and showed at the meeting. I asked for increasing the lifetimes because CRL lifetime has zero affect on operational security. This was vehemently refused by David because he was afraid a longer period would even make updates more sporadic and less timely. 
<p />
Proposal: Let's get rid of the local RSV probe on CEs that gives warning and failure messages when a CRL near expiring. This probe is EXTRA , NOT required by WLCG. The required RSV probe checks whether site downloads CRL files or not; it does not check if downloaded files are expired or not. A site admin has absolutely no control over if a CA does not publish a new CRL and he has no reason to monitor this. It only makes them nervous. The security team already has a central probe that checks this directly against each CA and we send emails to IGTF when outages happen. When a user cannot authenticate due to a expired CRL, this shows up in gatekeeper log files so admin does not need a probe the situation.    
<p />
In addition, I will keep sending my logs of CA operational behavior to David and we are prepared to take out unbahaving CAs. 
Action Item for Alain's attention: remove RSV probe that checks the actual CRL expiry date from RSV bundle. 
<p />
3.2 Required WLCG RSV probe. This is different than the probe that I want to remove from the sites. Required WLCG probe checks the download time stamp of a CRL file and based on that time stamp grades a site. This probe is unfair in which if a CA is unavailable and download fails, the site gets a bad grade for lack of a timestamp. This probe is NOT critical in calculating a site's availability by WLCG. But nevertheless, it causes confusion and panic.
<p />
Proposal: Sites are required to try to download CRLs. So we should check whether they run fetch-crl periodically or not. We should not check if the downloads are successful or not. This means changing the probe logic from that of WLCG. 
WLCG may resist it.
<p />
Alternative proposal: Let's distribute CRLs from GOC just as we distribute the ca certs. GOC will run fetch crl to generate its CRL bundle, which they already do. Sites will only contact goc service to get the CRL files. This would cure all of the trouble without changing the code. Of course time outs and outages will happen , but at least sites will always succeed in downloading a CRL file and isolate from network problems. 
Downside: I have to edit IGTF distribution to encode GOC as an alternative crl location. Currently each CA has a file that tells where to get crl files. we have to edit these files or edit fetch-crl code.  
<p />
<p />
4. Robot certificates: Storing the private keys in secure Hardware tokens was a big discussion. I see this unnecessary and operationally hard for the certificate owners. We decided NOT to put this as the sole requirement and added "secure file system" in a secure room. This is sufficient imo. I do not think many people will achieve secure room requirement but I think it is OK. 
<p />
5. New openSSL version. Change in certificate file names, moves on from MD-5 to SHA-1. This breaks the interoperability with IGTF distribution which still uses MD-5 for naming. 
<p />
Proposals: IGTF keeps two distributions, one for old and one for the new openSSL. OR ask Debian and <span class="twikiNewLink">RedHat<a href="/bin/edit/Production/RedHat?topicparent=Production.Jan26,2010ProductionMeeting" rel="nofollow" title="RedHat (this topic does not yet exist; you can create it)">?</a></span> or Scientific Linux to include the IGTF bundle. 
Pros and cons in a separate email.

6. Risk assessment Team. This was chaired by Jim Basney in the past and this is built after OSG pressure during a PKI crises. 
Jens jensen chairs it, myself and Doug are members. I am disappointed that even basic ping tests with some CAs (20 out of 74) failed. They simply did not respond. 
<p />
Action Item: We cannot rely on CAs for any tolerable incident response. Sites must be well-enabled for fending for themselves in a crisis. We tested Tier 1 and Tier2 for basic capabilities in the drills. we must do a drill for Tier 3 and ensure they have latest tools. 
<p />
7. Certificate Lifecycle management tool. Dutch and UK CAs have separately developed two applications for managing certificate lifetimes over the desktop. This is a neat client side tool. Certificate management tools for end users is an action  item from our identity workshop meeting with our stakeholders. I proposed to form group across these projects and at the least develop common libraries for the management tools. The trend is each CA will develop their own management tool because their processes are slightly different from one another. But at the least they agreed to think through their differences and provide a common library for common behaviors, 
<p />
Action Item for security team: examine the tools, consider adoption in OSG or by DOEgrids CA. There are almost 4 tools. I tested only one of them so far. </div><!-- /patternTopic-->
