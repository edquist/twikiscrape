-- Main.DanFraser - 07 Jun 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * There is a problem with sites dropping out of the Sam-BDII at CERN. It is not known if this impacts other top-level BDIIs, but the problem scope is larger than just OSG as non-OSG sites are having the same problem. While the primary work on this is happening at CERN, Rob is planning to add the SAM-BDIIs to his monitoring system, and is also preparing to run a high intensity test against the SAM-BDIIs that we used earlier on known BDIIs. This should provide good comparison data that may be helpful in debugging.  (Rob)
   * Did not have representation from CMS this week. Dan to follow up with Burt on getting a replacement. (Burt, Dan)
   * The GIP team released an alpha version that will enable sites to register with just an SE. This is currently being tested by Atlas.

   * General production status
      * LHC decided to extend the commissioning for another week.Overall ATLAS production was very low. Still waiting for new samples. Ongoing validation of the new simulation. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 71%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 166k managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 24K jobs per day
         * failed 14K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 91%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 300~500TB/day.  
   * Issues
      * Opportunistic SE usage for D0 : site should be ready
      * automatic turnoff of FTS channels with high failure rate
      * SAM test issue --- sam bdii under investigation
      * Publish SE only info to BDII --- quick release of GIP from GIP group, CEMon still needs to be done.

         * We will run the same tests that we ran earlier this year against the SAM BDII instance and see if the results differ. (Previous issue and results can be seen [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7772][here]].)

---++ Engage (Mats, John)

12 users utilized 31 sites

7093 jobs total (5660 / 1433 = 79.8% success)

25335.0 wall clock hours total (20306.7 / 5028.3 = 80.2% success)

Still problems with users with broken workflows. Some days we have terrible success rates. Trying to educate users.


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Currently in ITB testing
      * Update is a java update to java 1.6
      * Should be ready for production release next week 

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.10
      *       77 (-2) OSG 1.2.X resources (       5 are 1.2.10)
      *        6 (1) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        6 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)


---+++ D0
   * Monte carlo production ongoing at good rate.
   * 9 M Evts/week. 115,000 hours/day at 87% efficiency.
   * Site related issues:
      * Low efficiencies at Purdue RCAC, !GridUNESP, SWT2, and Florida.

---+++ CDF
   * Restarting work on the production expansion plan to use more OSG sites opportunistically. 
   * Need additional packages on SL5 sites. Already deployed at Fermilab resources. 
      * Looking for an arrangement with large SL5 sites (ATLAS, CMS) to possibly verify/install these packages.
      * Burt/CMS has advised to use CMSSW installation model. CDF already has a similar model but still need to hardcode which libraries to probe for. Tedious due to the large list. Mine/OSG-Security has pointed out Pakiti&#39;s package query feature. Discussion ongoing.
   * Initial package list: 
&lt;verbatim&gt;
         tcl.i386 tcl-devel.x86_64 tcl-devel.i386 
         compat-libf2c.x86_64 compat-libf2c.i386 
         perl-Crypt-SSLeay lapack.i386 lapack.x86_64 
         libXp-devel.i386 libXpm-devel.i386 libXi-devel.i386 
         libXp-devel.x86_64 libXpm-devel.x86_64 libXi-devel.x86_64 perl-DBI 
         valgrind libstdc++-devel 
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

---+++ SBGrid
   * Continuing work with !GlideinWMS. 
   * Encountering scalability issues; looking into need for more RAM in submission infrastructure. 
   * More details in coming days.

---+++ GLUE-X
   * Facilitating D0&#39;s use of CE and SE at GLUE-X site UConn-OSG. 
   * Problems under investigation: 
      * Firewall/NAT likely blocking jobs when large groups of jobs are submitted together by a VO. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8579. Cause of problem was TCP keep alive configuration in network and firewall configuration. 
         * Resolved. Alain and Condor team are following up to include GLUE-X&#39;s suggestions in Condor.
      * D0 jobs blocked; SSL negotiation issue during socket setup. Cause of problem was a mix of older version of !GridFTP codebase, double-limited proxies, NFS-lite configuration. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8710. 
         * Resolved.
      
---+++ OSG-VO/CHARMM Group
   * Work ongoing is to expand CHARMM production from 3 sites to 23 sites.
      * Using !PanDA with active help from BNL team. 
      * !Panda server located at CERN; (submission infrastructure likely located at Wisconsin). 
         * Technical outages reported at both ends.
         * BNL !PanDa team is considering to move pilot submission subsystem (from Wisconsin) to BNL. 
         * Abhishek in discussions to understand the issue more clearly.
