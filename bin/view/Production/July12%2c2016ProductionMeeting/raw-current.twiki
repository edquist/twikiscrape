---++ Announcements:   

---++ Action/Significant Items: 
   * BNL has limited OSG VO to 2000. Jobs create large outbound network traffic saturating firewall. Some jobs were killed. Trying to research the problem. Stopgap measure of 2000 will probably be rolled back once the traffic subsides. Will create a ticket and then followup next week. https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/30570
   * Request notification to upgrade to most recent version of CVMFS Client (2.2.3) for FIFE support. Ticket will be created and linked at end of call. Ticket created at https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/30563
   * Kyle will contact Rob G for a !Xenon1T contact point for research highlight.
