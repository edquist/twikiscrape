---++ User Support (Chander, Bo)
   * Mats reported that we have had two queue (schedd) crashes on xd-login this week. Users have reported this as &quot;condor_q / condor_submit not working&quot;, and both time we have had to restart the schedd. He has collected logs and contacted the HTCondor team for help with debugging, and will let you know when we have more information.  At this point we are running with limits on number of active jobs allowed to stabilize the system.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies
      * No grid related vulnerabilities. but serious Firefox and Thunderbird vulnerabilities.
   * Operations. 
      * Kevin finished testing the SHA-2 intermediate CAs with user certs. Initially there was a problem. The CE could not authenticate to VOMS due to latest java security problems. CE was on SL5 and the VOMS was on SL6, which has the sslv3 turned off. once it is turned on, the authentication worked fine. Now, testing the host certs. We found no other problems so far. 
      * IGTF released a new CA last week. The new bundle is coming out next week. Syrian CA is out of the bundle. 
      * OSG CA project has its kick-off meeting yesterday.
