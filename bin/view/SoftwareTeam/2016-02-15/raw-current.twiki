*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

We are investigating a complicated issue with Gratia not sending certain valid grid-job records. It appears to occur with a combination of a non-HTCondor batch system and a mix of local and grid jobs. But, we are still not sure of the root cause(s) or way to improve the situation robustly. Ongoing.

For the March release, there are already 6 tickets that are ready for testing. But, there are 30 other active tickets, so there is plenty to do this week.

---+++ Support Update
   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Waiting on factory ops to verify that glideins are OK
   * Colorado (Marian) - Awaiting reponse about transfering SGE parameters into BLAHP ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2199][SOFTWARE-2199]])
   * FIU (!BrianL) - Thrashing on host may be due to missing host cert; Gratia issues in the hands of Gratia/Software team
   * Harvard (Marian) - intermix of LSF and SLURM config complicates submission to the HTCondor-CE, follow up via chat and email
   * MIT (!BrianL) - CDF pilots running but not reporting back. Waiting on response from Admin.
   * Northwestern (!BrianL) - Pilots were failing due to bad permissions on some certs/CRLs. Resolved.

---+++ Major Activities
   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])
   * Fix routine automated test failures ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1996][SW-1996]])
   * Documentation
   * [[SW024_ConsolidateRepos][Software repository consolidation]]
   * IPv6 evaluation ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1525][SW-1525]])
