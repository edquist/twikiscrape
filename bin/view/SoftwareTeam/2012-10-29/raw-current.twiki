---++ Issues

---+++ !jPackage Fire

Or at least, smoke. 

Recap of issue: jPackage upstream had hardware failures and lost all their RPMs.
Mirrors helpfully deleted all of their copies of the jPackage RPMs.
At the time of this writing, they have recovered.
However, we ought to become less dependent on them in case this happens in the future.

Here is the heart of Mat’s proposal:

   * The !jPackage !RPMs that we need to build other software with (and only those) will be added to the OSG SVN and upstream cache. They will be put into a separate area of SVN to avoid cluttering up the main repo. I suggest =$SVN/native/javadeps/{trunk,branches}=.
   * We will have an archive of !jPackage !RPMs/SRPMs that we do not use, in case we need to use them later. This archive will be backed up.
   * These RPMs will be built into separate Koji tags, not =el[56]-osg-development=. I suggest =el[56]-osg-javadeps=. I will attempt to make Koji policy to enforce this.
   * The =el[56]-osg-build= tags will inherit from these Koji tags, so we will be able to build using these packages. They will not go into =el[56]-osg-{development,testing,release,contrib}= since we do not want users to download these.

This is a lot of work, both to build them all, and to update them regularly. 
jPackage does not update very frequently, so merely keeping up with them might not be as much work.
Furthermore, this lets us control versions of Java software that we use.

In the past, ATLAS has asked us to provide something similar for EPEL, but that is considered a lot more complicated.
EPEL should be considered more reliable than jPackage, plus old versions of EPEL&#39;s packages are still available even after they update.

We will not be able to put deal with this until after the release, but we will proceed with this plan unless people have objections beforehand.
