*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

---+++ Support Update
   * Harvard (Mat/BrianL/Carl) - GIP was querying their Slurm DB as the =tomcat= user and this would bring down their cluster because the tomcat user didn&#39;t exist on the Slurm DB host. We should document this (in the install CE guide?).
   * Notre Dame (Mat/BrianL/Carl) - =empty-condor= conflicts with the release version of HTCondor-CE and had to be rebuilt.
   * UFL (!BrianL) - Found incompatability between blahp-1.18.26 (current release) and their torque-4.2.9. Jobs submitted with old proxy expiration time due to factory schedd failing to update the attribute on release. This is fixed in 8.5.x but there are still reliability questions about the expiration time in the job ad ([[Gittrac#5985][http://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5985]]).
   * IIT (!Derek) - Running multiple clusters behind a single HTCondor-CE-Bosco.  Both EL6 and EL7 clusters.  Required us to create a protocol between the factory, user support, and the site admins.


---++ OSG Release Team
