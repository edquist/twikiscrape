---++ Notes

*Release 3.1.16:* Tomorrow. Brian Lin will do release. Everything is basically ready, except still waiting to hear about last-minute changes to LSF. Includes:

   * Updates to vo-client
   * Updates to osg-ca-scripts
   * LSF jobmanager, jobmanager, osg-configure fixes to make LSF work
   * osg-ca-certs-updater - minor fix
   * New version of osg-pki-tools (we expect one more significant release of osg-pki-tools (1.2), then OSG Software will assume maintenance)

*Tarball Clients:* Internal (alpha) software testing last week; some bugs were found and fixed. New tarball will be made for 3.1.16; if nothing found by Wednesday, we will announce it as beta. If we can do that, we will be ahead of schedule. People might have =$OSG_LOCATION= left over from Pacman installs, so osg-post-install script should *not* look at it. Xin has problems with Fetch-CRL not downloading CRLs. Mat to take a look.

*Java Migration:* Good progess. Initial round of builds, followed by light testing and an initial round of fixes. Currently in a round of deeper testing (Carl and Neha). Hope to do a beta release in a week or two in osg-upcoming-testing. No feedback from sites yet, so we should explicitly contact a few, such as Steve Timm, SLAC, Terence Martin (UCSD).

*SLURM:* Suchandra is investigating bugs; he did not have much time to work on it last week, but will have more time this week.

*VOMS Client:* !BrianB made a patch for voms-proxy-init to make it use the same logic as grid-proxy-init for picking an algorithm for proxies. Suchandra can do internal testing, and then it definitely needs ITB testing (ask Steve and Xin for help). Suchandra wrote osg-test tests for this, but they have yet to be incorporated into Subversion and we would want to do so in a way that does not cause failures for the current production version of voms-proxy-init.

*HDFS 2:* This one was dropped when Doug left; need to pick someone to continue, possibly Mat (who got the brain dump from Doug).
