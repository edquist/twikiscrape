%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| February | 3.2.35 / 3.3.9 | 2016-01-25 | 2016-02-01 | 2016-02-09 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

We have 6 tickets for the February release, 3 for CVMFS (which was just tagged for final release), 2 for osg-test (which will be built today), and 1 for the late-arriving VO package update. All are being tracked closely and making good progress toward RFT.

---+++ Support Update
   * Caltech (Marian) - Awaiting response about upgrade
   * Clemson - Local scratch dir filled up (likely due to PBS doing a bad job of removing jobs) 
   * Colorado (Marian) - Awaiting reponse about transfering SGE parameters into BLAHP
   * FIU - Pilots only running for a few minutes, causing thrashing. Seems to be firewall issues, admin investigating; also, Gratia support issues (Carl)
   * Harvard (Marian) - intermix of LSF and SLURM config complicates submission to the HTCondor-CE, follow up via chat and email
   * MIT - Disabled all non-CMS VOs because the admin believed they were causing his CE&#39;s to thrash. Trying to re-enable CDF since they&#39;re part owners
   * OSC - Disabling the SEG fixed the issue for them, but that is not scalable; will contact Globus devs for when the upstream fix will become production
   * Vanderbilt - CE is missing various OSG_* attr since they&#39;re on an old version; trying to get them to update per Derek’s request

---+++ Major Activities
   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])
   * Fix routine automated test failures ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1996][SW-1996]])
   * Documentation
   * [[SW024_ConsolidateRepos][Software repository consolidation]]
   * IPv6 evaluation ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1525][SW-1525]])
