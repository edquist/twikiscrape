---+++ Discussion

---++ OSG Investigations Team
   * OASIS: Working toward a March release that has a number of small cleanups.  Particularly, we&#39;re moving away from the problematic NAS device and upgrading to CVMFS server 2.2.0.
   * Still figuring out internals of new Gratia v2.  Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]]
   * New &quot;secure CVMFS&quot; features have been submitted upstream.  Hope to have these in an May release of CVMFS 2.2.2.  Github Pull Request [[https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/pull/1497][#1497]]
   * HTCondor-CE-Bosco release is moving back to 3.3.12 due to errors with [[https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5601][Blahp&#39;s proxy handling]].  Tickets: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2187][2187]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2188][2188]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][2257]]
   * Gratia support for HTCondor-CE-Bosco is ongoing.  Gratia patch has been made ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][ticket]]), waiting on review from someone with commit access.  Also, will need to modify osg-configure for new gratia, which is ongoing.  Pull request [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-configure/pull/8][#8]]
