---++ The move from osg-development to osg-testing

We are about to move lots of software from osg-development to osg-testing, and then release our hordes of testers on it. On Friday afternoon, we got an update from Globus that is going in ASAP, though a couple of minor bumps happened during the Globus builds.  (Update: This happened on Monday evening).

---++ Next steps with CEMon

We have CEMon with a basic configuration, and it&#39;s configured to use the GIP. Doug hasn&#39;t tested with the GIP, though it *should* work. Parag had a test instance, and he had sent it there. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Documentation_Release3InstallCEMon][Initial documentation]] Tanya can look at output if someone else sets it up. GIP expects a single config.ini, not the new-style config.d direcotyr. Brian says the workaround is to steal the config.ini from somewhere else and use it. Alain will work with the GIP folks to get a real solution.

---++ Next steps with HDFS migration (!GridFTP modifications?)

We need to integrate the HDFS !GridFTP plugin with !GridFTP. It can&#39;t be like old CMS HDFS repo because we&#39;re using init instead of xinetd. Need to put hooks into init script to detect if DSI plugin is installed, then use it.  Jeff &amp; Doug&#39;s approach: One !GridFTP server, init script that sets environment variables &amp; configuration based on whats installed. Had to patch the sysconfig file. But Brian implemented a separate approach. We agreed to move forward with Jeff &amp; Doug&#39;s approach. We&#39;ll push suggestions to Globus on how to do this in general.

There are a few reamining tasks for the HDFS migration, particularly issues around packaging differences with the old CMS HDFS repo. Alain will email Igor to request that Jeff can continue doing this work. 

Jeff added hadoop-osg RPM, which is the OSG specific configuration.

---++ Individual status reports

   * *Alex*: Working on Bestman 2 that works with Java 7 &amp; updating libraries. Will still work with Java 6. Will drop modules that are not relevant to OSG or other users. 
   * *Brian*: Tracking new xrootd release. Xrootd 3.1 release candidate next week, release in mid-October. Working on simplifying installation and administration of glexec. (See his email regarding a new plugin.)
   * *Doug*: Got CEMon into the VDT &amp; worked on HDFS with Jeff. See above.
   * *Jeff*:  See HDF migration above.
   * *Marco*: Did some CE smoke testing: found problems, mostly okay. RSV probes for cacerts-expiry: should be ready by the end of the day. 
   * *Mat*: See Globus 5.2 above. Now have vdt.cs.wisc.edu repo mirror set up. Did smoke testing in Globus 5.2, reported problems to Globus Team. Fixed problems with signing of RPMs. Currently building Globus 5.2 updates. 
   * *Scot*: Lots of progress on RSV, nearly ready for wider testing.
   * *Tanya*: Great vacation. Last week on Software Team. What should she do? Cemon help. Xrootd transfer probe is ready, so Tanya will do testing of Xrootd &amp; storage probes.
   * *Tim*: Last week wrote new tests for !GridFTP. Going really well, have a bit to finish up. Will release new package and turn it over to Marco while he works on the LIGO packaging.

---++ RPM/yum question from Tim
Sometimes when Tim does an RPM install, he gets the 64-bit version (including dependencies), while sometimes he gets 32- and 64-bit versions? Doug has the same question. 

Brian says this is the magic of the &quot;Red Hat multi-arch algorithm&quot; that automatically decides when to grab the 32-bit libraries. If the user explicitly requests a package that contains shared libraries, you get 32- and 64-bit versions. In all other cases, you get 64-bit. 

yum configuration to restrict set of packages: in yum.conf &quot;multilib_policy&quot;. 

---++ Miscellaneous
Doug will be gone September 29 through October 7. In Cancun!!
