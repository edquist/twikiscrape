*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Short of Brian today - traveling to the OSG Review (including a UNL department retreat, will only be around on).
   * Starting to individually contact the last USLHC sites without a HTCondor-CE deployed.  Biggest outstanding issue remains WLCG SAM tests (external application).
   * We were able to get networking data uploaded to GOC and start to appear in monitoring dashboards.
   * Making progress on putting together 200k running job scale tests (UNL sleeper pool now available).  Will re-evaluate plans with Igor.
