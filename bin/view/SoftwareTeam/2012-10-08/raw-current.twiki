---+ OSG Software Team Meeting, 8 October 2012

*Attending:* Igor, Marco, Matyas, Neha, Suchandra, Tim, Xin

---++ Announcements

*Triage Duty:* Tim this week, Doug next week; 9 open tickets.

*OSG Deployments:* OSG 3.x: 53 (+8) last week; 10 using 3.1.9; OSG 1.2: 53 (–1) sites, 1 using 1.2.30.

Meeting format note: We will try to spend less time on reviewing accomplishments and next actions, because they are in the notes.

---++ Accomplishments

   * Prepared updates for release this week: CA certificates (IGTF 1.50), graphtool, javascriptrrd, osg-build, and mash.
   * Determined that GUMS 1.3.18 works with SHA-2 certificates!
   * Had a very useful conference call about the state and future of GUMS.
   * Packaged osg-pki-tools again; it is being tested further this week during Digicert training.
   * Patched LSF jobmanager with xcount option to support HTPC — waiting for test results from Horst et al.
   * Patched Condor jobmanager to fix behavior of accounting groups (per Burt Holzman).
   * Upgraded to !XRootD 3.2.5 (in osg-testing).

---++ Issues

   * Release 3.1.10: Suchandra will do this release; would like to get all team members to do one eventually
   * SHA-2 testing: Winding down, still investigating !XRootD and !BeStMan/jGlobus.
   * VOMS: Would like to ship update soon, needs lots of testing
   * CA certificate updater: Dan wants this soon — production within 2 months, max
   * GUMS: Lots of small issues, which we will start addressing as possible.
   * Texas Tech (Alan Sill)?
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure.

---++ Actions

   * Test latest !BeStMan and !jGlobus combination (Neha)
   * Integrate !BeStMan and !jGlobus patches and possibly pushing upstream (Neha, Brian)
   * Test !XRootD + GSI + SHA-2 (Suchandra)
   * Test latest VOMS and VOMS Admin (Mat)
   * Test VOMS upgrade documentation (Xin)
   * Start a concrete design for a CA certificate updater system (Tim, Mat)
   * Document and triage GUMS tasks (Tim)
   * Work on GUMS documentation (Suchandra)
   * Test GUMS 1.3.18.009-6 (Suchandra)
   * Help Alan Sill and other TTU folks as needed (Suchandra)
   * Finish new HDFS test (Doug)
   * Design next step for testing infrastructure (Tim, Mat)

---++ Notes

   * *SHA-2:* Suchandra reported that !XRootD + GSI + SHA-2 seems to be working fine. Apparently the =osg-test= tests were bad, not the component itself; Suchandra will commit fixes to the tests. Neha is still investigating !BeStMan and !jGlobus; she set up a !BeStMan 2 server on el6, but with a lot of manual work. Not to be overly competitive with our European colleagues, but we do seem to be ahead of EMI with SHA-2 testing, or at least reporting about it. Neha noted that !FermiGrid is doing SHA-2 testing independently; the link to their results matrix will be posted on our [[Sha2Support][SHA-2 page]]. Finally, despite all the good (but relatively shallow) testing that we are doing, ultimately, we need to get upstream developers to certify their own software for SHA-2 functionality, since we have neither the time nor expertise to do in-depth testing.

   * *VOMS:* Mat build the latest versions of VOMS and VOMS Admin a while ago, and they are in osg-testing. In addition to our automated tests, Mat is doing manual tests, including of interoperability with current shipping versions. At the same time, Xin is testing the VOMS upgrade process from an OSG 1.2 install, based on documents updated by Marco and Tanya. We would like to complete this testing within 2 weeks, so that we can build the next release around it.

   * *CA certificate updater:* Our existing scripts for automated updates of CA certificates do not work with the default case of a simple yum install of CA certificates. Site administrators want an equivalent automated solution for CA certificates installed the normal way. We need a production solution prior to the next CA certificate update, ideally within about a month. Mat and Anand will be looking into this.

   * *Texas Tech:* They have not responded to Suchandra’s emails, so he will continue to ping them.

   * *Testing:* We need more tests and a better test infrastructure; this has been on the back burner for months, but should be brought forward now. People interested in coding should talk to Tim so he can assign work relating to it. Mat is planning to help out.
