%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.22 | 2013-07-29 | 2013-08-05 | 2013-08-13 | dcache-srmclient, RSV, many bug fixes, CVMFS? |
| 3.1.23 | 2013-08-26 | 2013-09-03 &lt;span style=&quot;color: red; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; | 2013-09-10 | |
| 3.1.24 | 2013-09-23 | 2013-09-30 | 2013-10-08 | |
*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Wrote, tested (internally), and packaged a workaround in Gratia for the unreasonably large !RemoteSysCpu numbers from HTCondor
   * Finished and reviewed a new RSV probe to report on installed Java implementations
   * Packaged a medium-sized set of RSV changes
   * Found (crashing) bug with the latest version of lcg-util
   * Packaged and promoted osg-ca-scripts changes
   * Packaged and promoted a small improvement to the osg-gums metapackage
   * Made the !BeStMan tests in osg-test more robust
   * Extended an osg-test library function so that it can check for virtual dependencies
   * Figured out and documented how to instantiate a simple CVMFS repository for automated testing
   * Helped Srini (contractor at Fermi) finalize his Gratia probe tests
   * Packaged and promoted osg-test changes
   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * New RSV release (Carl and Mat): standard 4, osg-testing, mark tickets as Ready For Testing
   * Gratia HTCondor workaround (Suchandra): test and promote today?
   * SLURM support (Suchandra): retest on both PBS and SLURM systems, [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-749 SW-749]] done today?
   * OSG Software 3.2 project: refine project definition this week (!TimC)
   * OSG WN client in OASIS: Mat will do initial install and documentation this week
   * osg-test improvements (!BrianL): Design and start adding configuration file
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC (!TimC): push Oz functionality to simplify VM run-time needs

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): ???
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL): work on 8.0.1

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates? (waiting for patches to be moved upstream, then subsequent release)
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes

*SLURM:* John Thiltges tested SLURM RPMs at UNL for a week and found no issues. RPMs already have the latest patches. The Gratia probe is in production already, so maybe it just needs a little final testing. The GIP changes may also be ready, but !TimC will check with Burt. Other than that, the SLURM-specific changes to the CE documentation need to be reviewed, and that should be about it. Maybe SLURM will ship this time.

*osg-test:* Srini, a contractor for Tanya at Fermi, has been working on Gratia probe tests for a while. They are just about ready to be merged into the SVN trunk and hence run nightly. At first, we will run without installing Gratia, to make sure that the new tests do not affect the existing ones. Then, the relevant Gratia packages will be added to =osg-tested-internal=. This first phase of tests works on prepared log files that are included with the tests. The next phase will be to add tests that actually use the relevant services (e.g., HTCondor), then process their log files dynamically.

!BrianL is going to continue osg-test improvements by adding the capability to use a configuration file to define a test run; this feature will be needed for VM universe-based tests. !TimC got Oz to build a base SL6 image that boots and runs ssh successfully on the osghost system. In related news, HTCondor 8.0.1 has a serious bug with VM universe, but will likely get fixed by 8.0.2.

*HTCondor in Debian:* !BrianL is still stuck with an HTCondor build error. So far, no one in FW knows what causes it. Brian will check in with Michael Hanke, too.


---++ OSG Release Team

Today is the testing freeze for 3.1.22.  Think of this one as soft serve ice cream.  At this point, I would like to know about all tickets that are intended to go into 3.1.22.  In JIRA terms, be sure they are labeled 3.1.22.  If possible, they should be marked ready for testing.  This is to ensure that we can plan for the testing.  Please have tickets marked by the end of the day.

When marking tickets &quot;Ready for Testing&quot;, please also mark them &quot;Unassigned&quot;.

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released [[InstallSoftwareWithOpenJDK7][Installing OSG Software to Use OpenJDK 7]]
   * CVMFS 2.1.12 tested (it is enough testing?)

---+++ Projects

   * Working on 3.1.22 (31 tickets targeted, 2 Ready for Release, 23 Ready for Testing, 6 In Progress)
   * Testing many tickets
   * Plan to release [[InstallOsgUpcomingSoftware][OSG Upcoming Software Repositories Installation Guide]]
   * Will add one more ticket for update VO data.

   * Document testing expertise on wiki as well as ITB site capabilities.

---+++ Notes

*JIRA Tickets:* !BrianL may be able to mark tickets &quot;Unassigned&quot; automatically on transition to &quot;Ready for Testing&quot;.

*CVMFS 2.1.12 Testing:* Xin&#39;s testing of CVMFS is adequate. !BrianB noted that the code has already been tested well by the EGI folks.  Also, it is late minor release in a stable package.

*RSV Updates:* RSV should be tested by anyone running a CE or an SE. Neha should be able to test SE; Suchandra should be able to test CE and SE. Neha will ask Steve Timm if FNAL might have an ITB instance we could use for testing. RSV probes for ITB instances send data to the GOC, same as for production instances.

*OpenJDK 7:* Will formally announce deployment plan for Java 7.

*Testing expertise:* !TimT putting together a testing expertise and ITB site capability wiki page. Please send him your testing experience list.

*dCache-SRMClient:* Neha having trouble with dCache-SRMClient. Should talk to Mat -- very high priority.
