---++ Proposed changes in OSG 1.2.11

This is the list of changes we propose to have in OSG 1.2.11. (That is, these are the differences from OSG 1.2.10.) We plan to begin testing OSG 1.2.11 the week of June 14th.

The only change in this release will be that the default Java in the VDT will be changed from Java 1.5 to Java 1.6.  This is because Java 1.5 is no longer being supported by Sun, and security updates will no longer be available to us. This change will affect the following components:
   * Tomcat webapps:
      * CEMon-Server
      * GUMS
      * VOMS-Admin
      * VOMRS
      * Gratia-Reporting
   * Client tools
      * GUMS-Client
      * Pegasus
      * VOMRS-Client
      * SRM-Client-Fermi
      * SRM-Client-LBNL (note: Bestman is already using Java 1.6)
      * SRM-Tester-LBNL
      * OSG-Discovery
   * Services:
      * Condor
      * !MonaLisa
      * OSG-Match-Maker
   * Other packages:
      * Ant
      * Verify-GIP-For-CEMon

---++ Compatibility testing
Clearly, updating Java to 1.6 affects a lot of our components. We have already done extensive testing in the VDT&#39;s internal testbed, both automated and manual. So far, we have seen no evidence of any problems due to the upgrade.

One software package, Bestman, was already using Java 1.6, and a few sites have manually upgraded to Java 1.6 with no problems. Therefore we feel confident that this is likely to be a safe upgrade.

---++ Schedule
We hope to begin testing the week of June 14th, 2010. Release depends on ITB testing speed, but hopefully two to three weeks after testing begins, or late June.
