*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * Still supporting Utah, though that seems to be winding down.
   * !StashCache now has a real science use case, and has been working well for them.
