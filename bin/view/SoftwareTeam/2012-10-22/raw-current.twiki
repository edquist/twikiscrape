Tim starts teaching for the rest of the semester.
Because of that, the OSG Software Team Meeting is rescheduled for Mondays at 11 a.m. for the duration of the semester (at least).
Software Team members should send in their weekly reports at the end of the day Friday, or as soon as possible on Monday morning, so that Tim has time to draft the meeting notes page ahead of time.

   * Condor name change (pending)

---++ Actions

   * Test latest !BeStMan and !jGlobus combination (Neha)
   * !BeStMan and !jGlobus: Wrap up packaging tasks, etc. (Neha, Brian, more?)
   * !XRootD: Update plugins for 3.3 and retest (Doug, Brian)
   * Test osg-ca-certs-updater (Mat, others?)
   * Test VOMS upgrade to testing version and update documentation (Xin, Mat, Marco)
   * Write new VOMS Admin automated tests (Mat)
   * Look into GUMS library improvements (Doug)
   * Identify other easy GUMS improvements (Tim, Brian)
   * Work on GUMS documentation (Suchandra)
   * Test GUMS 1.3.18.009-6 (Suchandra)
   * Finish new HDFS test (Doug)
   * Design next step for testing infrastructure (Tim, Mat)
   * Help Alan Sill and other TTU folks as needed (Suchandra)
   * Write a more explicit proposal for dealing with the LCMAPS packaging changes (Tim)
   * Have ITB test VOMS upgrade (Suchandra)
   * Certain sites have had trouble with updating to OSG 3.x due to stricter checks in osg-configure. Need more background information. (Suchandra?)

---++ Notes

   * Suchandra pointed out that 3 (or so) GOC tickets are in the “can we close this ticket now” phase, so that is good.

   * Fermilab is experiencing internal networking problems this morning. This is delaying some work based there and affects all !FermiCloud users.

   * !XRootD still does not support GSI authentication on el6 due to the !OpenSSL version differences between EL5 and EL6. Doug is working with upstream to get these resolved, but we do not expect anything in the immediate future.

   * Suchandra checking with John Weigand and Steve Timm if they have sites he could use for testing. Xin will do another update test from OSG 1.2 to OSG 3.x with the new VOMS. We would like to get this done by Wednesday so we can decide if we want to include it in the release.
