---+ Switching Software Area (/software) to Git

---++ Objectives

   * The OSG (or CHTC) must own and fully manage the operations of the authoritative Git repositories
   * We must have dependable backups of the repositories
   * There should be public mirrors of our repositories (on !GitHub) that are kept up to date
   * Anyone should be able to read the repositories or their public copies (e.g., !GitHub), including histories
   * Anyone should be able to submit a contribution
   * The OSG Technology team must have sole write privileges on the authoritative repositories
   * Team members must be able to easily review and approve submitted contributions
   * The workflows for both contributors and team members must be clearly documented.\
     Common use cases should be efficient and easy to learn
   * The migration process must preserve existing data, should interrupt work little, and should be reversible

---++ Architecture

---+++ Location of/Access to the Authoritative Repos

The authoritative repos will be on the UW&#39;s AFS. We&#39;ll use the UW CSL&#39;s kerberos authentication.
External team members will clone their repos over SSH to some machine they have access to (e.g. =library=).
This was the chosen architecture.

*Advantages*
   * No additional auths to set up -- all team members already have all the privileges they would need to use this
   * Volumes will be backed up as-is (though care must be taken to ensure consistency)
   * Not dependent on a single machine (any machine with AFS access is good)
   * Precedent: HTCondor team does this

*Disadvantages*
   * Need to ensure backup/mirroring cronjobs have AFS tokens
   * Management divided between OSG Software and CSL

---+++ Public (!GitHub) Mirror
In order to facilitate contributions from external collaborators, we will
create one !GitHub repo for each authoritative repo. The !GitHub repos will be
owned by the &quot;opensciencegrid&quot; organization. Team members will need to have
!GitHub accounts and be members of the organization in order to approve
contributions.

We will have a dedicated !GitHub account for doing automated pushes to !GitHub.
We&#39;ll have a cron job that mirrors periodically, as well as a &quot;post-receive&quot;
hook for each repo that does a push to !GitHub after every push it receives.

---+++ Backups

Regardless of the other parts of the architecture, a rolling backup system like
what we do for the SVN repos would be a good idea.

Here&#39;s a simple outline. For each repository:
   1. Lock the repo (probably via an &quot;update&quot; hook that does exit 1)
   1. Wait for git-receive-pack processes to exit
   1. Rsync to copy the repo (preferably to AFS)
   1. Unlock the repo (remove the hook)
   1. Delete the oldest backups until we have &amp;lt;=10

---++ Contributions

External collaborators can fork or clone our !GitHub mirror and send pull
requests. A team member can examine the pull request, download it as a patch,
then apply it to their own repo, and push the commit(s) to the real repos.

Shouldn&#39;t take too long -- !GitHub provides copy-and-paste instructions, though
they will have to be slightly modified since they are providing instructions on
how to apply the change to the !GitHub repo, not your own.

---++ Migration

---+++ One-time Setup

   1. Set up a git server
   1. Create an authors file to map SVN user names to email addresses for Git (there is one at &quot;/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/svn-access/authors.txt&quot;)
   1. Create a backup cronjob that reads a list of repositories to back up; should be run by cndrutil user if we care about AFS
   1. Create a !GitHub user that will be used for auto uploads; create a passwordless ssh key for it and store it somewhere safe; also store the !GitHub password for the user somewhere safe
   1. Create a mirror cronjob that reads a list of repositories and mirrors them all to github using the user from the previous step
   1. Create or obtain replacement for our SVN post-commit email hook.\
      [[http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/contrib/hooks/multimail/git_multimail.py?id=HEAD][Git-Multimail]], which was made by the Git developers, should be fine for this.

---+++ Per-project Migration

   1. Schedule a switchover date with the owner
   1. Use subgit import to convert the repository (it&#39;s a lot nicer than git-svn)
   1. Add info about the repo to the gitolite config file (if using gitolite)
   1. Set up git hooks (copy them from another converted repository, or we may have a template)
   1. Update the backup cronjob
   1. Test the repo
      1. Test viewing via web interface
      1. Test making changes (you should test this, and then the owner should as well)
         1. Clone the repo
         1. Make a branch
         1. Make a change, commit it to the branch
         1. Push the branch
      1. View the logs for the git repo, make sure they match the logs of the SVN repo
      1. If anything fails, either debug, _carefully recording all steps_ or just nuke the git repo and try again
   1. Make a file in the trunk of the SVN dir called =MOVED-TO-GIT= that contains the following text:&lt;pre&gt;
The source code for this project is now contained in a Git repository located at:
&lt;b&gt;repo url&lt;/b&gt;
Changes committed to SVN will be ignored.&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. svn lock the project in SVN

---+++ Per-Project Mirroring to !GitHub

   1. Create an opensciencegrid/&lt;em&gt;PROJECT&lt;/em&gt; github repo
   1. In the local (authoritative) git repo, do &lt;code&gt;git remote add --mirror github git@github.com:opensciencegrid/&lt;em&gt;PROJECT&lt;/em&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;
   1. Add the repo to the list of repositories managed by the mirror cronjob
   1. Add a &quot;post-receive&quot; hook to the local repo to push to github -- might be as simple as &lt;pre&gt;
exec git push --quiet github &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Notes

We will not have information on full project renames (since each project dir will become a separate repo).

We need to keep the old SVN repo around to get the full history.
(The old repo will be locked to prevent further commits).

We may wish to omit dead projects or old names of renamed projects (vdt-build for example).

---+++ Alternate Architecture Options
These were the proposed alternatives to having the Git repos hosted on
the UW&#39;s AFS.

---++++ CHTC-controlled Git server (git.chtc.wisc.edu)
Server managed by the CHTC infrastructure team in Madison.
Access via Gitolite. All team members will clone their repos over SSH to the
Git server using an SSH public/private key pair.

*Advantages*
   * Git server is already set up, just need to add new repositories and public keys
   * Web interface also already set up
   * Precedent: CHTC infrastructure team does this

*Disadvantages*
   * OSG Software team has no login access to that machine
   * Dependent on a single machine
   * CHTC infrastructure team already overloaded

---++++ OSG Software-controlled Git server (perhaps on osghost.chtc.wisc.edu?)
Access via Gitolite. Users will need to use public keys and SSH.

*Advantages*
   * Full control over software, users, cronjobs, daemons, backups, everything

*Disadvantages*
   * Full responsibility for software, users, cronjobs, daemons, backups, everything
   * Dependent on a single machine
   * Nothing set up
