---++ State of support

| &lt;b&gt;On triage duty this week:&lt;/b&gt; | Doug |
| &lt;b&gt;On triage duty next week:&lt;/b&gt; | Mat |
| &lt;b&gt;Open tickets:&lt;/b&gt; | 12 |

Four of our new tickets from last week are VOMS problems from Dan Yocum. They are  serious problems when combined: Fermilab is thinking of downgrading to the old VOMS. Alain is working with Dan and the VOMS developer (Andrea) to deal with these.

---++  Followup from Test Fest

Our goal is to release an updated osg-test that incorporates the new tests that people are working on. Towards that end, people reported on the tests they started last week.

   * Scot: Have a lot of RSV tests. Extending the common library. Would like to get a couple more tests in, but his existing tests work well on their own.
   * Suchandra. integrating osg-configure unit tests. Have figured out how to incorporate them. Needs to extend osg-configure RPM to package the unit tests. Will cut new osg-configure release tomorrow. These tests can be done soon, certainly this week. Working on Torque, but waiting to get access to FermiCloud, so they might take longer to do. 
   * Doug: Have two Xrootd tests to copy files and one to use FUSE. They work fine and can go into a release. 
   * Neha: Working on Bestman tests. The tests can bring Bestman up and down, but she&#39;s having problems with VOMS (needed to get a VOMS proxy). Alain will help debug. 
   * Maxim: Working on testing GUMS. So far, no success. Got stuck configuring GUMS. John helped a bit and he&#39;s volunteering to write the tests for GUMS. This is great! Maxim will help John get up to speed on the test suite. Alain will help him get access to OSG Software resources. 
   * Alain: Worked on a test of Condor using glexec to authenticate/authorize individual jobs. He ran into three bugs (two in Condor and one in our packaging) which he had to fix or workaround. The test itself is now working but has a problem in cleaning shutting down Condor, so he&#39;s working on resolving that. 

---++ Planning details of OSG Software 3.1
We agreed on the desired content for OSG Software 3.1
   * Scientific Linux 6 support for the CE, SE and VOMS 
   * GUMS
   * Gratia service
   * Globus bug fixes (GRAM-329)
   * glexec/lcmaps update
   * GIP 1.3.6
   * Xrootd 3.2.0 (?)
   * RSV (fixed bugs filed by Horst)
   * osg-configure updates (comment out things in the defult 30-gip.ini, not giving errors about RSV when not installed)

Doug notes that the SE, depends on gums-client, which doesn&#39;t yet exist on SL6. Mat and John are working on the problems building GUMS on SL6. 

Alain is worried about getting sufficient testing for this release by the desired April 17th date, so we&#39;re shooting for April 24th instead. People are comfortable that this is soon enough without being too soon. 

Suchandra will be on vacation April 14-29, so we really need to kick off the testing ASAP even if we slow the release date. 

Brian reported that glexec has been accidentally installed at a few worker nodes at Nebraska, and it seems mostly okay. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: Test fest last week. Working on Xrootd 3.2 release candidate is now in testing. Have rebuilt Xrootd sub-packages (lcmaps, etc.) Have also expanded documentation no those packages. Next will work on building osg-discovery on SL6. 
   * *Marco*: Worked on documentation for how to migrate CE from OSG 1.2 to 3.0
   * *Maxim*: See GUMS testing above.
   * *Neha*: Test fest last week. Have been working on Xrootd-lcmaps documentation. 
   * *Scot*: Test fest (see RSV above)
   * *Suchandra*: Test fest (see above). Working on Glideinwms VO Frond End for the ITB. Also working on getting ATLAS pilots running. Also working on osg-configure bugs
   * *Terrence*: GUMS testing is in progress. With logging to /var/log/messages, it runs about 33% as fast at it should. Brian was confused because he says his version doesn&#39;t put anything into /var/log/messages. Perhaps this is lcmaps doing the logging? Not clear. Brian will followup with Terrence to understand better. There may be an issue with needing to make /var/log/messages asynchronous.
