*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

Starting with the March release, the presumption is that packages will be released on OSG 3.3 only, except in the case of critical fixes (and known things like VO client updates, certificates updates, etc.). Note possible exceptions in tickets and !TimC or !TimT will check with Rob Quick as needed.
