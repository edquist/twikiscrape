*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
   * HTCondor 8.4.2 most likely coming tomorrow, be ready for builds, developer testing, etc. – ask for help if appropriate.
   * There is a new internal tool at =&lt;em&gt;SVN&lt;/em&gt;/software/tools/built-against-pkgs=. It extracts NVRs of given package names that were installed as part of given builds. !TimC will ask for this information before approving promotions to testing in certain cases where it seems important. For instance, we sometimes need to verify that HTCondor-CE was built against a particular version of HTCondor itself, and this tool makes it very easy to answer the question. It even produces output in JIRA format! Try using the tool from a machine that has Koji access set up.
   * Last week’s release may have introduced a problem with the logrotate entries for the RSV JSON consumer – we should investigate immediately to see if this is fixable for Thursday. [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/27417][GOC #27417]].
