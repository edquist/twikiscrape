*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
Nothing in particular.

---+++ Support Update

   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - Investigated gratia-probe-metric CE history errors: they&#39;re &quot;expected&quot; so we should drop the history parsing from the metric probe.
   * Central collector (!BrianL/Derek/BrianB) - There are issues with collector2. collector1 is now solely serving collector.opensciencegrid.org
   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Jobs getting held, seemingly because there&#39;s too much load on the PBS Pro scheduler. Site is throttling our jobs so I&#39;ve asked factory ops to do the same. Maybe need to tinker with =GRIDMANAGER_JOB_PROBE_RATE= and/or =GRIDMANAGER_JOB_PROBE_INTERVAL=?
   * Utah (!DerekW) - Seems to be working.  Currently have 2 clusters configured.
   * UERJ (!BrianL) - Successfully submitting jobs, waiting for verification by ITB factory

     opened a ticket for testing their packaging, and writing a wrapper for Condor jobs to use

---+++ Last Week

   * !StashCache: Intermittent failures at UCSD.  Not necessarily because of StashCache.  Cache machine is on a shared host with other services that broke StashCache.
   * Ongoing developent of =stashcp= by !UChicago - great progress on that.
   * GRACC development has been moving forward.  Tanya&#39;s reports (the nice HTML ones) are being converted over to use GRACC.

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.  Still ongoing!
