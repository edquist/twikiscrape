%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.30 / 3.2.4 | 2014-01-27 | 2014-02-03 | 2014-02-11 | |
| 3.1.31 / 3.2.5 | 2014-02-24 | 2014-03-03 | 2014-03-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

   * Promoted the !GridFTP-HDFS package from Globus into testing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1214][SW-1214]])
   * Fixed several small-to-medium Gratia probe issues ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-111][GR-111]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-120][GR-120]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-126][GR-126]])
   * Finished preparations for dropping !GridSite from OSG in favor of the EPEL package ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1348][SW-1348]])
   * Verified that nightly backups of the Koji infrastructure can be used to recover the system
   * Documented an internal tool for helping with VO package updates ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1274][SW-1274]])
   * Found an extra machine (the old osg-edu) for the Madison ITB site
   * Fixed a few minor issues with osg-test and the VMU test reporting ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1325][SW-1325]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1363][SW-1363]])
   * Built osg-test 1.4.7 and promoted it to testing
   * Removed !OpenSSL 1.0.0 from the Koji build repository, so that builds that require packages that require !OpenSSL 1.0.1 succeed

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: still debugging and testing (Suchandra)
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: define project (!TimC), implement Koji backups (Mat)
   * Automated testing: Write initial HTCondor-CE tests (!BrianL), start design document for osg-test 2.0 (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * Support US-CMS in Koji (SOFTWARE-1095): Need to contact Tony Tiradani for status (Mat)
   * UW ITB site: waiting for Infrastructure team to rebuild machines, check machine setup, pick configuration manager, start assigning installs to team members (Mat, !TimC)
   * Document our documentation needs (!TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)

---+++ Notes

*GOC tickets:* When working on a ticket, please change the NAD (Next Action Deadline) field to a reasonable amount of time into the future (but no more than a week or so). The list of tickets colors due and not-yet-due tickets differently, so having good NADs is helpful in scanning tickets for ones that have not been touched in a while. Also, there is no formal policy for closing tickets that seem to be abandoned by the originating user, in part because we use our existing knowledge of users, sites, etc., to decide how long to wait. But we do eventually close out stale tickets. When it doubt, ask Tim C.

*HTCondor-CE and PBS:* !BrianB asked that we try to solve the HTCondor-CE/PBS problems using the shared filesystem approach, instead of using scp for input and output files. Suchandra will return to that configuration and try to figure out why it did not work before. Whatever is discovered will have to be documented clearly.

*ITB site:* In thinking about a configuration management tool, Suchandra offered to share Puppet scripts from his site, and !BrianB said that nearly all CMS sites use Puppet (except Wisconsin, which uses Chef). Unless there are objections soon, we will go with Puppet. Everyone on the teams will need to learn the basics of Puppet, because everyone will be involved in installation, configuration, and maintenance of the site.
