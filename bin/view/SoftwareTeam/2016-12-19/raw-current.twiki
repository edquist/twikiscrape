*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
None this week, other than the aforementioned holiday schedules.

---+++ Support Update

   * Georgia Tech (Carl/BrianL) - Gratia&#39;s CVMFS check is hanging. They also plan on adding more nodes to their pool and need assistance.
   * IIT (!BrianL/Marty) - Investigating glideins landing on the incorrect OS (i.e. EL6 when EL7 is requested). Factory Ops does not have route information easily available so it&#39;s difficult to troubleshoot routes from their end. It was suggested that the =!RouteName= be added to the glidein ad but this would be incomplete since job routes are susceptible to change, especially during troubleshooting. Perhaps the routing table could be stored as well.
   * Wisconsin (!BrianL) - Spoke with Gonzalo to get !IceCube submit nodes updated after the New Year. Asked Dan Bradley about updating to the latest gratia-probe to test it for us.
   * UFL (!BrianL) - SAM tests failing due to inability to send sandbox, sounds like it&#39;s getting removed out from under HTCondor-CE


---++ OSG Release Team
   * January 10th Release - OSG 3.3.20

---+++ Last Week

   * USATLAS looking at AGIS compatibility layer for the collector.  New HTCondor-CE-View has been deployed on ITB collector.  They are happy so far with osg-configure and the json output from HTCondor-CE-View.  Should be put on production in Dec. change over.
