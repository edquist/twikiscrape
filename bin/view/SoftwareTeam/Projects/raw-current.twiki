---+ Current Projects for the Software Team

This page lists OSG Software team projects. The criteria for declaring an effort to be a project are subjective and fuzzy, but generally involve one or more of the following aspects:

   * Longer or more complex than is easily tracked in a single JIRA ticket
   * Having significant affect on several functional areas (e.g., Operations, Production, Security)
   * Needing significant planning, documentation, or tracking

Some projects, but not all, are also OSG Software area WBS items.
