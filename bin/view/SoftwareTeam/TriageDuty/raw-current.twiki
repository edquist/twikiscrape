---++ Weekly email

An email goes out every Monday at 6 a.m. (Central Time) with the names of the staff on triage duty that week and on the following week. The script that sends out the email lives in SVN as =software/tools/email-triage-duty= and there&#39;s a checkout in =/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools= from where a cronjob runs it. The cronjob runs as the =cndrutil= user on =tonic.cs.wisc.edu= which is a RHEL 5 machine at UW-Madison. It looks like this:&lt;pre&gt;
0 6 * * 1 /s/std/bin/runauth /usr/bin/python /p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools/email-triage-duty -u &#39;https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/h5t4mns6omp49db1e4qtqrrf4g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics&#39; -e osg-software@opensciencegrid.org&lt;/pre&gt;
