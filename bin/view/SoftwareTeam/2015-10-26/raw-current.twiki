*Process changes.* !TimC says thank you to the Software developers for dealing with heightened scrutiny on promotion requests! This will make our releases smoother and better. Carl asked again for clarification about promotion process when !TimC and/or !TimT are out, and since this will happen on Thursday and Friday this week, we will send email about that. Generally speaking, though, there may not be hard-and-fast policies about these situations, but rather specific plans for each outage.
