*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month.

---+++ Notes
We discussed being able to test on EL 7 systems. We believe that we still do not have EL 7 VMs available on fermicloud. John Hover stated that BNL has an !OpenStack infrastructure that we may be able to access on a temporary or perhaps more permanent basis. They have EL 7 VMs that we could use for testing.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Preparing an OASIS release for the next GOC release cycle.  Will be the first one done after code was moved to github.
      * Mat is starting to help with a GOC release repo.  Brian suspects this will take several iterations to get correct.
   * Continued testing with !StashCache.
   * Assisted LIGO in solving !GridFTP issues.
