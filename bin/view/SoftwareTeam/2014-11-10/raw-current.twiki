%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Code Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| November | 3.2.17 / 3.1.41 | 2014-10-27 | 2014-11-03 | 2014-11-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Code Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * Start design for new test scheduling subsystem (!TimC, !BrianL)

---+++ Notes

*Development timing:* This cycle, the Release team is really struggling to finish acceptance testing in time for the release (let alone for the package freeze LAST week). In part, this situation is due to the last-minute and late builds from the Software team. And in general, this problem is only going to get worse as we tighten up the release process to include full ITB testing prior to release. So, for now, I am making a general plea to all Software team developers – please get as many packages into Ready For Testing in advance of the freeze date, thereby increasing testing time and reducing last-minute and late builds.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

---+++ Scaling Tests
---++++ HTCondor Pool Tests
   * We are trying to make SHARED_PORT work at the glidein level. We discovered a bug, so it does not work out of the box since all glideins end up listening on the same port (9618) and choke each other. 
---++++ HTCondor CE Tests
   * New limit reached at 10.5k when using longer running jobs (~6 hours). The knob is at the !JobRouter. And we are waiting for UNL to see if we can further increase it.
