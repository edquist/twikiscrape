---++ Notes

*Client tarballs:* Shipped last week! Now in maintenance mode. Mat has a few updates to add and release (need to figure out release schedule). There is ongoing discussion about the ATLAS requests for extra contents in the clients.

*Java:* Carl will push packages from upcoming-development to upcoming-testing. This is a significant milestone and will likely change the focus of the project from now on. In related news, Oracle shipped a p45 update to its Java 1.6, so we will ship that soon.

*SLURM:* Suchandra fixed the bug and ran lots of jobs successfully. Igor and crew will start scalability testing this week.

*HTCondor:* !BrianB, !BrianL, and !TimC need to discuss remaining tasks. !BrianB has a start, as does !ToddT from the BLAH perspective. Also, we need to rename the package to htcondor. To get started on all of these tasks, we will work on packaging the latest 7.9 release in upcoming. Longer term, we may continue putting development-series releases into upcoming, but we will see if there is adequate interest in that idea. !HTCondor 8.0 will likely spend a bit of time in upcoming, then may migrate back (as 8.0.1 or 8.0.2) into OSG Software 3.1.x. On a related note, there is strong demand for HTCondor 7.8.8, so we may schedule a small release soon to include it and Java 1.6.

*OSG 3.2:* Now that two larger projects are winding down, we should define and estimate tasks to ship a new OSG Software release based on a distinct repository (i.e., 3.2). At very least, this change would mean supporting two separate repositories for a significant period of time (~ 1 year?).
