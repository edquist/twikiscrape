*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

   * Added patch to VOMS to fix SHA-2/RFC proxies ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1333][SW-1333]])
   * Investigated patching fetch-crl for unrecognized config options ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1447][SW-1447]])

   * Prepared racking diagram and SWAP list for Madison ITB machines

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.&lt;/span&gt;

   * Package !XRootD 4 (as =xrootd4=, sigh) (Edgar)
   * Improve osg-configure and RSV support for separate CEs at a single site (Mat)
   * Package privilege-xacml software for GUMS: finish developer testing and promote (Edgar)
   * Support !perfSONAR builds in OSG Koji: waiting for !perfSONAR developers to test (Mat)
   * HTCondor CE and PBS: waiting for Terrence to add a parallel PBS pool at UCSD (Edgar)
   * Disaster recovery for OSG/Madison: improvements as background task, waiting on IU for offsite backups (Mat)
   * Start design for new test scheduling subsystem (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * UW ITB site (Mat, !TimC)
      * Begin experimenting with Puppet on the older hardware
      * New hardware being racked, etc., starting this week (Mat, CHTC Infrastructure)
         * 3 &amp;times; 32 core, 64 GB RAM, 500 GB disk, 1U machines &amp;mdash; for 1 VM node (all head nodes) + 2 execute nodes (64 cores)
         * 2 &amp;times; 2 core, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB disk, 1U machines &amp;mdash; for various storage nodes

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * Document our documentation needs (!TimC)
   * EL7 support
   * !IPv6 evaluation

---+++ Notes

*ITB:* We will continue to push ahead with our own ITB instance. However, at the OSG planning retreat, there was a good discussion about reviving the ITB in general, including getting experiment/VO-specific sites and workflow testing. When we move in this direction, it will likely result in changes to our release process and timing, mostly to leave enough testing time for the (new) ITB sites.

   * Gratia Probe: certinfo files not deleted

   * Suchandra handles this release

---+++ Notes

*Testing results:* From the OSG planning retreat, the notion of measuring and tracking test rejects and bugs that escape the testing process came up.

*Release process:* Carl has done the work to make it easy to add updated binary RPMs to the detailed release notes, so let’s add it to the process.

*Release Announements:* Site admins want to know if an update can be performed without losing any jobs.
