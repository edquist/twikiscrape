*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

*December release.* Good progress last week, resulting in 3&amp;frac12; tickets Ready For Testing. There are still 2 weeks to go, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how many tickets we can finish and end 2016 with a strong release.

*GUMS template.* As has been discussed several times in the past, we are still maintaining the GUMS template in the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; format, then converting it to a newer format to ship. Carl asked whether we can simply move to the newer format. The answer is basically yes, but we need to make sure that we don&amp;rsquo;t break anything for people in the process. We will make sure that there is a JIRA Software ticket to track the discussion and approvals (including Tim&amp;nbsp;C. and Rob&amp;nbsp;Q. at least).

*Quick-Install BOSCO in a container.* Derek noted the ticket from Friday, and asked if OSG Software would be shipping a Docker container. The project is exploratory now, though, so it is too early to know.

---+++ Support Update

   * CHTC (!BrianL) - CHTC has been uploading records of locally run jobs
   * Utah (Derek) - Need to debug RHEL7 jobs and clusters.
   * IIT (Derek) - Running jobs.  Setting up a new CE, which is working.

---+++ Last Week
   * StashCache failure at BNL, caused us to consider problems how to remove caches from the federation.
