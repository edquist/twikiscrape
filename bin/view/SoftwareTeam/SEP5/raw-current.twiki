This SEP is being written before the idea of SEPs has been explored and accepted in OSG. Acceptance of this SEP is contingent upon the SEP idea being accepted.

---++ Proposed changes in OSG 1.2.9.

This is the list of changes we propose to have in OSG 1.2.9. (That is, these are the differences from OSG 1.2.8.) We plan to begin testing OSG 1.2.9 the week of March 22nd. That&#39;s close to the date this SEP was written, so comments on this SEP may affect the testing process. 

The precise versions may change as we proceed with testing.

Likely changes:
   * Update Bestman from 2.2.1.3.8 to 2.2.1.3.10. Allows use of two IP addresses. [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6372][VDT Ticket #6372]]
   * Update !XRootd from 20091028-1003 to 20100315-1007; Update !XRootdFS from 3.0rc3 to 3.0rc4. 
   * Update CEMon from 1.10.1.0 to 1.12.1-9. Fixes bug in generation of !ClassAds when a subset of VOs are configured to use SE. [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6339][VDT Ticket #6339]]
   * Update !GLexec from 0.6.7 to 0.6.8.3-osg1 [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6013][VDT Ticket #6013]]
   * Update OSG Discovery Tools from 0.9.x to 1.0.x [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6514][VDT Ticket #6514]]
   * Update RSV core to fix an bug with quoting. (No known symptom, but could be a serious bug.)
   * Change Globus GRAM 2 (gatekeeper/jobmanager/fork jobs) to run at a lower priority, using nice. Lowers load on CE. [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=5028][VDT Ticket #5028]]
   * Change vdt-ca-manage so it can set up CA certificate infrastructure without installing them. [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6456][VDT Ticket #6456]]
   * Allow vdt-control to run as non-root and run cron jobs as the user. (But not xinetd or init.d services) [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6455][VDT Ticket #6455]]

Changes we&#39;re less certain about
   * Change PRIMA so that it doesn&#39;t ship an extra version of curl. Uncertain because the technical work hasn&#39;t been completed [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6336][VDT Ticket #6336]]
   * Add Hadoop and Xrootd Gratia probes (Some extra technical work needs to be done)
   * Add edg-gridftp-client on behalf of ATLAS. (Not hard, but requires a bit more work) [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=6048][Part of VDT Ticket #6048]]

---++ Schedule
We hope to begin testing the week of March 22nd, 2010. Release depends on ITB testing speed, but hopefully two to three weeks after testing begins, or mid-April.
