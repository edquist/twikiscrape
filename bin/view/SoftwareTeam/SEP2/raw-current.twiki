---++ Note on this SEP
This SEP is being written before the idea of SEPs has been explored and accepted in OSG. Acceptance of this SEP is contingent upon the SEP idea being accepted.

---++ Problem/Motivation

Over time, people ask the OSG software stack to support new platforms (that is, OS/architecture combinations) but it is generally not clear when we can drop support for old platforms. Supporting lots of platforms complicates the task of the VDT team, and we need to focus our effort on the platforms that are most commonly used. We need a process by which we can drop support for platforms when they are no longer needed.

---++ Proposed process for retiring platforms

When the VDT team (or someone else) thinks it that a supported platform is no longer needed and support for the platform is becoming burdensome, the VDT team should write an [[SEP1][SEP]] to propose dropping the platforms. The SEP should specifically state the following:

   1. Exactly which OS and architecture combinations are being considered for retirement.
   1. Why we believe these OS and architectures are no longer being used. 
   1. How the transition to retirement will occur. (Will support be removed? Simply not maintained going into the future? What OSG releases will it affect?)

Once the SEP is written, we must inform all the known OSG VOs of the SEP and give them four weeks to respond. Specifically, we must inform:

   1. The major OSG VOs (CMS, ATLAS, and LIGO), and their OSG liaisons. 
   1. The VOGroup, which will contact the VOs they represent.
   1. The Engage VO, which will contact their users as needed.

Four weeks of silence from these groups is considered to be acceptance of the proposal. Once all groups have responded in the affirmative, or four weeks have elapsed (whichever occurs first), the VDT team may proceed with its plan to drop support for the platforms. Depending on feedback from the VOs may modify the proposal as needed.
