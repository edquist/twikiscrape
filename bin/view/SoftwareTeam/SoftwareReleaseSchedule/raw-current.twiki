---++ OSG Software release schedule

To help with predictability and align with the GOC update schedule, we have adopted a fixed release schedule.  OSG Software will be released on the second Tuesday of the month.  Urgent releases could happen on the fourth Tuesday of the month.

| *Sunday* | *Monday* | *Tuesday* | *Wednesday* | *Thursday* | *Friday* | *Saturday* |
| 25 | 26 (Testing) | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |
| 1 | 2 (Freeze) | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 8 | 9 (Release Prep) | 10 (Release) | 11 | 12 | 13|

Using the example calendar above.  Here are the important dates.

   * *Testing* (Monday, March 26th): The remaining testing is planned for this release.
      * Packages are considered for inclusion in the release on this date.
      * Some additional work on the packages may be done later in the day.
      * All packages to be tested, need to be promoted to the testing repository by the end of the day.
      * We will schedule testing for all packages at this date.
      * If a package is promoted after this date, it may not get tested in time for the release.
   * *Freeze* (Monday, April 2nd): The intended release set is determined.
      * Packages that have been tested will be promoted to the prerelease repository.
      * Packages that have short predictable testing cycle will be accepted for release.
      * In some years, Labor Day will push the &quot;Freeze&quot; date to Tuesday.
   * *Release Prep* (Monday, April 9th): The final selection of packages is determined and packages are promoted or demoted from the prerelease repositories.
      * When all goes well, the repositories will not change.
      * Last minute decision of which packages are included.
      * Packages will be run through the automated tests just prior to release.
   * *Release* (Tuesday, April 10th): The software packages are placed in the release repositories and the release is announce.  Preferably this occurs in the morning.

In summary, the release happens on the first Tuesday of the month.  The decisions about what packages go into the release happens on Mondays.
The 3 Monday dates are chosen to allow discussion during the software meeting to be input to which packages go forward into the release.

Since incorporating certificates into a release is a low risk, well defined process, if an IGTF certificate release (last Monday of the month), happens on the last day of the month (the Freeze date), we still be able to accept the new certificates into the release.
