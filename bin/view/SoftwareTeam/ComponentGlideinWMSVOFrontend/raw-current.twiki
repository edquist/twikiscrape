---+ OSG Software Component: !GlideinWMS VO Frontend

---++ Purpose

This package can be thought of as a Condor submit host (that is, it runs the =condor_schedd=). 
The GlideinWMS VO Frontend includes 
   * A =condor_collector= to gather user jobs
   * A =condor_schedd= to submit jobs
   * A python process to query the collector and communicate with the glideinWMS factory.
The RPM puts all of these on the same host, though they can be split amongst several machines in advanced user installs.

The factory receives resource requests from the frontend, and submits them via condor-g to the various globus gatekeeper queues that it knows about.  These jobs start up and start =condor_startd= processes.  These communicate back to the =condor_collector= on your frontend and begin to run jobs.

The result: you submit jobs on your local cluster, and suddenly machines dynamically pop up from around the grid to run them.

The following animated gif explains the flow of information and jobs.

---++ Usage

The typical usage is to install the glideinwms-vofrontend, configure it to talk to the OSG factory, then submit jobs to the condor pool.
The frontend will find these, request jobs through the factory, and then run the jobs on those requested machines.

Most jobs on the OSG now use pilots of some form, and most outside of ATLAS use !GlideinWMS.

---++ Source

The !GlideinWMS software project develops this.  The funding is mostly through OSG and CMS.

RPMs are usually handled by Doug Strain.  Other notable developers include Igor Sfiligoi (now factory maintainer), Parag Mhashilkar, and Tony Tiradani.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG. (master v3 version for cloud support in osg-contrib)

*NOTE:* those used less frequently, the glideinwms packages also include support for factory installs as well as !CorralWMS, which includes support for !TeraGrid.

---++ History

Derek Weitzel created the initial !GlideinWMS RPMs in about !GlideinWMS 2.4.  Doug Strain has updated it, created a glideinwms-factory rpm, and has updated it to the current version.

---++ Future

!GlideinWMS currently has a v3 branch that includes cloud support and many other new features.  This is currently in osg-contrib, but upon wider adoption, will eventually become the main branch.
