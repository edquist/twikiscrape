Check out [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallGlideinWMSFrontend this URL]] for more information on this component.  Since regular users will only deal with the VO frontend part of GlideInWMS, so in our test, we will focus on this part as well, and use the OSG ITB factory in the testing. Below I will go through some of the major steps involved in the installation and test of this component, more detailed information can be found in [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallGlideinWMSFrontend the document link]].
