%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Version*         | *Testing*  | *Freeze*   | *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.2.14 / 3.1.38 | 2014-07-28 | 2014-08-04 | 2014-08-12 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.
