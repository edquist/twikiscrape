%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| October | 3.3.17 | 2016-09-26 | 2016-10-03 | 2016-10-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

Most tickets ready for testing. New CA certificates available; they will be part of the release since the proposal to decouple data from the release hasn&#39;t been approved yet, or sent to the GOC.

---+++ Support Update

   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - Investigating blahp segfault
   * CERN (!BrianB/!BrianL) - permission denied errors writing to =.log= files on their CE when submitting remote vanilla jobs
   * IIT (Derek) - wants to run both EL 6 and EL 7 jobs behind the same BOSCO CE. It&#39;s an experimental solution, but if it works out, it may become the preferred solution for this kind of thing.
     Expect to see more sites wanting to run EL 6 and EL 7 jobs as they start to transition.

---++ OSG Release Team
   * October 11th Release - OSG 3.3.17
