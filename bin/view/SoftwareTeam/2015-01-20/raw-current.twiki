*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Development Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Information systems work. A “theme” in the next few week will be improvements in the information system and reducing need on BDII.
      * rsv-vo-gwms: A simple probe (based on rsv-perfsonar) meant to help VOs discover which sites will accept their jobs.  Requested by OSG VO.
      * ATLAS-requested change to GIP: Helps ATLAS utilize HTCondor CE (starting with BDII info). Once switched to the BDII, we can make better progress with HTCondor CE (and ultimately the HTCondor CE collector).
      * Put together a plan with the CERN SAM team to advance final pieces of removing BDII use in CMS. Looks like a 2 month timeframe.
   * Improvements requested from Syracuse. Based on a discussion with Peter Couvares late Friday (not all have corresponding tickets). Relevant to this team:
      * Site-local collector (also requested by Miron) - allow startds running at site register their slots with a collector at the local site; allows sites better visibility in what is going on.
      * Help admins notice and debug failing glideins. Concrete task: allow factories to set a “minimum runtime” for jobs. Any job lasting less than the minimum runtime will be put on hold; this will allow admins to discover and diagnose problems.
   * Other: CHEP abstract notifications have been sent out. We will need to coordinate on who will do the work to write papers, attend CHEP, and make posters. HTCondor CE got an oral presentation!
