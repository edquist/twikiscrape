%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| August | 3.2.26 / 3.3.0 | 2015-07-27 | 2015-08-03 | 2015-08-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

   * !BrianB has patches for two issues for Condor:
      * The job router, upon restart, reconnects to the jobs it had already submitted, and will try to stage out the jobs to the local ce instead of the factory. \
        This only affects restarts of the CE, and does not interrupt running pilots, so does not affect production. \
        This fix needs to be applied to the CEs
      * The way the factory queries the job status of the remote CE, it is done in the schedd process instead of forking, so CEs that have heavy loads and/or bad network connectivity to the factory, and other operations time out - so failures submitting jobs, etc. \
        This affects MIT a lot, and they are capping opportunistic jobs heavily. \
        This fix needs to be applied to the Factory
   * Jeff and !BrianB will discuss upgrading the factory. \
     They are willing to install a patched Condor from osg-testing, if we give them one. \
     !TimT will have flightworthy review the patches; \
     separately, OSG will apply the patches to the Condors we&#39;re shipping (both 8.2 and 8.3)
   * Condor 8.3 still failing on EL5; !BrianB may have time to investigate
   * GUMS upgrade causes failing tests; Carl and !BrianB debugging

---+++ Notes

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Progress in testing !StashCache - increasingly good test results w.r.t. concurrency and performance under load. \
     Performance is so good it messes up the graphs
   * OASIS progressing fine; \
     Switching to some new storage targets in the ITB
   * José working on making !AutoPyFactory use the Condor Python bindings
