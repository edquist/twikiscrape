%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| July | 3.3.14 | 2016-06-27 | 2016-07-05 | 2016-07-12 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

   * xrootd-voms-plugin hasn&#39;t been released for EL7 yet, so the new version that Edgar&#39;s packaging will be useful for that as well

---+++ Support Update
   * Harvard (!BrianL) - HTCondor-CE + Slurm seems to be performing much better than their GRAM + LSF setup so they will begin their full transition this week.
   * Texas Tech (!BrianL) - Got root on their CE and found backed up configuration files interfering with their routes, causing jobs to run in the incorrect SGE queue.
   * Utah (Derek/BrianL) - Moved forward with pilot submissions but we&#39;re blocked on missing WN clients because they plan on distributing it via CVMFS. Derek fixed an issue with malformed arguments in the resultant Slurm submit files.

---++ OSG Release Team
   * July 12th Release - OSG 3.3.14 [and OSG 3.2.40]
      * !BrianL is handling the [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20labels%20in%20%283.3.14%2C%203.2.40%29%20ORDER%20BY%20status%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20assignee%20ASC][July 12th Release]]

---+++ Discussion

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Still supporting Utah, though that seems to be winding down.
   * !StashCache now has a real science use case, and has been working well for them.

---+++ Last Week
   * !SchedD segfaulting on Scott&#39;s GOC ce-collector.  Jaime figured it out!  Will be fixed in Condor 8.4.8.
   * Lots of support with Utah.  Grid jobs are working, now to figure out CVMFS installation.

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.
