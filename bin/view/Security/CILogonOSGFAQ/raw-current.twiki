---++What are we using from CILogon?
Note, we are not using CILogon Basic. We are using CILogon HSM which is completely different from CILogon Basic. Note that CILogon has 4 different backend services and they are all different, we are using HSM. If you have a CILogon Basic certificate, you can continue to use that, but when you get a new certificate from OSG, you will get a CILogon HSM, not a CILogon Basic one, so it will be different.

---+++Does this transition mean that my local site will pay for certificates?

No. No changes to current process with regard to fees.

---+++Will my old !DigiCert certificate stop working suddenly?

!DigiCert certificates will work until they expire. Renewals must be done with the new service.

OSG users will continue to use their !DigiCert certificates as usual during the transition period. We will not revoke any CA certificates. 

---+++What happens before the transition?

Nothing until your VO is transitioned to using the new certificates. This will be done over the course of several months starting in January. Notification has begun. More specific information and specific time will be given a month before the transition.

---+++Why am I hearing about this if nothing is happening for months?

We&#39;re trying to set up the schedule for transitions, and want to give people an opportunity to move to a later date if they&#39;re particularly busy during the month we plan to transition them.

---+++Our VOMS server is hosted in another country, how is the transition team helping with that?

We will provide a script for all VOMS admins that will automatically generate the new user DNs and insert them into VOMS database. It is up to your VO to decide whether you want to use this script or not. If you choose not to use it, then users will have to re-register with their new DNs. My recommendation is to lessen the burden on the users. The script is a simple solution; we already know what the new DNs will be for each user so we can put them into the VOMS database ahead of time. But of course it is up to your VO.

---+++What does this transition mean for the end user? What does the end user need to do to get new certificates?

Once end users&#39; certificates are near expiring, they go to OIM to get a new certificate. The process is the same, but the distinguished name (DN) in the certifcate will be the new provider instead of !DigiCert.
Users will need to register their new DN with whatever services they access: DocDB, twiki, etc. *Note, the transition team will provide a script to automatically register the new DN with VOMS.*

---+++I am a !GridAdmin/RA Agent. Will I have the same privileges? If so, will you require anything from my home institution?

Yes, you will continue to act as a !GridAdmin. 
Your home institution is not required to do anything for you to obtain this privilege. 

---+++Will the new certificates be trusted by browsers so we don&#39;t get all sorts of warnings popping up?
Since the previous one was commercial, they paid money to be accepted by browsers. Warning messages may well pop up.
