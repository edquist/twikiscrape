---+ Glidein Hands-on Session, Wednesday July 21st, 2010 

This session will give you hands-on experience in using the glideinWMS.

---++ Session structure

The session is logically split in three pieces:
   * [[GlideinsUserOss2010][Glideins from the user point of view]]
   * [[GlideinsVoOss2010][glideinWMS for the VO administrator]]
   * [[GlideinsFactoryOss2010][glideinWMS for the factory administrator]]

All users should go through the first part ([[GlideinsUserOss2010][for the users]]);&lt;br&gt;
the other two are optional.

I strongly encourage all users to look at the [[GlideinsVoOss2010][frontend]] part;&lt;br&gt;
If you will ever be using a glideinWSM system, it is likely you will get involved in VO frontend administration,
 since you attended this school!

The [[GlideinsFactoryOss2010][glidein factory]] part is instead meant to be for CS students
that want to know more about the internals of the glideins.
