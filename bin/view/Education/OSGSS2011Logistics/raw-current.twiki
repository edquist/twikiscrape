---+ Logistics for the 2011 OSG Summer School

---++ Important Note for Non-US Citizens

If you are not a U.S. citizen, we must make photocopies of certain documents to pay for your travel costs. At minimum, you must bring:

   * Passport
   * U.S. visa
   * Form I-94

Additionally, if you have an *F-1 (Student)* visa, we need Form I-20 as well; if you have a *J-1 (Visitor)* visa, we need Form DS-2019.

Please bring all required documents to the first session, Monday, June 27. One of the School staff will make copies of the documents and return them to you immediately.

---++ Taxis from the airport to the Lowell Center

Please read our [[OSGSS2011Taxis][information on taking a taxi from the airport to the Lowell Center]]. We are asking you to share taxis to reduce our costs. 

---++ Hotel 

Most out-of-town participants are staying at the [[http://conferencing.uwex.edu/lodging.cfm][Lowell Center]], [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=610%20Langdon%20Street%2C%20madison%2C%20wi][610 Langdon Street, Madison, WI]].

The School pays for your hotel stay (unless we have already discussed an exception with you), Sunday through Friday. However, the hotel requires you to provide your own credit or debit card when you check in. It is used for any extra expenses that you have, such as telephone charges or room damage; if you have no extra expenses, your card is not charged.

---++ Welcome Dinner

On Sunday evening, we are hosting a group dinner at 6:30 p.m. at [[http://www.foodspot.com/Clients/WI/Madison/TuttoPastaTrattoria/default.aspx?accid=17593][Tutto Pasta Trattoria]], [[http://maps.google.com/maps?q=305+state+street,+madison,+wi&amp;hl=en&amp;z=16][305 State Street]]

If you arrive in time, Tim Cartwright and Alain Roy ([[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~roy/pictures/FermiPhotoShoot/fullshot.jpg][Picture of Alain]]) will meet you (and other students) in the lobby of the Lowell Center. Then, at 6:20 p.m. or so, the entire assembled group will walk together to the restaurant.

---++ School Location

The school will be held in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/location.html][Computer Sciences Department]], Room 1240, located at [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1210%20West%20Dayton.%2C%20Madison%2C%20Wisconsin][1210 West Dayton St., Madison, WI, 53706]]. It is a 15–20 minute walk from the Lowell Center.

---+++ Getting From the Lowell Center to Computer Sciences

Walking:
   1. Exit the Lowell Center onto Frances Street, and turn right onto Frances Street
   1. Walk down Frances Street until you get to State Street, and turn right onto State Street
   1. Walk down State Street (part street, part pedestrian-only mall) until it ends at Park Street, and turn left onto Park Street
   1. Walk down Park Street until you get to Dayton Street (about three blocks), and turn right onto Dayton Street
   1. Walk until you go just past Charter Street, about three blocks.
   1. The main entrance to the Computer Sciences building is on the right, midway down the block

*Free* bus:
   * The Madison Metro Route 85 stops near the Lowell Center and across the street from Computer Sciences (the “Dayton at Orchard” stop)
   * The 85 bus runs every 20 minutes
   * This route (actually Routes 80–85) are completely free; just get on and off the bus as you wish
   * The official [[http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/schedules/Route85/][Madison Metro Route 85 web page]] shows a route map, bus stop locations, and times (look only at the light blue “R” rows)

School sessions and breakfasts are held in *Room 1240*:

   1. Enter the Computer Sciences building through the glass doors on Dayton Street
   1. Turn left and go through two sets of double doors
   1. Walk down the hallway just a bit
   1. Room 1240 is on the right, up the ramp or a few stairs

The Computer Sciences building is a bit confusing — we will post signs to help you find your way. You can always ask people for directions if you get lost.

---++ Hours

The school is 8:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday. A [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Education/OSGSS2011Schedule][detailed schedule]] is available.

---++ School Meals

The School pays for your meals, which fall into two categories. First, we provide the following meals directly:

   * Breakfasts on Monday through Thursday — held in Computer Sciences Room 1240, the same room as the school sessions
   * Lunches on Monday and Thursday — held in Computer Sciences *Room 2310* (we will guide students there and back)
   * Lunches on Tuesday and Wednesday — held at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, a new and beautiful building located just two minutes from the Computer Sciences building (we will guide students there and back, and we hope to arrange a brief tour of the building on one of those days)

Second, you are on your own for dinners Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and the School will reimburse you after the School. To get your money back, follow these rules:

   * Keep receipts for your dinners
   * Do not exceed $17 per dinner, including tax and tip (no more than 15% tip)
   * We cannot pay for any alcohol, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK — so pay for any alcohol on a separate bill
   * Get a reimbursement form before you leave the School
   * Complete the reimbursement form and send it back to us within a month (details TBD)

---++ Fun

   * [[http://www.union.wisc.edu/][Memorial Union]] is a great place to hang out, just two blocks from the Lowell Center; many people like to get a drink and relax on the Terrace, which looks out over [[http://www.soils.wisc.edu/asig/webcam.html][Lake Monona]]
      * Check [[http://www.union.wisc.edu/events.aspx][the Wisconsin Union events calendar]]
      * For example, Monday night at 9 p.m., _The Blues Brothers_ will be shown outside on the Terrace
