---+ OSG 2010 Summer School — Final Assignment

The 2010 OSG Summer School focused on running large-scale distributed computing applications to support scientific inquiry. We want you to tell us about an interesting computing project that you are or might be involved in. The purpose of this exercise is twofold: We want to know a bit about what you learned at the Summer School, and we are very much interested in the sorts of projects that will require you to apply your new knowledge.

The first step is to pick a project to describe. Ideally, the project is one that you (and/or your team) is working on now or will work on soon. While it needs to be a project that has large-scale computing requirements, it should come from your own domain area: physics, biology, ecology, agronomy, etc. If you are a computer scientist and you do not have a computing project of your own, you will have to find a coworker, colleague, or other faculty/staff member who can tell you about a project; this will mean extra work for you, but perhaps will turn into an interesting collaboration.

Next, think about everything you learned at the Summer School and about the project itself. Spend some time figuring out how you would approach the computational needs of the project using local high-throughput computing resources and/or the Open Science Grid. We are not asking you to implement the project! Just imagine how you would do it. Maybe you will think of one approach to try, maybe you will think of many possible approaches. Imagine that you will run on the resources available to you at your own institution. If your institution does not have a HTC system available, then think about what kind of resources you would want or how you could get access to resources via the OSG.
Now that you have a plan, tell us about it. Write a short paper, maybe 500–1000 words or so (a little more is fine) about:

   * The problem, at a level that we can understand
   * An estimate of the resources (CPUs, time, memory, disk, etc.) that are needed
   * The basic approach(es) you would take

There are many possible questions your paper could address. Below are some suggestions — feel free to answer some (or all) of them, or create and answer your own interesting questions:

   * Would you use just local resources or do you need remote resources, too?
   * How would you turn your project into actual jobs?
   * What are the resource needs of the jobs themselves?
   * What sort of workflow, if any, would you use?
   * How would you find and select remote resources?
   * How much data do you need to move around? How would you deal with it?
   * Do you think your project is better suited for HTC or HPC? Why?
   * What security concerns do you have with your project? Do you need to do anything special regarding security?

This is not a formal paper for submission to a conference or journal, so organize it as you wish. However, please strive to represent yourself and your project well, as we may share your work with colleagues (yours and ours), others in the field, and with funding agencies who may support future summer schools.

Please complete the assignment no later than August 31st, 2010, but we strongly encourage you to complete it before TG’10. When you are done, email us a PDF of your completed paper. Later, we may ask for the original text, if we decide to compile all of the papers or samples from them.

If you have any questions or comments about this assignment, email Tim or Alain (directly or via the mailing lists you used already), or contact your mentor.
