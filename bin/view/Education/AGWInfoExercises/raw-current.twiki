---+!! Tutorial: Grid Information Systems and Monitoring

%TOC%


---+ &lt;nop&gt;GridCat

Look at the Open Science Grid installation of &lt;nop&gt;GridCat, at http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/ 

At the top of the page is a map. At the bottom is a table of resource information.

Answer these questions using the information on the &lt;nop&gt;GridCat page:

   1. Where is the nearest OSG installation to Santa Fe? (Use the map)
   1. How many sites are on the Open Science Grid now?
   1. Sort the list of sites by CPU.
   1. Which site has the most CPUs? How many CPUs?
   1. Which site has the fewest CPUs? How many?

---+ MDS


---++ MDS locally

We will use MDS from the command line on d4.

We will ask the local RFT service for monitoring information:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ wsrf-query -s https://170.210.11.102:8443/wsrf/services/ReliableFileTransferFactoryService | less
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will display a lot of XML information. Look through the information. Try to find:

| !TotalNumberOfBytesTransferred | This is the total number of bytes that were transferred by this RFT service. |
| !TotalNumberOfActiveTransfers | This is the total number of transfers that RFT is processing at the moment. |


---++ MDS on the Teragrid

Now we will use the Teragrid MDS installation.

The MDS information can be seen in a web browser here:

http://mds.teragrid.org:8080/webmds/webmds?info=indexinfo&amp;xsl=tg_gluesummaryxsl

Which machine has the most CPUs?

Which LRMs (local resource managers) are used on the teragrid?
