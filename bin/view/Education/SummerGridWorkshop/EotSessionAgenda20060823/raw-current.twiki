---+++ Agenda Notes

- Kate Keahey (Argonne) and Dave Braun (Purdue) want to discuss use of VM technology for Grid education labs

- Scott Lathrop suggested the following discussion topics:

   * review state of grid computing integration into curriculum (across all disciplines)
   * discuss whether/how we might survey the community and collect grid computing curricular materials - and post them to CSERD/NSDL - especially best practices
   * identify gaps that we could work on to fill - we have some SC Pathways funds to run a workshop to get people together to develop materials to fill the gaps!!
   * identify strategies to engage the community, beyond the SC effort
   * solicitations/proposals we should be developing for larger scale efforts
