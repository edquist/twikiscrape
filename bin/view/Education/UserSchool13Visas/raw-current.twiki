---+ Visa Requirements

If you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, we must have copies of certain documents to pay your expenses. Read this entire page for more details.

---++ Tasks To Do Now

Please check your passport and visa for travel in the United States now. Make sure that all documents are valid from now and until after the School. If any documents are expired or will expire before the end of the School:

   * Tell us immediately, so that we can help you
   * Begin the process for updating your documents immediately
   * Do whatever you can to expedite the update process

The University of Wisconsin cannot pay for or reimburse you for costs without valid travel documents. We have no control over this policy and there are no exceptions.

   * You must provide a letter from your sponsoring organization giving us permission to reimburse you for travel expenses
   * We cannot pay any of your expenses until we receive the letter
   * The letter must come before any travel planning, so get it soon

---++ Documents to Bring to the School

When you come to Madison, you must bring:

   * Passport
   * U.S. visa
   * U.S. Customs and Border Protection [[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/i-94_instructions/][form I-94]] (if entered the U.S. before 30 April 2013)

*Note:* The I-94 was given to you when you arrived in the United States. It is a fairly small piece of paper and should have been stapled into your passport. If it is, do not remove it from your passport! Just bring your passport with the I-94 and we will make copies of all necessary pages.

Additionally, if you have an *F-1 (Student)* visa, we need Form I-20 as well; if you have a *J-1 (Visitor)* visa, we need Form DS-2019.

Please bring all required documents to the first session, Monday, June 24. School staff will make copies of the documents and return them to you as quickly as possible.
