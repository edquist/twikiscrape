The workshop introduces essential skills that will be needed by students in the natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.

Participants will work with leading experts in grid computing, through a blend of lectures, discussions and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources.

---++ Location

The workshop will be held Friday-Sunday June 8-10 on the main campus of the University of Texas at Brownsville Campus, in the Science, Engineering and Technology Building (SETB) Room 1.508.
