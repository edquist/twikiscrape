---+ Breakfast discussions at the OSG Summer School 2010

*The school has now completed. A big thank you to everyone involved--it was an educational and fun experience!*

Each morning, there will be breakfast from 8:00 to 8:45am. (The caterers will clean up between 8:45 and 9:00am.) But we want to feed not just your belly, but your minds!

The breakfasts will be shared between the OSG Summer School and the (co-located) OSG Staff Retreat. Each morning, several OSG staff will join the school for breakfast. We want to stimulate interesting discussions between everyone.

We do realize that not everyone is fully awake at 8:00am, so to aid our discussions, we&#39;ve prepared a list of questions. We&#39;d like all of you (students and staff) to think over these questions (and answers) the day before. You are, of course, welcome to take the discussion in other directions.

---+++ Questions for Monday, July 19th (Room 4310)
   * 1. What sorts of problems are you working on that (might) benefit from large-scale distributed computing?
   * What amazing things could you do with 10x more computing resources? 1,000x?  1,000,000x?
   *  If you owned a cluster of 100 compute machines, how would you use them?  Would you let anyone else use them?  What sorts of usage policies might you need to ensure fair use of your cluster?  Would things change if you owned 1,000 machines?  10,000 machines?

---+++  Questions for Tuesday,  July 20 (Room 4310)
   * Describe (at least) one interesting computational challenge you would like to use Condor for.  How might you approach the challenge, in terms of Condor jobs?  Do you have just 1 job?  Lots of them? Would you use a DAG?
   * What kinds of resources matter to large-scale computing? That is, what can we run out of?  What sorts of jobs are likely to push one kind of resource versus another?
   * Imagine that our single, local cluster was not enough to meet our goals.  If we wanted to use multiple clusters at a time, what are some of the challenges we would face?  What kinds of new techniques might be needed to move beyond one cluster?

---+++ Questions for Wednesday, July 21  (Room 4310)
   * Now you know how to run jobs EVERYWHERE!  The world (of computing) is yours!  Now what?  Now how would you approach your big computing challenges?  What changes, if anything, as you move from a local Condor cluster to the grid?
   * Suppose your boss/professor/superior came to you and asked you to solve a brand-new problem using HTC.  What sorts of questions are important to ask?  What do you need to know before you start setting up jobs and a workflow?
   * Suppose I offer you 10,000 compute slots on the grid.  What do you want to know about those slots?  Does it matter?

---+++ Questions for Thursday, July 22  (Room 4310)
   * What does HTC mean to you?  Could you distinguish between HTC and HPC?  How about The Grid and The Cloud?  What _is_ The Cloud, anyway
   * What do the terms privacy and security mean to you and your research? Would you openly publish all of your data?
