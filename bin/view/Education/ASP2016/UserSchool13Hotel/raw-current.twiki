---+ Hotel Information

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [[http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-madison-MSNDTDT/ DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Madison]], located on West Johnson Street near campus, just a few blocks from where classes will be held. The hotel is walking distance to the Computer Sciences building, but in the event of inclement weather, they have a shuttle for transporting students.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---++ 1. If We Offered to Pay for Your Hotel Room

All you need to do is tell us your travel plans (arrival and departure dates and times), and we will reserve your room and pay for basic room costs. One student per room.

*NOTE:* Even if we are paying for your hotel room, when you check in, you must provide the hotel with a credit card — it is only for optional expenses that you cause by yourself. We will pay only for the room charge and its taxes.

---++ 2. If You Are Paying for Your Hotel Room

You may stay anywhere you like, although we suggest that you let us reserve one of the !DoubleTree rooms for you. It is convenient and the rates are very competitive for this part of Madison. Nearly all School events will be held in the Computer Sciences building, only a few blocks from the hotel. It is your choice, but if you decide to stay at the !DoubleTree, you must let us know your travel plans (arrival and departure dates and times) so that we can reserve the room.

No matter where you stay, please tell us where it is, so that we know how to contact you locally.
