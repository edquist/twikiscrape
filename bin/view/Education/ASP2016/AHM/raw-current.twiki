---+!! Grid Computing Tutorial 2008 

The Grid Computing Tutorial will be part of the [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&amp;amp;confId=1037#2008-03-06][New User Training at the All Hands Consortium meeting]] *March 6 2008*  at *RENCI -- Chapel Hill, NC*.

 *Thursday March 6 2008 -- 9 am to 5 pm* 

This tutorial introduces the techniques of grid and distributed       
computing for science and engineering fields, with hands-on training in the     
use of national grid computing resources. The tutorial introduces essential     
skills that will be needed by researchers in the natural and applied            
sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support              
large-scale computation and data analysis in emerging grid and distributed      
computing environments.  

The material will focus on enabling the use of national     
cyberinfrastructure - *Open Science Grid* and *TeraGrid* - to perform             
large-scale computations and data-intensive processing in various fields of     
research. Participants will learn to use grids of thousands of processors       
and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after    
the workshop.              

The workshop will cover:                                                        
       
&lt;ul&gt;                                                                        
  &lt;li&gt; Overview of distributed computing concepts and tools                         
  &lt;li&gt; Concepts, tools, and techniques of grid computing                            
  &lt;li&gt; Discovering and using grid resources                                         
  &lt;li&gt; Grid scheduling and distributed data management                              
  &lt;li&gt; Web service and grid service concepts                                        
  &lt;li&gt; Techniques for workflow and collaboration  
&lt;/ul&gt;

Undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, educators and                 
professionals in engineering, computer science, or any scientific, data- or     
computing-intensive discipline are encouraged to participate.
                                                                                
Intermediate programming skills (in C/C++, Java, Perl, and/or Python) and hands-on          
experience with UNIX / Linux in a networked environment are strongly recommended.

---++ Aim and Purpose
The aim of the workshop is to give the students a basic foundation in distributed computing, and valuable hands-on training in computing techniques. The training session introduces essential skills that will be needed by participants in the natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.
