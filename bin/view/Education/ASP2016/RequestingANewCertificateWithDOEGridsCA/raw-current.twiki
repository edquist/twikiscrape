Each person in your team will now request a certificate from the DOEGrids certificate authority.

Here&#39;s the long command-line to type. You must modify some of the parameters. Make sure you do this before submitting the request.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;userinput&gt;cert-request -agree -ou p -name &quot;Your Name Here&quot; -email youremail@somewhere.edu  \
    -phone &quot;+111-111-1111&quot; -reason &quot;Grid school&quot; -affiliation osg -vo osgedu -label YOURNAME   \
    -sponsor_name &quot;Mike Wilde&quot;&lt;/userinput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will need to change  -name, -email, -phone and -label.

You will be asked for a secret passphrase. Choose one. Do not forget this passphrase - it cannot be reset by the course administrators.

When you have submitted your request, the other person in your team should request a certificate using a similar command. Make sure to change -name -email -phone and -label so that you do not overwrite each other&#39;s credentials.
