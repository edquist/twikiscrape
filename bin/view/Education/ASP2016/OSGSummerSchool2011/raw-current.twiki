---+ 2011 OSG Summer School

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn to harness the power of distributed computing!*

During the school, June 26–30, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[OSGSS2011Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in computer science or other sciences where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, but any qualified and interested applicant will be considered. We will open the application process starting on March 1, 2011. Successful applicants will have all travel and school expenses paid for by the OSG. Furthermore, as part of a collaboration with [[https://www.teragrid.org/][TeraGrid]], students will go to the annual !TeraGrid Conference (TG11, July 18–21, 2011 in Salt Lake City, Utah) with all travel and conference expenses paid. This is a great opportunity!

---++ Applications

Applications closed on April 1, 2011, and we notified applicants of our decisions on April 15, 2011. Thanks for your interest!

&lt;!--
---++ Apply Now!

Applications are now open. The *deadline for applications is Friday, April 1, 2011,* end of the day. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

   1. Complete the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/osgss-2011-app/][online application form]]
   1. Have a letter of recommendation emailed to gridschool-2011-info@opensciencegrid.org. (Any reasonable format for the letter is fine.)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify you and the 2011 OSG Summer School in the letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

   * Be graduate students (but we have a few openings for compelling undergrads, faculty, or staff)
   * Be interested in grid computing, from the perspective of either computer science or a scientific end-user
   * Have basic experience with the Linux command line

---++ Spread the Word

Please spread information about the school to people you know who may be interested. If you have a place to post a flyer for the school, we&#39;ve got one ready for you.
