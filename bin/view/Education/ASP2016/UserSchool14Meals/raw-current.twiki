---+ Meals and Food during the School

All group meals that are organized by the School will include vegetarian options.

---++ Group Dinners

On Sunday evening, we are hosting a group welcome dinner at 6:30 p.m. (details announced later) at one of the two student union buildings located on the UW–Madison campus. If you arrive in time, Tim Cartwright will meet you (and other students) in the lobby of the !DoubleTree. Then, about 10 minutes before the start of dinner, the entire assembled group will walk together to the Union.

On Thursday evening, we are hosting a group closing dinner, again at one of the student unions. The exact time, location, and meeting place(s) will be announced later.

---++ School Meals

The School pays for your meals, which fall into two categories. First, we provide the following meals directly:

   * Breakfasts on Monday through Thursday — held in Computer Sciences Room 1240, the same room as the school sessions
   * Lunches on Monday through Thursday — held in a lobby of the Computer Sciences building (we will guide students there and back)

Second, you are on your own for dinners Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and we will reimburse you after the School. To get your money back, follow these rules:

   * Keep receipts for your dinners
   * Do not exceed $20 per dinner, including tax and tip
   * We cannot pay for any alcohol, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK — so pay for any alcohol on a separate bill
   * Get a reimbursement form before you leave the School
   * Complete the reimbursement form and send it back to us within a month or so (details TBD)
