---+++ Mentor Reports
%BLUE%Alain Roy%ENDCOLOR% has been helping 2 students get them access to OSG via the Engage VO.

%BLUE%Jim Weichel%ENDCOLOR% worked (via email) with all 4 students on final papers which have all been submitted and approved.  (Papers can be viewed on the [[OSGSS2011Assignment][Final Assignment Page]].)  Based on final papers, some will be working with HTPC, but none have come to OSG so far.

%BLUE%Zach Miller%ENDCOLOR% has received the final assignments from all 4 students but he has not reviewed them.  He will read those and get back to the students.

---+++ Student Reports
%BLUE%Igor Senderovich%ENDCOLOR% has started running jobs using glideinWMS.  He is working some issues in their code that need to be addressed before submitting out onto the grid.  Other issues, like carrying along dependencies and so forth, have been addressed already.  This sounds like real progress.

%BLUE%Yasi Khorramzadeh%ENDCOLOR% is using SGE at Virginia Tech since it does not have condor.  She used the DAGMAN idea in writing shell scripts to control her jobs.  Zach will followup with Yasi on installing Condor as a submitter into SGE so she can use the real DAGMAN.

%BLUE%Javier Tabima%ENDCOLOR% is just installing grid software at Universidad de los Andes.  He wants to use it in the biology clusters (2 clusters one with 12 machines with 24 cores each another with 8 machines with 5 cores each).  The second cluster will be a condor cluster.  They are also trying to integrate with the Colombian grid, so he could get access to more machines that way.  Tim will follow up and learn more.

%BLUE%Ray Sehgal%ENDCOLOR% is just about to go onto the Grid since he has exhausted his local resources for his Chemical Engineering work and now needs to broaden the parameter sweep.  Ray plans to use OSG via the Engage VO.

%BLUE%Julio Goez%ENDCOLOR% is experimenting with problem using condor and DAGMAN.  He is trying to get real (vs test) data from industry now that he has it working.  Has a 200 core cluster with 16 cores/machine with 32 GB memory.  Julio has been trying to get people to use condor at Lehigh.  He reports that his mentor, Igor, has been a great help via email exchanges.

%BLUE%Terrence Neumann%ENDCOLOR% was unable to be at the meeting because he was meeting with collaborators discussing a recent grant award that may fund his work as a postdoc.  He sent the following report:%BR%
After leaving the OSG workshop this summer, I helped my research advisor move institutions and have been getting our experimental lab up and running.  So the application of the items I learned in Madison has been limited.  We are currently building a Condor cluster and I am planning on joining the eNMR VO as my advisor&#39;s focus is nuclear magnetic resonance.  As I finish my doctoral degree, I&#39;ll be working through the proposal I prepared for as the OSG Summer School final project.  I intend to test these ideas on our Condor cluster and then submit jobs to OSG clusters. 
As I move into a postdoc (I&#39;ll likely be staying with my Ph.D. advisor), I am interested in further refining my HTC skills.  I&#39;m hoping to attend Condor week with some of my new colleagues at Concordia University Wisconsin.

!GridColombia has a few resources available and validated by RSV, (GCVO_PUJ_CE and  GCVO_UC_CE) and a few more in the process of being validated.
Meanwhile, we are waiting for more institutions who have completed the installation (CE) process to finish the registration process in OIM.  
We now have 2 VO&#39;s Operational and distributed in VDT package (GCVO and GCEDU).  
This is the [[https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?map_attrs_shownr=on&amp;all_sites=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;disable_value=1&amp;gridtype=on&amp;gridtype_1=on#6.948239,-73.476562|6|Relieve][MyOSG Map pointed to Colombia]].  
This is the GCEDU (!GridColombia Education VO)  [[https://gc-voms.javeriana.edu.co:8443/voms/gcedu/Login.do][Registration URL]].  On October 27, 2011, we start a training school for instructors of institutions from all the country using Condor and !CondorG tools, with some of the content learned in the Wisconsin School. The main idea to have those instructors go to their institutions and replicate the knowledge.  Parallel to the training job, we are setting up a new VO in Bioinformatics that will have many more resources than the GCVO and GCEDU VO&#39;s.

%BLUE%Weiwei Chen%ENDCOLOR% sent the following report:%BR%
I have analyzed and quantified the overheads in scientific workflows. Different platforms such as !TeraGrid, !FutureGrid, Amazon EC2 and local clusters have been evaluated. I also examined the impact of different optimization techniques such as provisioning tools (!GlideinWMS), data pre-staging, task clustering and so on. I&#39;m going to present the work at SC11.
