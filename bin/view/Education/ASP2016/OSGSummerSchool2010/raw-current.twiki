---+ 2010 OSG Summer School

*The school has now completed. A big thank you to everyone involved--it was an educational and fun experience!*

%GRAY%
Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn to harness the power of distributed computing!

During the school, July 19–22, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[CurriculumOSS2010][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in computer science or other sciences where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, but any qualified and interested applicant will be considered. We are accepting applications now for students. Successful applicants will have all travel and school expenses paid for by the OSG. Furthermore, as part of a collaboration with [[https://www.teragrid.org/][TeraGrid]], students will go to the annual !TeraGrid Conference (TG’10, August 2–5 in Pittsburgh, PA) with all travel and conference expenses paid. This is a great opportunity!

---+++ Final Assignment

Students: Please complete the short paper, described below, by the end of the summer. We suggest doing it before TG’10, while the ideas from the summer school are still fresh in your mind. We believe that the assignment will be helpful to you as well as us, and that it will take not too much of your time.
