---++ Which Condor?
We will be using Condor 7.4.2, which is the most recently released stable version of Condor.

Condor has two coexisting types of releases at any given time: stable and development. Condor and 7.2.x 7.4.x are considered stable releases, and you can know they are stable because the second digits (a 2 or a 4 in these cases) are  even numbers. In a given stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug fixes.

Condor 7.4.2 is the latest stable release of Condor. You know it&#39;s a stable release because the second digit (a 4) is an even number.

Condor 7.5.3 is the latest development release of Condor. You know it&#39;s a development release because the second digit (a 5) is an odd number. Development releases add new features and are more likely to have serious bugs. This is the fourth release in the development series. We&#39;re not using it, because the stable release is more stable. We have no desire to inflict the latest bugs created by the Condor team on you.

The next stable release, 7.6.x, should be available in the fall of 2010. 

---++ The Exercises

Throughout the Condor exercises, you will be given a fair amount of guidance. In several spots, there are suggestions for extra exercises to do &quot;on your own&quot; or as &quot;challenges&quot;. Since you aren&#39;t being graded, there is no extra credit for doing them, but we encourage you to try them out. If you prefer, you can come back to the extra credit after you&#39;ve completed the basic exercises. If you simply cruise through the exercises, you&#39;ll probably have free time--we encourage you to delve in more deeply.

For all of the exercises, we&#39;ll assume that you are logged into =vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu=.
