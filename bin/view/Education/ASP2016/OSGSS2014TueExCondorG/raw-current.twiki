---+ 2014 OSG User School - Using directly the Grid

Node to use: Same as [[OSGSS2014TueExOSGSec][the previous exercise]].

In this session, we will submit jobs directly to the Grid using HTCondor-G.

HTCondor-G jobs are very similar to _normal_ HTCondor jobs,
in the sense that you use the standard HTCondor tools, like _condor_submit_  and _condor_q_.

The main difference is that you use the *grid* universe, instead of the *vanilla* one.

Moreover, HTCondor does not really schedule the jobs end-to-end;
it merely _throws them over the fence_ and _keeps a look on what&#39;s going on there_.

To better understand what I mean by this, we will submit a few test jobs with HTCondor-G,
and monitor what happens.

Pick any compute problem you like, and replace the 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
universe = vanilla
&lt;/pre&gt;
line with
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
universe = grid
grid_resource=gt5 osg-ss-ce.chtc.wisc.edu/jobmanager-condor
&lt;/pre&gt;

Set
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
export X509_USER_PROXY=~/.globus/proxy.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;
and you are now ready to submit a HTCondor-G job with _condor_submit_.&lt;br&gt;
*Note:* HTCondor-G cannot determine what output files you want back, so if you need anything past stdout and stderr, you will have to explicitly list them.

You have login access to osg-ss-ce. Please do log into it, and run _condor_q_ there.&lt;br&gt;
What you will see is another HTCondor pool, and it now has your job queued there!&lt;br&gt;
(Note: it may be hard to find, due to the Grid interface mangling the arguments)

What has happened is that *our* HTCondor-G just re-submitted your jobs to the HTCondor running on osg-ss-ce.&lt;br&gt;
osg-ss-ce now has full ownership of your jobs, and will run them to completion (if at all possible).&lt;br&gt;
Our HTCondor-G just monitors the remote HTCondor-G and periodically updates its internal status.

If you have submitted a job that takes a significant time to complete, please monitor the status of your job both through _condor_q_ / _condor_history_ and by parsing the job log.&lt;br&gt;
You should notice that you get way less information on the HTCondor-G side, than when logged directly into osg-ss-ce.&lt;br&gt;
Take some time understanding what are the differences.

*Note:* For most real-life Grid resources you have no direct login access to the remote scheduler (which, BTW, may not be HTCondor-based), so you will have to rely on HTCondor-G monitoring alone.
