----+ Accelerating transfers with HTTP caching

Some of your computing works  require transferring  the same set of input files over and over again. In such cases, caching the data on a computing site may reduce the data transfer delays.  As we discussed in the lecture, the squid proxy has been installed on many sites that caches the data for frequent usage. 

---++ Setup

You can get started using the template below:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
universe = vanilla
executable = namd_run.sh
output =
error = 
log = 
requirements = (HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= TRUE)
queue
&lt;/pre&gt;
Remember that the =requirements= line is needed to tell HTCondor to only match against job slots that have the OASIS software library available (you may refer [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634394-accessing-software-using-distributed-environment-modules][here]]). 
Don&#39;t forget to specify the =output=, =error=, and =log=!

We take care of the input file transfer in the wrapper script. First, copy the NAMD files to your =~/public/namd-input-files= directory.
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% mkdir -p ~/public/namd-input-files
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% cp  /stash/public/userschool2015/namd/*  ~/public/namd-input-files/.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the wrapper script, set the =http_proxy=  is equal to =OSG_SQUID_LOCATION= so that the squid cache on a site is used for data transfer.  Here, we use =wget= to transfer the input files. Our wrapper script is:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# Set up the proxy to take advantage of cache
export http_proxy=$OSG_SQUID_LOCATION

# Transfer input files using wget command
wget http://stash.osgconnect.net/+username/namd-input-files/ubq.pdb
wget http://stash.osgconnect.net/+username/namd-input-files/ubq.psf 
wget http://stash.osgconnect.net/+username/namd-input-files/ubq_gbis_eq.conf
wget http://stash.osgconnect.net/+username/namd-input-files/par_all27_prot_lipid.inp

# Use the NAMD module from OASIS 
source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/current/init/bash
module load namd/2.9

# Execute NAMD
namd2 ubq_gbis_eq.conf &gt; ubq_gbis_eq.log
&lt;/pre&gt; 
Save the wrapper as =namd_run.sh= and remember to make it executable with =chmod +x namd_run.sh=. 

Note that =username= in the wrapper script is your username on ==login.osgconnect.net==.


Once the submit and wrapper script files are ready, submit the job. 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_submit namd_run.submit
&lt;/pre&gt;

Again, the job should run 5 minutes or so. If the job was successful, you should see a bunch of output files in the directory you submitted from. You can verify that the input files were downloaded by looking at the =output= file you created in your job.
