---+ !!Thursday Exercise 1.2: Do the OSG Connect Quickstart

For this exercise, you&#39;ll follow an online guide from the OSG Connect helpdesk that will acquaint you with submission on the OSG Connect submit server, which is very similar to submission on other OSG submit points, like =osg-learn=.

---++ Setup

   * Make sure you are logged into =login.osgconnect.net= (the OSG Connect submit server).
   * Navigate to your =stash= directory within the home directory (where you should always submit jobs from on =login.osgconnect.net=), and create a directory for this exercise named =quickstart=.

---++ Follow the &quot;OSG Connect Quickstart&quot; tutorial

From the [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home][OSG Connect helpdesk]], under &quot;OSG Connect User Guide&quot;, select the &quot;OSG Connect Quickstart&quot;. Follow this guide through Job 2, then move on with the next exercise.

*IMPORTANT* Make sure to use the &quot;UserSchool2016&quot; project name, by changing or adding the following to any submit files, before the =queue= line:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
+ProjectName = &quot;UserSchool2016&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
