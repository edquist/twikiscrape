&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?&lt;/p&gt;

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, July 7–10, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool14Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, faculty, and staff. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #F60;&quot;&gt;Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School.&lt;/span&gt;
