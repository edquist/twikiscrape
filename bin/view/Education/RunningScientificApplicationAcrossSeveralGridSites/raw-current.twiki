---+!! Run a &quot;Scientific Application&quot; across several Grid sites

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

Here are several sites that you can access using your Grid certificate:

| *Site Name* | *Gatekeeper* | *Sched* | *CPUs* | *GridFTP* |
| LAB1 | =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu= | Condor | 16  | =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu= |
| LAB2 | =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu= | Condor | 16 | =gridlab2.phys.utb.edu= |
| LAB3 | =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu= | Condor | 16 | =gridlab3.phys.utb.edu= |
| LAB4 | =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu= | Condor | 16 | =gridlab4.phys.utb.edu= |
| ISI | =skynet-login.isi.edu= | PBS | 90 | =skynet-login.isi.edu= |
| ANL-UC | =tg-grid.uc.teragrid.org= | PBS | 32 | =tg-grid.uc.teragird.org= |
| NCSA | =tg-login.ncsa.teragrid.org= | PBS | 512 | =tg-login.ncsa.teragrid.org= |
| SDSC | =tg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org= | PBS | 512 | =tg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org= |


Try a few of these using the simple examples you learned above. Write a simple test script of =globus-job-run= commands that checks if all these sites are working for you.

---+++ Final Review Exercise
Pretend that &quot;genr&quot; is a compute intensive simulation program that you want to run on the Grid.  Your last task in this lab is to create 5 lists of 10 random numbers each: 1-digit numbers in the first file, 2-digit numbers in the second file, and so on.  

Since this work is &quot;compute intensive&quot;, you want to run these jobs under the batch job manager at each site, *not* the fork job manager. Use either =jobmanager-pbs= or =jobmanager-condor=, according to the table above.  

And, of course, you want to do it all in parallel, in a script so that you can reproduce your results as needed.
