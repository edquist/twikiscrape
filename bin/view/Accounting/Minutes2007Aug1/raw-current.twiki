---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++DB and Schema issues

Penelope: I saw the talk from EBay about their DB organization maybe we can use some of their pattern.

Philippe: Actually we are planning  to use this kind of horizontal splitting when we can upgrade to the 
next MySQL production version.

---++Collector

John: Even-though OSG 1.8.0 has been release we need to update the collector for a couple of smallish issue.

John: We still have an issue when shutting down tomcat.

---++Report development

Penelope: I now have a prototype of multiple selection.  How should access the list of VOName to be listed.

Philippe: select distinct(VO.VOName) from VO, VONameCorrection where VO.VOid = VONameCorrection.VOid order by VO.VOName

Jeff: Should we use a set of check boxes instead?

Philippe: Not for the moment.  Let&#39;s get the current scheme rolling in production, we can extend later.

Chris: We should add a new column to the VO table, sometime like &#39;Hide&#39; to be able to disable ancient/wrong VO.&#39;

All: In the GUI, should the end date specify by the user be inclusive or not (it currently is exclusive) or should
request a date/time instead.
