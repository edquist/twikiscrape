 [WARN]: A C3P0Registry mbean is already registered. This probably means that an application using c3p0 was
 undeployed, but not all PooledDataSources were closed prior to undeployment. This may lead to resource leaks over 
 time. Please take care to close all PooledDataSources.

&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Miscellaneous
   1 initd service: the wget for stopDatabaseUpdateThreads never
                 made it into VDT.  Not sure if this is supposed to be
                 some special instructions or part of make.  Assume former.
