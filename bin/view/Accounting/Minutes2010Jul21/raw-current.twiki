---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

Dan:  Turns out that housekeeping had not yet caught up at all.   Prod is one week behind.   Transfer is still 4 months behind.    However the new housekeeping is working so well that it is triggering intense &#39;row purging&#39; by innodb which slow down operation and has prevented the collector from catching up with the incoming records (accumulated turning the upgrade last week).

Philippe: To solve the housekeeping backlog on the Transfer database we could consider dropping (allmost) all the details data from the schema and start fresh since the amount of data to be kept is 1 months.

Philippe: So I proposed to disable the housekeeping both collector catch up with incoming data.  And then to try enabling the housekeeping only for the production collector until it is caught up and then and only then to try with transfer.

Keith: FermiGrid does agree with this plan.

Philippe: What is the estimate for catching up with incoming data?

Dan: I am guessing that we should be caught up with incoming records in a day or two.
