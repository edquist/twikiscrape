Penelope: I have logged another bug report to Birt where there event handle seems to be executed on the &#39;wrong&#39; report after the first report displayed (first after a tomcat restart!)

Chris:  The PBS/LSF probe are not properly configured by osg-configure.sh.  There is some hope to fix it (and automating it).

our code).

Here&#39;s my Gratia related status for this week:

1. Trying to get new ERD created since much has changed.
    - problems accessing since last time even with reader.

2. Duplicates.
    - these are the heavy hitting sites so far.

3. APEL interface
a. update the APEL interface for all the ATLAS Tier 2 sites.
    - updated back through 7/1/2006 for the ealries entry.
    - committed changes
b. Talked to Ian Fisk about what his concern that there was a 
significant drop off in cms usage.  I queried what I was sending and 
usage actually increased for cms/uscms.  He is only seeing cms and not 
uscms on the email report he is getting. He questioned why we even 
report uscms or usatlas and why it is not all just cms/atlas Per 
Philippe, this is what Frank W requested and WLCG is supposed to have 
a !CorrectedVO type table to account for  the various views.
