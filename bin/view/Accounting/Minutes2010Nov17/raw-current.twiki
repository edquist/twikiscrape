---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

Philippe:  Restarted work on the Probe release.  Collector release still planed for early January.

---+Services Operation

Dan: Everything going well.   Gratia will be shutdown at 4:15am tomorrow for the Fermilab power shutdown.   It will be manually restarted around 9am or more exactly once the network is backup and stable.

Dan: BlueRidge is now reporting properly (the probe was looking in the wrong place).

Dan: Disk space is still very fine (plateau-ed and is now growing _very_ slowly).

Dan: Gratia Operation would like some logic in the tomcat initrc to test for the health of the mysql server (no point is starting without it).
