---+ The case for !InnoDB

---++ Overview

This document attempts to marshal the arguments for making the transition to using %I% as the engine underlying Gratia&#39;s !MySQL DBs and address with substantive data where possible possible differences between the two systems, especially in performance.

The major difference between %I% and %M% is that %I% supports transactions and true atomic inserts.

---++ Pertinent characteristics of the Gratia system.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A single coherent &quot;record&quot; updates several tables not including summary tables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Summary tables are updated currently by triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The per-job usage data are large (~2K per row). This may be cut down by schema updates in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current understanding of OSG requirements call for for ~1.5TB of per-job data storage, equating to a year&#39;s worth of job-level data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The collector system is capable of running multiple DB update threads if the underlying DB engine supports it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eventually, summary tables will be generated periodically rather than by triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reports are generally produced using data obtained from &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; generated stored procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

---++ Limitations of the current Gratia system perceived to be due at least in part to limitations of the %M% engine.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large job-level queries are slow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data are vulnerable to corruption as a result of connection loss for any reason between collector and DB.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long queries (including nightly reporting to WLCG) and backup operations (=mysqlhotcopy=, =mysqldump=) lock out the DB for reads as well as writes, sometimes for hours (production system is regularaly stalled for &gt;1h every night).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insert throughput cannot be increased to the DB using multiple update threads unless the underlying DB engine supports transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

---++ Performance comparisons of Gratia operations with %M% and %I%

---+++ Implementation notes

The Gratia system has already been adapted to enable automatic upgrade of an existing %M% schema to %I%. 

Enabling conversion to %I% on a given collector installation is as simple as changing one line in =hibernate.cfg.xml= provided optimum configuration settings are enabled in !MySQL&#39;s =my.cnf=.

Utilizing transactions under %I% will require a survey of SQL operations in the current code and insertion of appropriate begin/end transaction statements.

---+++ Optimum !MySQL configuration

%I%-specific configuration options used are listed below:&lt;verbatim&gt;[mysqld]
thread_concurrency = 8
set-variable = max_connections=500
log-bin=/test/mysqldb/mysql-bin
innodb_data_home_dir = /test/mysqldb
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:2000M;ibdata2:10M:autoextend
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /test/mysqldb
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2048M
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 20M
innodb_log_file_size = 512M
innodb_log_files_in_group = 2
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M
innodb_file_per_table
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

---+++ Performance tests

Query tests were performed on copies of the ITB data corpus, one of which had been converted to %I% while the other was still %M%.

The tests were executed in the following order:

   1. Q1 %I% Trials 01 - 05;
   2. Q1 %M% Trials 01 - 05;
   3. Q1 %I% Trial 01a;
   4. Q1 %M% Trial 01a;
   5. Q2 %I% Trials 01 - 05;
   6. Q2 %M% Trials 01 - 05;
   7. Q2 %I% Trial 01a;
   8. Q2 %M% Trial 01a;
   9. Q1 %I% Trial 01b;
   10. Q1 %M% Trial 01b;
   11. Q2 %I% Trial 01b;
   12. Q2 %M% Trial 01b.

Notes:

   * Q1 and Q2 refer to query 1 (one week&#39;s worth of job-level data) and query 2 (approx 5 weeks&#39; worth of job-level data) respectively.
   * The times are not entirely static even with the use of the SQL_NO_CACHE directive, which is partly why I did the multiple test runs in the first place.
   * The %I% configuration was optimized specifically to take account of the 6GB memory on the system; the %M% configuration was not.

---++++ Results commentary

   * Despite the request for !MySQL not to cache the results, there is a marked difference in some of the query times, especially for %M%. Speculation is that this is OS or CPU-related caching (memory, file, etc).
   * In general, queries against the large table are a factor of two slower for small queries only. For larger queries, the %M% times blow up, settling down from a factor 20 to a factor 2 slower than the same query under %I% after multiple consecutive queries.
