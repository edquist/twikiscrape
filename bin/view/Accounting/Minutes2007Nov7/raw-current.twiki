---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Status of the Nov 16th release.

Due to a request from our management to review and revalidate all requirements 
from OSG and the computing Division, the move to Innodb is delayed to at least the next release.

---++DB and Schema issues

Chris: I helped Diana work through a few issues with our test database, which appears to
be related to the fact that the current backup copying is not clearing the existing area plus
a few issues with file ownership.

Diana: Not surprisingly,  recovery is more difficult than backup,  and 
the way this software does it is not what I expected and not what I&#39;m 
used to. 

John: I published the new ERD diagram on the TWiki
and I updated Margherita&#39;s work area.

---++Collector

---++Report development

Paul Avery pointed the following weaknesses:

   a. Have the ability to fold the multi graph reports into a single one
   a. Change the default site selected by &quot;Daily Usage By VO For Site.&quot;
   a. Add a &quot;Contact us&quot; link to the bottom of the page
   a. Need for more feedback on which graph is being displayed.

Jeff:
a) has been implemented by letting the user select the number of group by graphs
b) has been fixed.  c) has been implemented. d) is being implemented by using the new frame framework.
See http://gratiax21.fnal.gov:8880/mybirt220/index-frames.html for a preview

Due to bug in the pagination in birt 2.2.1, we need to revert to 2.2.0.

Karthik: I&#39;ve been ill and haven&#39;t done much over the last few days. I also need to speak to Jeff regarding what we can do given the current lack of storage data in the Gratia DB. Jeff also suggested working on non-Dcache reports: will need to discuss that.

Chris: any value in populating a DB with fabricated test data?

Karthik: I think so.

John W: Fabricated data allows for regression testing.

---++Authentication.

Requirements:
   Have login, logout and change roles link.
   logout should make sure we &#39;forget&#39; completely the user certificate.
   login bring a page allowing to select a VO (and hence a VOMS server).
   change roles (and select VO) brings a page allowing to select a role.
