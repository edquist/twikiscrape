---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Gratia sysadmin and operations tasks

Steve: Need some downtime on the production db machine to update the partitioning.

we will purge some of the RawXml records.

Action: 
Philippe and Chris to download old RawXML file and to archived.
Steve: Where to put the RawXML archive for now?
Where to put the long term incoming message (aka raw xml) for long term storage.

---++DB and Schema issues

---++Collector

---++Report development

Jeff: I am done with the conversion of all the report to Birt 2.2.  It needs more testing.  We still have
to iron out a few details on the stored procedure (list of parameters).

Jeff: Working on cleaning up the main OSG reports.  I am not working yet on the osg_daily nor the psacct reports.
For example I am re-adding move over.

Chris: Can we have axis clickeable?

Jeff: I am not sure yet.

Penelope: I added the ability support for default date and time period on the links (set the url param IntervalDays).
The direct url access allow you to receive: pdf, doc or ppt.   However there is a bug in Birt where the PDF creator
ignore the scaling request.

Penelope: IE 7 is broken.  It does not work properly with frame (target=name_frame is ignored after the first click).
Cascading Sheet is also not working.  I found a software that create a tree widget that exhibit the proper behavior
and I solve my communication issue between JSP and JavaScript.   (Return to using Frameset but working nicely
this time).

Chris: For layout one should using the unit &#39;em&#39; (relative) instead of &#39;px&#39; (fixed)

Action:
John: Working on updating build procedure for birt 2.2
Penelope: Working on presentation.
Will tag the reports directories and move over the rptdesign files to production.
