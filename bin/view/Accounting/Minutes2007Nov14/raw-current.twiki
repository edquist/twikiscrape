---++DB and Schema issues

Diana: The backup tool I have been looked at as a terrible documentation and
the backup recovery is a bit hawkward (requires a separate area of the same size
of the data base).

Diana/Chris: CMS db is using Innodb extensive on smaller database.  They currently use
replication as backup technique.  And they are offering __expert__ help as needed

Diana/Chris: So we could also use replication as the hotbackup and do cold backup
of the replica.  

Philippe: Humm given the problem of the for-a-fee backup solution, I think we should
plan on __not__ using it and go the replication route.
