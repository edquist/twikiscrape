---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++DB and Schema issues

Philippe: A future evolution of JobUsageRecord, we plan on replacing Description and SiteName
(and maybe a few others) with a foreign key into a table containing the list of possible values.

Diana: Innodb conversion ... still need more investigation.

John W: Should we change the name of the column MetricRecord.dbid?

---++Collector/Report development

Philippe: I would like to get a list of steps that need to be done to get to the point where
we will receive the DN and Role.  One of those steps is for the admin to enable GRAM
auditing.  How are we going to get it to be enabled everywhere.

Penelope: I have java handler that (in the eclipse enviroment) can pick the information
(database, username, etc) from our code and give it to the birt reports (but they don;t
show up yet in the interface).  You can have many event handler.

---++Probes

Jeff: I am working on reducing the number of rptdesign by a factor 2 (by factoring them 
out).  

Philippe/Chris: In the Summary tables instead of storing voname/reportablevoname we will
store in corrid and create a view that hide this relation.

Chris: I had to fix the Grid field setting in Gratia.py.

---++Storage Probe

Chris: We are agreed to take on the distribution of the DCache probe (in the same way
we are taking on the distribution of the glexec probe).

---++Test Bed

John W: Tied up on vdt 1.7.1.  Discussed with margharita on how to access VOMS.
I have a db backup/restore scripts ready but in the VDT context need to move on.
I update the Twiki with the list of machine and use we have.

John W: I need to get back to lookup/check if the globus dvpt has been done so that
we can access the DN/Role/etc.  

---++Metrics

---++Any Other Business

John U:. Julia A. who is working the CMS dashboard would like to discuss with the Gratia team how to
get accurate information and what kind of information she can access (and how).
