---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

---+Services Operation

Dan: What about the missing redirection.

Philippe: I don&#39;t really know, the code and configuration seems to be the same for the itb and the other.    Our institutional memory on the subject has disappeared (Chris).

Philippe: There is a missing install on the itb collector (urlrewrite) which is on the other collector.   There is not obvious reason for the difference.

Dan: There is probably a bug in the fail-over script.

Philippe: In addition, the reporter should have just worked on that collector anyway.   Indeed there is an exception in the log:

2010-09-29 14:08:39,948 org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].[/gratia-reporting].[jsp](http-80-Processor23) [ERROR]: Servlet.service() for servlet jsp threw exception
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sun.print.CUPSPrinter
   at sun.print.UnixPrintServiceLookup.getDefaultPrintService(UnixPrintServiceLookup.java:503)

which according to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=297910

is due to a problem with the DISPLAY variable.

After a while we found out the problem was because one of the JAVA settings was
incorrect. Something related to display property if I remember it correctly.
My apology that I didn&#39;t close the bug after we discover the real reason of the
issue. I&#39;m sure our network administrator remember all details because he was
the one who discovered the reason. On Monday I will have additional details to
report here and then will close the issue.

Comment 6 Vladimir 2010-02-20 12:41:38 EST

With the &quot;DISPLAY=remote_node:0.0&quot; setting we had the issue.
Changing it to &quot;DISPLAY=:0.0&quot; resolve the issue.

I&#39;m closing the issue but I suggest that the Birt team at least include
description of this situation to FAQ or improve the error message.

---+OSG Issues

ALICE: Any heads up?

Brian: yes they want to use yet another batch system which is reminiscent of SGE, so maybe we can re-use the SGE probe.

Philippe: Fair enough, I will investigate whether it is similar to any existing system.

Brian: In addition they will be using CREAM. 

Philippe: Oh well ; we know it is plausible.

Brian: EGI wants to standardize on the storage usage record.   Brian will be the main contact.

---+WLCG 

---+Developments

Philippe:  I have started work supporting HTPC jobs in PBS and LSF as a side effect we now have a nightly test of PBS and LSF probe that will augmented with HTPC jobs when we know what they look like.  I am currently waiting for input from Purdue, OU (and Nebraska).    

Philippe: No work as been done in the collector.   

---++Probe.

Boinc probe:  Is OSG requesting an adhoc daily or weekly reports on what&#39;s happening in boinc-land?   If yes, what do you want to know.   Note: Can that wait for the pilot jobs reflection to happen? (the answer is probably not).

Brian: The best solution is to use the &#39;Nebraska&#39; display to show off their information (the change is straightforward).

---++Collector and Reports

Karthik: About ready to go back to Gratia work.

Brian: Yes, I have been leveraging Karthik help in other areas.
