---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Gratia sysadmin and operations tasks

All: An unfortunate &quot;group by&quot; included in the Summary view lead MySQL to have to 
create a large on disk temporary table for each report requested leading to the slowness
last week (problem was compounded by the (expected) increase in load due to glexec probes).

Chris: I had to fix a permission problem to let Kathrik access the Gratia MySQL db

Steve: When can we stop off site access to the MySql

Chris: It would be better to enable certificate based access to the db.

Diane: Should we move away from Kits and download directly from MySQL.

---++DB and Schema issues

Chris: The query slowness has been resolved by correcting the view definition.

Chris: About innodb, we must have all table being Innodb (some of the sql commands
issued by Hibernate when a table is using Innodb are not compatible with MyISAM).

Chris: For a large InnoDB database, our status page is extremely slow (because 
InnoDB is slow at executing count(*) due to transaction support).

---++Collector/Report development

Jeff: The latest graph to Comparison for between Gratia and Panda is ready to go.

Chris: I shall upload to the server soon.

Penelope: The Birt developers are finally got back to us.  They have been able to
see the problem but not able to reproduce by themself.  I even install some library
they recommended.

Penelope: In the meantime, I am work around the problem by using a technique
similar to the old implementation so that we can deploy soon.

Philippe: Could we have the beta release of our reporting tools with Birt 2.2 
deployed sometimes next week.

Penelope: I think so.  However it would be quite simplistic.

Philippe: We are at a point where we need to re-evaluate our direction.

Jeff: I would like to point out that we are now familiar with creating report
with Birt and we should be mindful that moving to a tool will be costly in
re-training on developing the reports.
