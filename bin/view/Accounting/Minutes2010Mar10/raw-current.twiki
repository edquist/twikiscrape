---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

---+Services Operation

---++OSG/Fermi

  * Reporting operations are still failed over to gr12xN while awaiting new backplane for gratia13. DB Replication was enabled after rebuild completed but stalled due to a typo in the exclusions for the trace tables. Catch-up has been haphazard and slow for reasons which we hope will go away when the backplane is replaced, but the DBs on gr12x5 and gr13x5 are in sync currently.

---++RSV

---+OSG Issues

---+WLCG 

---+Developments

---++Report Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Extensions(Karthik).

   * All code work for BIGINT upgrade is done, and ready to commit to within testing replication and administration interface.
   * Reports have been tested.
   * Not sure about !TraceID. Can be checked by doing &quot;link&quot; to report and testing it works.
   * Following on from email about HTTPS configuration -- Chris will check with Scot on whether configure_gratia does the right thing to configure the location of the http cert in service-configuration.properties.
   * BIGINT upgrade was very useful for learning about all internal interactions and intricacies.

---++Testing framework (Aaron)

   * Aaron has finished working on the scripts, sent to Scot for comments.
   * Scot sent back comments, have been incorporated and sent back to Scot -- waiting for any further comments.&lt;/li&gt;
   * Aaron will deal with any remaining issues and comments as they arise.&lt;/li&gt;
