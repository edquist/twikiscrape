---++ Discussion
   1.  UNL has requested modification of gratia database schema (see GRATIA-67. GRATIA-66). That will require:
      * modifcation of !ComputeElementRecord and  !MasterSummaryData
      * changes in summirization logic to include requested memory allocation
      * modification of all batch probes to report allocated memory
      * modification of the webtools to display memory graphs
      * modification of email reports (?) &lt;/br&gt;
     Significant part of this work will be done at Nebraska.
     Tanya will need to talk to Ruth in order to clarify gratia development priorities. 
   1. Suchandra is still waiting for Horst to come back from vacation and deal with LSF. Tanya has proposed to collect various log file from the sites that are running LSF and test probes against these logs. Suchandra has agreed to do so.
   1. Gratia reporting rpm is ready and is released to development repo. We are working on documentation. It looks like the queries used to generate reports are overreporting data because there are not filtered by !ResourceType (Batch, !BatchPilot and !GridMonitor). Also both OSG and local Grids are reported as well as data from &quot;Unknown&quot; VO. Tanya will modify it and release a new rpm. It is unclear how many people are really looking at email reports.
   1. John starts  working on https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-65. We will release new gratia service when it is ready
