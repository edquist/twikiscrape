---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Release Status

---++Services Operation

---+++OSG/Fermi

Dan: Chris and I agree that we ought to skip the daily backup of the non-compressed raw-xml which does not buy much.

Chris: Both the input and replication of the transfer collector are cpu bound since the all the CMS transfer data has been &#39;caught up&#39;

---+++RSV

Chris: Thanks to Arvind&#39;s good will, we settle on a good long term support plan for the source code of the RSV Gratia Monitoring probe

---++OSG 

---++WLCG 

John Weigand:

The UFlorida-IHEPA Tier 2 site was decommissioned on 2/14 per Bockjoo Kim (site admin).

So the T2_US_Florida group now consists of   Uflorida-PG and   UFlorida-HPC.

We will continue to report UFlorida_IHEPA through 3/15 due to the &quot;delete/add&quot; nature of our Gratia-APEL interface since we report February data through that period to accommodate late updates.   At that time, we will remove from the configuration file that identifies the sites we report on.

The APEL org_Tier2 table will not be changed.  IFlorida-IHEPA will remain as a member of the T2_US_Florida group so that historical (prior to the decommissioning)  will be visible in the EGEE portal.  This table identifies the APEL OSG data that is transferred to the EGEE accounting portal.  A similar scenario occurred with Purdue-Lear back in August 2008.

I will be notifying APEL support today to determine how we did this.  There is a special table, not visible to us, that allows for the retention of this data on the EGEE portal.  When this is complete UFlorida-IHEPA will not appear as a part of the T2_US_FLORIDA group but will appear as a part of IFlorida-PG site.  I realize this is confusing, as it is to me but this is how it works.


---++Fermi/CD
