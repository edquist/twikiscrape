---++ Description
A request was made on 9/22/11 to publish the ILC VO Gratia accounting data to APEL/EGI.



The Gratia/APEL interface is designed to publish specific data to APEL/WLCG for specific Tier 1/2  Resource Groups and VOs. 

The current list of VOs are: cms, atlas and alice.

Resource Groups:
&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
#--- CMS Tier 1 ----&lt;br/&gt;
USCMS-FNAL-WC1&lt;br/&gt; 
#--- CMS Tier 2 ----&lt;br/&gt;
CIT_CMS_T2&lt;br/&gt;
GLOW&lt;br/&gt;
MIT_CMS&lt;br/&gt;
Nebraska&lt;br/&gt;
Purdue-RCAC&lt;br/&gt;
Purdue-Steele&lt;br/&gt;  
Purdue-Rossmann&lt;br/&gt;
UCSDT2&lt;br/&gt;
SPRACE&lt;br/&gt;         
!GridUNESP_CENTRAL&lt;br/&gt;
UFlorida-HPC&lt;br/&gt;
UFlorida-PG&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
#--- ATLAS Tier 1 ----&lt;br/&gt;
BNL-ATLAS&lt;br/&gt;      
#--- ATLAS Tier 2 ----&lt;br/&gt;
AGLT2&lt;br/&gt;          
HU_ATLAS_Tier2&lt;br/&gt; 
BU_ATLAS_Tier2&lt;br/&gt;
MWT2&lt;br/&gt;
MWT2_UC&lt;br/&gt; 
OU_OCHEP_SWT2&lt;br/&gt;
WT2&lt;br/&gt;
SWT2_CPB&lt;br/&gt;
UTA_SWT2&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
#--- ALICE Tier 2 ----&lt;br/&gt;
NERSC-PDSF&lt;br/&gt;
LC-glcc&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Based on viewing the Gratia data for that VO, it appears ILC users have run jobs on the following Gratia sites from 7/1/11 through 9/22/11:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
+------------------+---------+------------+--------+--------+
| SiteName         | Period  | Sum(NJobs) | SumCPU | SumWCT |
+------------------+---------+------------+--------+--------+
| FNAL_DZEROOSG_2  | 2011-08 |          1 |      0 |      0 |
| FNAL_FERMIGRID   | 2011-08 |          3 |      0 |      0 |
| FNAL_GPGRID_1    | 2011-07 |          3 |      0 |      2 |
| FNAL_GPGRID_1    | 2011-09 |       2030 |    550 |    578 |
| FNAL_GPGRID_3    | 2011-08 |          2 |      0 |      0 |
| LIGO_UWM_NEMO    | 2011-08 |          1 |      0 |      0 |
| MIT_CMS          | 2011-09 |          3 |      0 |      0 |
| RENCI-Engagement | 2011-09 |         54 |      0 |      1 |
| UColorado_HEP    | 2011-09 |         54 |      0 |     14 |
+------------------+---------+------------+--------+--------+
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Keep in mind Gratia site name and !MyOSG resource group/resource are not necessarily the same. For the Gratia site names listed above, these are the resource groups that data would have to be reported for (MIT_CMS is the only one already being reported):

&lt;verbatim&gt;
 Resource Group      Gratia Site(s)
 ----------------    ---------------
 FNAL_FERMIGRID      FNAL_DZEROOSG_2 FNAL_FERMIGRID FNAL_GPGRID_3
 FNAL_GPGRID_1       FNAL_GPGRID_1
 LIGO_UWM_NEMO       LIGO_UWM_NEMO
 RENCI-Engagement    RENCI-Engagement
 UColorado_HEP       UColorado_HEP
 MIT_CMS             MIT_CMS  (already interfaced)
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Another factor in the Gratia/APEL interface is that, in addition to raw CPU and Wall Time,  normalized CPU and Wall Time is a requirement. So, for each Resource Group, a normalization factor (based on HEPSpec06 values) is required.  These can be calculated programmatically for each resource group based on GIP data:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
Resource Group          SI2K   HS06
--------------          ----   ----
FNAL_FERMIGRID          2728  10912
FNAL_GPGRID_1           3233  12932
LIGO_UWM_NEMO           1500   6000
RENCI-Engagement        1285   5140
UColorado_HEP           4925  19700
MIT_CMS                 1873   7492
&lt;/verbatim&gt;


This can all be done with the interface as designed today by just including these new resource groups and the ILC VO to the interface criteria.

__The main question would be__  : What happens to the data once it gets to APEL?

We understand how the Tier 1 and 2 site&#39;s data get used in EGI.  Each of these sites needs to be registered with LCG accounting and an MOU agreement is a part of that agreement.

Is there a registration requirement for these new sites?%BR%
Or can we just send the data and everyone will be happy?

__Another question__ : Is this the complete list of sites that ILC will be running on?

__Reminder__ : Unless otherwise instructed, the interface will still send up only a set of specified VOs.  It can be changed to send all VO data up for the resource groups specified if so desired.
