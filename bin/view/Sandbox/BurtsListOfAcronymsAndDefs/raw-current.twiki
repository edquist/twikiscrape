---+ Acronyms and Definitions
---++ OSG 
   * ACDC: Advanced Computational Datacenter Grid (CCR @ UBuffalo).  Separate from OSG but contributes some tools.
   * [[http://lfield.home.cern.ch/lfield/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?area=bdii&amp;page=documentation][BDII]]: Berkeley Database Information Index: Replacement for GIIS (developed by LCG).  Consists of two LDAP servers.
   * DN: Distinguished Name.  Example: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Burt Holzman 380062
   * GIIS: Grid Index Information Service.  Binds together arbitrary GRISes.
   * GIP: Generic/Grid3 Information Provider: MDS with Glue Schema
   * GIS: Grid Information Service.  Stores information about Grid infrastructure.
   * GLUE: Grid Laboratory Uniform Environment: Schema for resource publication.  Also has an Information Provider component (will be phased out at some point in favor of GIP for Glue).
   * !GridCat: Hand-maintained Grid Catalog for OSG (by Main.BockjooKim?)
   * GRIS: Grid Resource Information Service.  A probe which gathers resource data and publishes it into a GIS.
   * GUMS: Grid User Management Service.  Creates maps from user DN to local account.  Uses information from VOMS.
   * iGoC: Indiana (U.) Grid Operations Center.  Hub for Grid3 and will have OSG Operations Core responsibility (?)
   * MDS: Monitoring and Directory Service.  Globus implementation of a GIS.
   * OSG: Open Science Grid.  Successor to Grid3.
   * PRIMA: PRIvilege Management and Authorization.  Runs locally on gatekeeper and queries GUMS.
   * RP: Resource Provider.  Think of big farms that service many VOs.
   * VO: Virtual Organization.  Mainly experimental collaborations fit here.
   * VOMS: Virtual Organization Membership Server.  Maintains list of users in VOs, their roles, and their certs.
   * VOMRS: VOM Registration Service.   Server for administering VOMS with web-based interfaces.

---++ USCMS
   * CMKIN: Event Generator (Pythia)
   * COBRA
   * [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/UserComputing/Tutorials/Crab.html][CRAB]]: CMS Remote Analysis Builder. Wrapper around LCG submission scripts?
   * DAR
   * !MCRunJob
   * MCPS: Monte Carlo Processing Service.  Python script to simplify MC work from
     event generation to digitization and writing out DSTs.
   * MOP: Montecarlo O.P.?  Given a script, creates DAGs of DAGs of DAGS.  &lt;br&gt;
         General format: !StageIn -&gt; Run -&gt; !StageOut -&gt; !CleanUp&lt;br&gt;
         There is a site_info file with various variables (location of MOP_SCRATCH, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
         A !MatchMaker services uses Condor to match up MOP requests and sites
   * ORCA: Digitization
   * OSCAR: Simulation (GEANT4)
   * SCRAM
