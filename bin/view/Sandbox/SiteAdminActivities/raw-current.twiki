---+++ OSG Support for Resource Adminstrators

The OSG provides support for resource administrators though several mechanisms. This happens in both structured formats such as quarterly face-to-face meetings, online documentation, proactive monitoring and alerts of resource health, and trouble ticketing systems as well as more casual peer group fashions such as peer group mailing lists, a community support center, and open campfire chat sessions. 

Quarterly face-to-face meetings allows a two day meeting format with a half day of plenary talks covering new developments and a day and a half of hands-on and speak with an expert sessions. [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2497][August Meeting Link]]. An online documentation wiki is available for living documents, this provides an environment for Resource Administrators to review and update existing documents to reflex their experiences. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu][TWiki Link]].The OSG Operations Center (GOC) proactively watches and alerts administrators of problems at the local Resource by collecting RSV monitoring results. [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/wizardsummary/index?datasource=summary&amp;summary_attrs_showservice=on&amp;summary_attrs_showrsvstatus=on&amp;summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showfqdn=on&amp;account_type=cumulative_hours&amp;ce_account_type=gip_vo&amp;se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&amp;start_type=7daysago&amp;start_date=05%2F14%2F2009&amp;end_type=now&amp;end_date=05%2F21%2F2009&amp;all_resources=on&amp;gridtype=on&amp;gridtype_1=on&amp;has_status=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;disable_value=1][MyOSG Presentation of RSV results]]. When a problem is reported by the community or as issue detected by monitoring problem tickets are opened and followed up on by the GOC staff. [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/navigator][Currently opened tickets]]. Tickets are also searchable from this mechanism for Administrators that would like to research past trouble tickets.

Casual means of communication and support are also available to OSG Resource Administrators. Several  mailing lists are available to communicate with other Administrators and OSG Experts. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Consortium_Mailing_Lists][Mailing Lists]], these lists encourage peer support. The OSG Community Support Center (CSC) has been put into place for OSG Resources that do not have the effort or expertise to form their own support group, this functions much like the mailing list counting on peers for support but allows extension into formal ticket tracking. [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/wizardsummary/index?datasource=summary&amp;summary_attrs_showdesc=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&amp;gip_status_attrs_showfqdn=on&amp;account_type=cumulative_hours&amp;ce_account_type=gip_vo&amp;se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&amp;start_type=7daysago&amp;start_date=05%2F14%2F2009&amp;end_type=now&amp;end_date=05%2F21%2F2009&amp;sc=on&amp;sc_3=on&amp;gridtype=on&amp;gridtype_1=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;disable_value=1][List of Resources Using CSC for Support]]. The OSG Trash/Trash/Integration Group also runs several campfire chat sessions a week, allowing a place for software questions to be brought up and discussed. [[http://integrationcloud.campfirenow.com/room/192189][Campfire Chat Site]].

There are also several group teleconferences OSG Resource Administrators are welcome to attend. These include:

   * Weekly
      * Operations Meeting [[Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes]]
      * VDT Office Hours [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/office-hours/]]
   * Monthly
      * Site Coordination [[Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/SiteCoordination/WebHome#Meetings]]

---+++ VO Infrastructure for Leverage

The OSG leverages the large VOs for expertise and tools. Much of the integration effort is contributed by the big VOs as well as expertise for OSG Community Support. Trouble ticket exchanges have been worked out to allow the large OSG VOs and peering grids (EGEE) to seamlessly exchange issues. This allows for quick action and no manual communication is necessary.
