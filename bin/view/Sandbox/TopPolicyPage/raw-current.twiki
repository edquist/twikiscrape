---++ Policies
The OSG is working with partners primarily through [[http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj-lcg-security/][JSPG]]
on a set of policies that will allow reliable and interoperable access to resources across different grid infrastructures
around the world. The approved policy documents are listed below.  

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/IncidentDiscoveryReporting][Incident Discovery and Response]] - procedures on reporting suspected security incidents
      * based on the [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=19][Incident Response Plan]]
      * applies to all OSG participants.
   * [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Grid Acceptable Use]] &lt;br&gt; applies to all OSG particpants
   * [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][Service Agreement]] &lt;br&gt; applies to everyone providing a service on OSG
   * [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=676][Site Operations]] &lt;br&gt; applies to all resource providers

There is work in progress on additional policy documents and these may be reviewed [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/PoliciesProcedures][here]].  This consists of a framework detailing the responsibilities and expectations for end users, virtual organizations, resource providers and software developers.
