This is the information in this page for the readiness plan for SRMClientTools

SRM shell-client as an optional module in the OSG cache
==========================================================

1) Package, distribute and support the SRM Shell-tool Clients &quot;SRM-cp&quot;. This toolkit provides a command line interface to the SRM  standard. The package is supported for the standard interfaces to the dCache, DRM and Castor implementations of SRM.

2). The goal is to introduce this component for testing on ITB by May 1st.

3) It is expected that for deployment the SRM V2 interface will be supported.

4) Validation and testing can be done using the LBNL SRM testing tool. We are looking at obtaining access to the LCG-2 SRM testing suites also.

5) Documentation is currently available at http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/index.html . By the time of introducing to the ITB we will have man pages and a user web page for reference.

6) Support for such a component needs a triage structure, since the SRM support group does not have the resources to support diagnosis of the end to end problems that occur in the use of an SRM client&lt;-&gt;SRM server&lt;-&gt;storage service (SE). Our proposal, for discussion, is the following:
    VO support is the first level contact
    SE resource provider is the second level contact
    SRM client package provider is the third level contact - srm-support@fnal.gov.
