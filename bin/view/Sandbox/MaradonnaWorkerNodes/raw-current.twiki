---++ Making Maradona play well on the OSG

Maradona is the software used by the EGEE/gLite WMS to run jobs on a compute element.  It approximately does the following:
   * Download the user&#39;s sandbox (usually, executable script and input data) to the worker node
   * Launch the user&#39;s job
      * Renew the proxy during the job&#39;s lifetime
   * Clean up afterward
   * Return results to the WMS server.

Maradona works on OSG, except it assumes that the initial working directory is not on NFS - while OSG currently has the initial working directory on NFS.  This means that the user&#39;s sandbox (and stdin / stdout) is written to the NFS server.  This can be serious for &quot;bad users&quot;.

We show in this page how to make Maradona change its working directory from the user&#39;s $HOME to $OSG_WN_TMP

---++ gLite Customization

Maradona has several hooks for external scripts, called &quot;customization points&quot;.  We will take advantage of one customization point which is sourced before anything else is done.

To find the customization points, Maradona looks in the GLITE_LOCAL_CUSTOMIZATION_DIR environmental variable.  Edit =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-local-job-environment.conf=, and add the following lines:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
GLITE_LOCAL_COPY_RETRY_FIRST_WAIT=120
GLITE_LOCAL_COPY_RETRY_COUNT=2

# Alter this line for your site:
GLITE_LOCAL_CUSTOMIZATION_DIR=/some/shared/directory
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

The first two lines fix a problem in Maradona which causes it to take an obscene amount of time to reconnect to a WMS in case if the WMS&#39;s GridFTP server is broken.  The second - which you need to alter - will point Maradona to look in a specific directory for customization scripts.

---++ Write your customization scripts

Open the file =$GLITE_LOCAL_CUSTOMIZATION_DIR/cp_1.sh= and add the following contents:

&lt;verbatim&gt;
#!/bin/sh

export MY_WORKDIR=`mktemp -d -p $OSG_WN_TMP glite_wms.XXXXXX`
cd $MY_WORKDIR
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

*NOTE:* mktemp ignores the $OSG_WN_TMP argument if $TMPDIR is already set.  PBS sets this variable to /tmp; consult your batch scheduler documentation.

This directory may get left around after execution (TODO: delete this using =cp_3.sh=), so make sure it&#39;s either on tmpfs, or is regularly cleaned.  The contents of the directory, however, should automatically be removed - leaving on the empty directory, ideally.
