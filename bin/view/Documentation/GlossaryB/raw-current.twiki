   $ best effort (in storage reservation)&lt;a name=&quot;DefsBestEffort&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a local policy at SRMs that attempts to efficiently use scarce resources by making storage space reservations _advisory_; space is only allocated as it is claimed, meaning that the client may need to find new storage dynamically. Normally, the site guarantees some minimum for reservations.

   $ bit file ID&lt;a name=&quot;DefsBitFileId&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: An Enstore-assigned, unique identifier for a data file. 
   $ Bloom filter&lt;a name=&quot;BloomFilter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but false negatives are not. Used in [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsReplicaLocationService][Globus RLS]].
