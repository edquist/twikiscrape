   $ Head Node: This is an inexact term that generally refers to a node in an site cluster through which jobs are submitted. In a simple cluster, the head node is the one on which the gatekeeper and monitoring software are installed. In a more complicated cluster, there may be multiple gatekeepers on different nodes, and other issues, thus &quot;head node&quot; is not well defined. A head node would be networked to a group of worker nodes.

#DefsHrm
#DefsHierarchicalResourceManager
   $ Hierarchical Resource Manager (HRM): An SRM that manages access to both one or more disk caches and one or more tape archiving systems.

#DefsHsm
#DefsHierarchicalStorageManagement
   $ Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM): HSM systems transparently migrate files from more expensive hard disk systems to cheaper optical disk and/or magnetic tape, usually robotically accessible. When a user requests the files, the HSM transparently moves them back to the hard disk system. _See also_ [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Storage_Management][HSM at Wikipedia]].

#DefsHpc
#DefsHighPerformanceComputing
   $ High Performance Computing (HPC): Computing environments that deliver large processing capacity via supercomputers and computer clusters.  It often is used with a narrower meaning of supercomputers in the teraflops (Trillion Floating Operations Per Second) range.

#DefsHtc
#DefsHighThroughputComputing
   $ High Throughput Computing (HTC): Computing environments that deliver large amounts of processing capacity over long periods of time.  The relevant measure is floating point operations per month rather than Floating Operations Per Second (FLOPS). _See_ [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/htc.html][Condor High Throughput Computing]].  HTC is a form of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHpc][High Performance Computing]].

#DefsHtpc
#DefsHighThroughputParallelComputing
   $ High Throughput Parallel Computing (HTPC): HTPC is a computational paradigm for the class of applications where large ensembles (hundreds to thousands) of modestly parallel (4- to ~64- way) jobs are used to solve scientific problems ranging from chemistry, biophysics, weather and flood modeling, to general relativity.

&lt;!--
   $ hot spot _or_ hotspot&lt;a name=&quot;DefsHotSpot&quot;&gt;: (dCache) an event where a single device or file from a particular device is being heavily requested.
--&gt;
#DefsHpc
   $ HPC: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHpc][High Performance Computing]].

#DefsHpss
   $ HPSS: A commercial High Performance Storage System designed to scale beyond a petabyte and be highly reliable.  _See_ [[http://www.hpss-collaboration.org][HPSS Collaboration]].

   $ HRM: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHrm][Hierarchical Resource Manager]].

   $ HSM: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHsm][Hierarchical Storage Manager]].

   $ HTC: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHtc][High Throughput Computing]].

   $ HTPC: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHtpc][High Throughput Parallel Computing]].

#DefsCondor
#DefsHTCondor
   $ HTCondor: HTCondor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs.  Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management.  HTCondor is a grid middleware component developed at UW Madison, packaged and distributed by OSG.  Read more at [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/]]. 

   $ HTCondor-G: HTCondor-G is the Grid management part of HTCondor.   HTCondor-G provides for submitting jobs to multiple, independently managed, local grids.   OSG uses mostly the &quot;gt2&quot; (Globus) type of grid jobs but HTCondor-G can also support many other Grid and cloud protocols.

#DefsHtcondorCE
#DefsCondorCE
   $ HTCondor-CE: A [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGatekeeper][gatekeeper]] implementation based on the HTCondor software.
