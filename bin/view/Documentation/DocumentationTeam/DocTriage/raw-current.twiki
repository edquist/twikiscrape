---+ Document Triage
---+ Introduction
At the beginning of 2010, a quick review was done of all documents in the Documentation and !ReleaseDocumentation Webs in preparation for making improvements in those documents.  Note that all of these judgments were made very quickly (&lt; 2 min per document for everything) so they are not necessarily correct.  The area owners may update this information as they see fit.

---++ Triage Tables				
The overall results of this review can be found in DocTriageAll.  In addition, a triage document was created for each area owner that lists documents in their area that are in the Documentation.WebHome and ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome webs as well as other webs (like the associated team web).  This is intended for review by the owners of various areas of documentation to review their documents and also identify possible information in the team area that should be in our official documentation.  (For example, in the case of storage, there were several documents in the team area that are candidates for ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome, including documentation under development.) These documents show the result of the triage and also include a attached spreadsheet with identical information that is useful for updating the table.  The updates can be put in the spreadsheet that automatically produces the TWiki table that can be copied and pasted into the TWiki document.  (This is much easier than editing the TWiki table directly.)  The &quot;Search for Documents&quot; was used to get the list of documents for that area (outside the Documentation and !ReleaseDocumentation Webs) and can be used if you want to update the list to the latest.

---++ How to use the Spreadsheet to Update the TWiki Table
   1 Open the attached spreadsheet
   1 Update the table (columns A though O) Note: If you have both the TWiki page and spreadsheet open at once, the TWiki table has links to all the pages.
   1 Save and Upload the updated spreadsheet.
   1 Copy all the rows (columns P through AD) from the spreadsheet
   1 Edit the TWiki page and Paste over the existing table and save the page
   1 The TWiki page should now look like the spreadsheet
%NOTE% You can also copy a TWiki table (from the normal view mode) and paste it into an Excel spreadsheet.  For Internet Explorer and Safari browsers, you can simply paste into the spreadsheet.  If you use the Firefox browser paste it by doing a Edit-&gt;Paste Special and selecting As: Unicode Text.
