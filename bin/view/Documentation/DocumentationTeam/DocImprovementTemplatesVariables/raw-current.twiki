---+ Workshop Templates and Variables
Standards, Templates, Formatting, Variables Presentation for the Document Improvement Workshop.
%SLIDESHOWSTART%
---++ Introduction
   * All information for people doing documentation is in Documentation.DocHowTo
   * This will cover the Document Formatting Section
   * We liberally used existing guidelines

---++ Rules for topics
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+ *&lt;nop&gt;Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!  If you want to spell out a title whose TWiki name has abbreviations, do that.
   * All level two sections should be in title case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the Installation=
   * All sections (level three and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---+++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * Exclude from the TOC all sections level three and below (=---+++=, =---++++=, etc.).  To accomplish this,  use !%TOC{depth=&quot;2&quot;}% to produce the table of contents.

---++ Composite Documents and Templates
   * [[Documentation.DocExampleMainTopic]] for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocFormattingRules#Compose_Documents_using_Includes][About Includes and  Composite Documents]]
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Here is the !WebTopicEditTemplate (now Trash.ReleaseDocumentationDocInstallTemplate) for newly created pages in this twiki, which are assumed to be included in other topics.

---++ Screen View
Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:

For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a &quot;screen&quot; view:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
command 1
command 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
which looks like:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
command 1
command 2
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a &quot;file&quot; view:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
line 1
line 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
which looks like:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
line 1
line 2
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Variables
See WebPreferences for settings of the following variables.

   * OSG release variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;OSG_VERSION%* = %OSG_VERSION%
   * ITB release variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;ITB_VERSION%* = %ITB_VERSION%
   * VDT release variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_VERSION%* = %VDT_VERSION%
   * Release variable, according to cache (ITB or OSG): *%&lt;nop&gt;VERSION%* = %VERSION%
   * VDT cache variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_CACHE%* = %VDT_CACHE%
   * ITB/OSG cache/grid variable: *%&lt;nop&gt;CACHE%* = %CACHE%
      * Use the  *%&lt;nop&gt;CACHE%* variable as a generic reference for either &quot;ITB&quot; or &quot;OSG&quot; *caches*, *grids*, etc.  It automatically expands to &quot;ITB&quot; if its in the Trash/Trash/Integration web, or to &quot;OSG&quot; if its in the production release documentation web.
   * Refer to the cache/version combination that you&#39;re using, e.g, %CACHE% %VERSION%, with a space in between, as %BR% %BLUE% %&lt;nop&gt;CACHE% %&lt;nop&gt;VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%
   * Full URL to base of VDT Documentation for current release *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_DOCS_URL%*: %VDT_DOCS_URL%
   * Full URL to VDT Cache for this release: *%&lt;nop&gt;VDT_CACHE_URL%*: %VDT_CACHE_URL%
   * Full URL to OSG Cache (ITB or Production) for this release *%&lt;nop&gt;OSG_CACHE_URL%*: %OSG_CACHE_URL%
   * Pacman version: *%&lt;nop&gt;PACMAN_VERSION%*: %PACMAN_VERSION%
