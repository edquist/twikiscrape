We&#39;d like to provide multiple access paths to the same documents. The main one is the !SysAdmin view main path. The _Additional navigation_ provides links to the blocks or subtrees of the !SysAdmin view main path. &quot;* ...&quot; is used sometime instead of repeating the same subitems of a branch.
This is purely a navigation page. Relevant existing documents will have to be identified, assigned in the &quot;buckets&quot; of the sysadmin view main path and will automatically be in the alternate paths. The elements in the alternate view are references to a leaf or a subtree of the sysadmin view main path.
Each leaf is a pointer to a set of (one or more) documents.
A tree like structure would be ideal for this navigation structure.

Some comments:
   * There is little or no documentation about central services. The links in the navigation should be considered placeholders, not trigger a big documentation effort. If there is no documentation, explain how to get the information, e.g. &quot;Send an email to Rob Quick&quot;.
   * Organization &quot;by activity&quot; or &quot;by item&quot; is a matter of personal preference. Current documents are more &quot;by document&quot; oriented.
