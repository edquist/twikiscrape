         * Three more documents were released this week.  This leaves two documents left for review.  The two documents are in relation to grid certificates and we are looking to see if we should just merge the information into other existing documents.  Many of the documents have now gone through testing.  There are the above 2 docs left for review and 2 docs left for testing.  Anand should be able to get the testing done first thing next week.
