---+ Agenda

---++ Change in Project Lead

   * Robert leaves OSG on Friday 09/30/2011
   * Jim will become new project lead on Monday 10/03/2011

---++ Document Migration

   * from !ReleaseDocumentation to Documentation/Release3
   * Note that there are few documents in [[Documentation/Release3.WebTopicList][Release3.WebTopicList]] so there are no overlapping names
   * Some documents shouldn&#39;t be moved:
      * All whose name contains .*OSG1.* (Release notes from prior releases)
      * All whose name begins with Pacman.*  (or maybe not since there are still a few packages installed with Pacman)
      * All whose name contains .*Comments.* (Used for capturing ITB testing results for OSG 1.0 and 1.2)
      * All whose name contains .*Release.* (Mostly release notes or info on packages in prior releases)
      * All whose name begins with Nav.*  (Navigation pages are already in Release3)
      * All whose name contains .*Validation.* (Validation of previous releases)
      * All whose name contains .*Vomrs.* (Not provided in Release3)
      * !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationActionItemsGC2010
      * !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationReviewStatus
   * What about the parent directory/documents?
   * Thoughts from Alain
      1 Tell everyone not to edit the documentation for a few hours.
      1 Move all the documentation to the Release3 web. Make sure to have an &quot;index&quot; file similar to Documentation.RPMTempDocuments
      1 Trim Documentation.RPMTempDocuments so it points at the new index file.
      1 Tell everyone they can edit again.
---++ The Plan 
   1 Jim will move the documents indexed by Documentation.RPMTempDocuments to Release3 over the next week (by Fri, Sept. 30).  Some will be renamed as appropriate but the index will remain valid so anyone on the software team will be able to find them and evolve in the meantime or after the move.  The owners of those documents will be responsible for integrating additional information copied from the !ReleaseDocumentation web install documents which will not be moved to Release3.  (Or if the owner wants to copy the current document and update it with the RPM changes, he/she can do that.)
   1 Jim and Robert will tag documents in !ReleaseDocumentation that can be moved with no changes.  After that list is reviewed by the software team, GOC will mass move those to Release3.
   1 Documents in !ReleaseDocumentation requiring minor change (e.g. VDT_LOCATION) will be identified and the owners of those documents will have to copy them to Release3.
   1 The list of all owners will be created by Robert and Jim.  They will go through the list of owners and verify/change to correct owners where known.  The remaining documents/owners will be distributed to Alain (or the software team) for update.
