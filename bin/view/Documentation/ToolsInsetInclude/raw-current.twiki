%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

This topic is for including another topic but set the included text into a textbox. It allows us to send one set of parameters without having to rewrite the div.

---+++ To include a non-glossary topic in a box
Call this topic with _section=&quot;NonGlossary&quot;_ defined. You may pass a regex pattern; however, you cannot pass certain things such as more than one space or a new line character.

&lt;pre&gt;
%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{ &quot;%WEB%.%TOPIC%&quot; section=&quot;NonGlossary&quot; INCLUDETOPIC=&quot;ItsWeb.TopicName&quot; INCLUDESECTION=&quot;Section&quot; INCLUDEPATTERN=&quot;SomeRegex&quot; ParamOne=&quot;First Passed Parameter&quot; ParamTwo=&quot;Second Passed Parameter&quot; }%
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example if you are trying to include the topic !AboutStorageAreaOsgApp in the Trash/ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050 subweb, which has no defined sections and needs no passed parameters:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nop&gt;%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{ &quot;&lt;nop&gt;%WEB%.%TOPIC%&quot; section=&quot;NonGlossary&quot; INCLUDETOPIC=&quot;Integration.ITB_0_5.AboutStorageAreaOsgApp&quot; }%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ To include a single glossary entry in a box
Call this topic with INCLUDETOPIC is &quot;GlossaryX&quot; (where &quot;X&quot; is the associated starting letter for your term) and _section=&quot;GlossaryTerm&quot;_. 
&lt;pre&gt;
%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{ &quot;%WEB%.%TOPIC%&quot; section=&quot;GlossaryTerm&quot; INCLUDETOPIC=&quot;&lt;nop&gt;Documentation.GlossaryLETTER&quot; TERM=&quot;Full Term With No Ending Space&quot; }%
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example to include the glossary entry for _Hiarchical Storage Manager_:
&lt;pre&gt;
%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{ &quot;&lt;nop&gt;%WEB%.%TOPIC%&quot; section=&quot;GlossaryTerm&quot; INCLUDETOPIC=&quot;&lt;nop&gt;Documentation.GlossaryH&quot; TERM=&quot;Hiarchical Storage Manager&quot; }%
&lt;/pre&gt;


---+++ To include a single glossary entry with no box:
This just includes a glossary term. It&#39;s easier than trying to remember that whole regex pattern every time you use it.
&lt;pre&gt;
%&lt;nop&gt;INCLUDE{ &quot;&lt;nop&gt;%WEB%.%TOPIC%&quot; section=&quot;GlossaryTermNoBox&quot; INCLUDETOPIC=&quot;&lt;nop&gt;Documentation.GlossaryH&quot; TERM=&quot;Hiarchical Storage Manager&quot; }%
&lt;/pre&gt;


---+++ To put some text into a text box:
This method allows you to put any text into a text box. I&#39;ve placed these variables in the Documentation.WebPreferences for this web. Hopefully, we&#39;ll get to the Main web soon.
&lt;verbatim&gt;
%STARTInsetBox%
Place some text that you want here.

You can even %INCLUDE{ &quot;SomeTopic&quot; }% other topics.

You can do anything that you want, as long as you close out all tags.
%ENDInsetBox%
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

This renders like this:
%STARTInsetBox%
Place some text that you want here.

You can do anything that you want, as long as you close out all tags.
%ENDInsetBox%


---++ Sample and Usable Sections
   * Page variables when opened directly, rather than through an INCLUDE:
      * Set INCLUDETOPIC = GlossaryH
      * Set INCLUDEPATTERN =
      * Set TERM = Hierarchical Resource Manager
      * Set INCLUDESECTION = 
      * Set ParamOne = 
      * Set ParamTwo = 
      * Set INCLUDETEXT = This is some text to include. Use this method when you don&#39;t have access to WebPreferences to create the !STARTInsetBox and !ENDInsetBox variables.
   * INCLUDETOPIC = %INCLUDETOPIC%
   * INCLUDEPATTERN = %INCLUDEPATTERN%
   * INCLUDESECTION = %INCLUDESECTION%
   * ParamOne = %ParamOne%
   * ParamTwo = %ParamTwo%
