This page documents installing or upgrading *perfSONAR* for WLCG/OSG Sites.  In case this is the first time you&#39;re trying to install and integrate your perfSONAR into WLCG or OSG, please consult https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Trash/Trash/IntegrationPS

For any questions or help with WLCG perfSONAR setup, please email =wlcg-perfsonar-support &#39;at&#39; cern.ch= or open GGUS ticket for [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS:WLCG_perfSONAR_FAQ][WLCG perfSONAR Monitoring Support Unit]]. We strongly recommend anyone maintaining/using perfSONAR to join https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-user and https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-announce

The current baseline version for WLCG/OSG is perfSONAR 3.5, we recommend all sites to reinstall. If you have already upgraded to 3.5.x, you still need to *re-configure your instances*, please see [[#ConfigMethod][Choosing Configuration Method]].


---++ Installing perfSONAR

The following is step by step guide to install perfSONAR 3.5.x for WLCG and OSG. For general troubleshooting please go [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/TroubleFAQPS][here]], in case you have any questions please email =wlcg-perfsonar-support &#39;at&#39; cern.ch= or open GGUS ticket for [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS:WLCG_perfSONAR_FAQ][WLCG perfSONAR support unit]]. For OSG sites that don&#39;t participate in WLCG, please contact [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/WebHome][OSG operations]]. 


---+++ Installation
   * For sites using perfSONAR Net Install - please follow http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_centos_netinstall.html#step-by-step-guide
   * For sites using perfSONAR Full Install - please follow http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_centos_fullinstall.html#step-by-step-guide
   * For general configuration of perfSONAR - please follow http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_config_first_time.html

Here are some notes about some items to note when installing/updating to v3.5.x
   * When following the installation instructions, the first screen appearing asks about which NIC to use (assuming you host has more than one).  This screen is not shown in the documentation.  Just pick the appropriate one for your system
   * After completing the installation, perfSONAR 3.5 will require you to setup a non-root admin user for the web interface.  If you update instead of a new install things behave differently.  Please read the release notes at  http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_update.html#special-upgrade-notes 
   * In v3.5 =yum= auto-updates are turned on by default.  *We strongly recommend keeping them turned on*.    With =yum= auto-updates in place there is a possibility that updated packages can &quot;break&quot; your perfSONAR install but this is viewed an acceptable risk in order to have security updates quickly applied on perfSONAR instances.
   * NOTE: Version 3.5.1 has made changes to use FHS paths.   If you have scripts or provisioning systems in place they may require updates to match the new locations of configuration and executable files.

#ConfigMethod
---+++ Choosing Configuration Method

For sites participating in WLCG (including OSG sites also in OSG), please follow [[#WlcgConfig][WLCG specific configuration]], for all the others please follow [[#OsgConfig][OSG specific configuration]]. Please avoid following both guides, they&#39;re mutually exclusive.

#WlcgConfig
---+++ WLCG Configuration
 
   7.  First, please ensure your perfSONARs are *registered* either in [[RegisterPSinOIM][OIM]] or in [[PerfSONARInGOCDB][GOCDB]] (service types to use are net.perfSONAR.Bandwidth, net.perfSONAR.Latency). Please note, that only registered perfSONARs will be able to use the new mesh configuration system.
      * Once you are registered you need to contact the appropriate mesh-admin(s) for meshes you wish to join.  See the contacts on the WLCG Network and Transfer Metrics Working Group wiki at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/NetworkTransferMetrics#Members   The mesh-admin must add your site to any meshes you want to participate in.
   1. We recommend all sites to stop NDT/NPAD on your instances
      * You can disable NDT and NPAD by issuing the following commands:
      * &lt;verbatim&gt;
$ service ndt stop
$ service npad stop
$ chkconfig ndt off
$ chkconfig npad off
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
      * Sites who choose to continue to run should be aware that this can pose security issues in certain circumstances and at some in the future point we may recommend a stock kernel be installed, which will &quot;break&quot; NDT/NPAD as they are now.
   1. Increase the available ports for _powstream_ by adding the  following stanza to */etc/perfsonar/regulartesting.conf* (*NOTE:* This was added May 14, 2015, please check you have this in place)
      * &lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;default_parameters&gt;
    type     powstream
    receive_port_range    8760-9960
&lt;/default_parameters&gt;
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
      * NOTE: Even though the /etc/perfsonar/regulartesting.conf file is updated by the mesh-configuration daily, the *default_parameters* stanza will be preserved.
   1. The NTP configuration works out of the box *but* it is better to include good local NTP servers in your configuration.
   2. Make sure to configure all the [[PSAdminInfo][administrative information]] for your perfSONAR installation.
      * Adding communities is optional, but we recommend putting in WLCG as well as your VO: =ATLAS=, =CMS=, etc.   This just helps others from the community lookup your instances in the lookup service.
   3. Please configure your mesh URL(s) in */etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf*.  We have a new =auto-mesh= capability now and all sites should set:
      * Set this to =https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/pfmesh/mine/hostname/&amp;lt;FQDN&amp;gt;=    Replace =&amp;lt;FQDN&amp;gt;= with the fully qualified domain name of your host, e.g., =psum01.aglt2.org=.  
      * &lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;mesh&gt;
      configuration_url https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/pfmesh/mine/hostname/psum01.aglt2.org
      validate_certificate 0
      required 1
&lt;/mesh&gt;
# Replace the following with suitable values for your installation
address   psum01.aglt2.org
admin_email    smckee@umich.edu
skip_redundant_tests   1
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
      * Please REMOVE any old mesh configuration
      * Check manually configured tests to see if they are still needed
      * To verify your configuration, run (as &#39;root&#39;) =sudo -u perfsonar /usr/lib/perfsonar/bin/generate_configuration=.     This will also be run via cron daily to keep your configuration up to date.  
      * See [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/InstallUpdatePS#NoteOnBandwidthMesh][NOTE]] below on the WLCG configuration for the full bandwidth mesh.    We don&#39;t yet have a good solution for how best to configure it given the size of our deployment.
   4. *Security configuration*. Some sites are concerned about having port 80 and/or 443 open.  The working group would like to emphasize that these ports provide access to the perfSONAR web interface and are very useful to users and network administrators.   *Our recommendation is to keep them open*, but for sites with strong concerns we have some rules documented below to customize  iptables to block ports 80 and 443.  It is *required* that either port 80 or port 443 be accessible from the WLCG monitoring subnets shown below:
      &lt;verbatim&gt;
# Allow HTTP/HTTPS only from our monitoring subnets and your site&#39;s subnets 
# Replace &lt;LOCAL_SUBNET&gt; with your site subnet/netmask, e.g. 193.87.10.0/255.255.255.0 or 193.87.10.0/24
# OSG monitoring subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s 129.79.53.0/24 -j ACCEPT
# CERN subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s 137.138.0.0/17 -j ACCEPT
# Infrastructure monitoring (hosted at AGLT2)
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s 192.41.231.110/32 -j ACCEPT
# Replace &lt;LOCAL_SUBNET&gt; appropriately to allow access from your local systems
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s &lt;LOCAL_SUBNET&gt; -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REJECT

#OSG monitoring subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s 129.79.53.0/24 -j ACCEPT
# CERN subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s 137.138.0.0/17 -j ACCEPT
# Infrastructure monitoring (hosted at AGLT2)
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.41.231.110/32 -j ACCEPT
# Replace &lt;LOCAL_SUBNET&gt; appropriately to allow access from your local systems
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s &lt;LOCAL_SUBNET&gt; -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT


/sbin/service iptables save
   &lt;/verbatim&gt;
   5. In case you have *central/campus firewall*, please ensure the following ports are opened on it for all your perfSONAR hosts:
   &lt;verbatim&gt;
# General purpose ports needed to do perfSONAR measurements
ICMP/type 255, 
NTP UDP port:123, 
TRACEROUTE/PING UDP ports: 33434-33634
OWAMP TCP port:861, UDP ports: 8760-9960
BWCTL TCP ports: 4823, 6001-6200, 5000-5900  UDP ports: 6001-6200, 5000-5900 

# HTTP and/or HTTPS ports are needed to access your perfSONAR web interface 
# and the measurement archive and to check availability of your instances by the infrastructure monitoring
# At a minimum either port 80 or 443 *must* be open to the WLCG monitoring subnets.  
# Our recommendation is to have either HTTP or HTTPS open to allow users and network admins access to the perfSONAR web.
HTTP/HTTPS ports 80,443 - open to ALL or at least for the following
source subnets OSG_NET (129.79.53.0/24), AGLT2_NET (192.41.231.110/32) and CERN_NET (137.138.0.0/17)
   &lt;/verbatim&gt;
   6. We *strongly recommend* configuring perfSONAR in *dual-stack mode* (both IPv4 and IPv6) 
      * In case your site has IPv6 support, the only necessary step is to get both A and AAAA records for your perfSONAR DNS names (as well as ensuring the reverse is in place).
      * All existing meshes will support both IPv4 and IPv6 testing.  Sites with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses testing to sites that also have both will run *two* tests.   A side effect of this is that as more sites provide IPv6 addresses, the amount of testing will increase.  
      * At some future point when most sites have IPv6, we may need to adjust the testing frequency to reduce the overall amount of testing
      * For more information on IPv6 see http://ipv6.web.cern.ch/

#NoteOnBandwidthMesh
*NOTE:*   The WLCG Network and Transfer Metrics Working Group (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/NetworkTransferMetrics) is responsible for creating and maintaining the mesh-configurations used in WLCG.   As of March 2016 we know the &quot;Bandwidth tests between all WLCG hosts Dashboard&quot; is not very functional.   We have too many hosts to run a full-mesh of bandwidth tests at short (~&lt; 1 day) cadence.    For now we have setup testing on a 28 day interval but this has exposed a shortcoming in the default perfSONAR toolkit.    Each day maintenance scripts restart all services and this interferes with tests running on intervals &gt; 24 hours.    We (the working group) welcome feedback on how best to implement bandwidth tests amongst WLCG sites.

#OsgConfig
---+++ OSG Configuration
   * First, please ensure your perfSONARs are registered in [[RegisterPSinOIM][OIM]]  (service types to use are net.perfSONAR.Bandwidth, net.perfSONAR.Latency)
      * Once you are registered your instance(s) can be added to the OSG or Tier-3 meshes.  You need to open a ticket with OSG support indicating which mesh(es) you want to join.
   * We are working on OSG specific meshes but they are net ready yet.  Even so sites should use the following *auto-mesh* URL in  */etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf* so they will automatically get OSG specific meshes when ready.
      * Set this to =http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/pfmesh/mine/hostname/&amp;lt;FQDN&amp;gt;=    Replace =&amp;lt;FQDN&amp;gt;= with the fully qualified domain name of your host, e.g., =psum01.aglt2.org=
      * &lt;verbatim&gt;
&lt;mesh&gt;
      configuration_url https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/pfmesh/mine/hostname/psum01.aglt2.org
      validate_certificate 0

# Replace the following with suitable values for your installation
address   psum01.aglt2.org
admin_email    smckee@umich.edu
skip_redundant_tests   1
&lt;/verbatim&gt;
      * To force an immediate configuration, run (as &#39;root&#39;) =sudo -u perfsonar /usr/libr/perfsonar/bin/generate_configuration=. 
   * Increase the available ports for _powstream_ by adding the  following stanza to */etc/perfsonar/regulartesting.conf* (*NOTE:* This was added May 14, 2015, please check you have this in place)
      * &lt;verbatim&gt;

#UpgradeGuide  
---++ Upgrading perfSONAR

Before updating, please read the release notes at  http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_update.html#special-upgrade-notes 

To update please run the following:
&lt;verbatim&gt;
# yum clean all
# yum update
# reboot
&lt;/verbatim&gt; 

With version 3.5.1, the locations of files were normalized to FHS paths.  Please check any custom scripts or configuration management tools you may use to see if the need updates.   See new locations at http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/3.5.1/config_files.html 

Note, it&#39;s *very important to reboot* otherwise your update is incomplete.    Please also note, that from v3.4 =yum= auto-updates are turned on by default.  *We strongly recommend keeping them turned on*.    With =yum= auto-updates in place there is a possibility that updated packages can &quot;break&quot; your perfSONAR install but this is viewed an acceptable risk in order to have security updates quickly applied on perfSONAR instances.

If you haven&#39;t yet added another (=non-root=) user to administer the web interface, you should run =/usr/lib/perfsonar/scripts/nptoolkit-configure.py= and do so, as suggested in =motd=. See http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_users.html for detailed instructions.

Please backup your old =/etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf= file and replace it with =/etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf.rpmnew=.

Then please reconfigure your boxes following either [[#WlcgConfig][WLCG Configuration]] or [[#OsgConfig][OSG Configuration]]. If unsure about which method to follow, please check [[#ConfigMethod][Choosing Configuration Method]]. For any further questions, please consult [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/TroubleFAQPS][Troubleshooting]] pages, perfSONAR documentation (http://docs.perfsonar.net) or contact directly WLCG or OSG perfSONAR support units.
