---++ Document Tester Responsibilities
%INCLUDE{Documentation.DocTesterResponsibilities}%

---++ Tracking Documents that You Test
There are a set of TWiki variables (command like) that will create tables on your home page (typically !Main.FirstLast) that will list documents for which you are the Owner, Reviewer, or Tester.  Variables also exist for Area owners of documentation.

---+++ How to set up your own Home Page
   =The Twiki Variables= developed as part of the Content Management Project are available for every user to set up their Home Pages in a way that suits them best.  Your home page is your TWiki user name, usually !FirstLast, and can be viewed and edited by going to !Main.FirstLast.  Or go to the TWiki main page, and enter your TWiki name in the url in place of !ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome.

   Document Tables can be generated for all documents you have a role in by including table queries placed in your home page.  The queries in the next sections pick up the OWNER variable from your home page. Include the following HTML comment at the beginning of your home page:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;verbatim&gt;&lt;!-- CONTENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT
   * Local OWNER = &lt;FirstLast&gt;
--&gt;&lt;/verbatim&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Include a Table of Documents that I have been asked to Test
   Search all documents that have been assigned to you for review:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
%%NOP%QUERY_TESTER_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS_CLOSED%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_TESTER%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
&lt;/pre&gt;
