---++ Useful Writer Advice and Document Standards
Before you write a new document, be sure to read [[Documentation.DocWriterAdvice][advice for writers]] that has proven useful for writing in general and for OSG documents in particular.

Document owners should be familiar with the [[Documentation.DocClassifications#DocumentTypes][Document Templates]] that specify sections that are recommended in various documents.  In addition, an owner should be familiar with special TWiki variables that make it easy to produce both easy and consistent document formatting that is covered in [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules][Formatting Rules]].

---++ Tracking Documents that You Own
There are a set of TWiki variables (command like) that will create tables on your home page (typically !Main.FirstLast) that will list documents for which you are the Owner, Reviewer, or Tester.  Variables also exist for Area owners of documentation.

---+++ How to set up your own Home Page
=The Twiki Variables= developed as part of the Content Management Project are available for every user to set up their Home Pages in a way that suits them best.  Your home page is your TWiki user name, usually !FirstLast, and can be viewed and edited by going to !Main.FirstLast.  Or go to the TWiki main page, and enter your TWiki name in the url in place of !ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome.

Document Tables can be generated for all documents you have a role in by including table queries placed in your home page.  The queries in the next sections pick up the OWNER variable from your home page. Include the following HTML comment at the beginning of your home page:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;verbatim&gt;&lt;!-- CONTENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT
   * Local OWNER = &lt;FirstLast&gt;
--&gt;&lt;/verbatim&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Include a Table of Documents that I Own
Search all documents that have been assigned to you:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS_CLOSED%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Get email notification of Comments/Changes
You can also set up email notification (maximum 1 email per day) when a selected document or set of documents is changed.  This includes changes resulting from someone making a comment on the page.  This is done by editing the ReleaseDocumentation.WebNotify page to include your TWiki name (assuming your email address is on your home page) and a list of documents that you are interested in.  The basic format is:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
   * Main.FirstLast: Document1 Sample*
&lt;/pre&gt;
where Document1 and Sample* (all documents beginning with Sample) are included.  The complete description of options for specifying your name/email and the list of documents is in ReleaseDocumentation.WebNotify.
