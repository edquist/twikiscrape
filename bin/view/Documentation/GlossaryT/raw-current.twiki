   $ Temporary file: A file in temporary storage.

   $ Temporary storage (space): A shared space that is allocated to a user, but can be reclaimed by the file system (after some guaranteed amount of time has passed). If space is reclaimed, all the files in that space are removed by the file system. The implication is that files in these spaces are also temporary.

   $ !TeraGrid: An open scientific discovery infrastructure, launched by the National Science Foundation in August 2001, and now combining leadership class resources at eleven partner sites to create an integrated, persistent computational resource.  !TeraGrid integrates high-performance computers, data resources and tools, and high-end experimental facilities around the country.  _See_ https://www.teragrid.org/web/about/.

   $ Tier 0: Initial tier in the grid hierarchy for a research project; it is the site at which raw data is taken. The experimental online system interfaces to the tier 0 resources. For the LHC high energy physics experiments, CERN is the tier 0 facility. Fermilab is the tier 0 facility for the Run II experiments at the Tevatron.

   $ Tier 1: Next tier, after tier 0, in grid hierarchy. Tier 1 sites are connected to a Tier 0 site based on an MOU with the Tier 0 site. Typically a tier 1 site offers storage, analysis, and services, and represents a broad constituency (e.g., there may be a single tier 1 site per country or region which connects with multiple tier 2 sites in that country or region). In the US, tier 1 centers for the LHC high energy physics experiments ATLAS and CMS are BNL and Fermilab, respectively.

   $ Tier 2: Tier 2 is the next level down in the grid hierarchy of sites, after tier 1. Tier 2 sites are typically regional computing facilities at University institutions providing a distributed Grid of facilities.

   $ Tier 3: Tier 3 is typically a small to medium IT cluster/grid resource targeted at supporting a small group of scientists.

   $ Tools: With respect to grid computing, &quot;tools&quot; refers to a &quot;layer&quot; of grid components (underneath applications, and above middleware and fabric). The tools layer encompasses resource brokers, monitoring tools, debuggers, etc.

   $ Transfer File Name (TFN): The IP address of a file, containing the transfer protocol name, the host and the Logical File Name ([[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsLfn][LFN]]).

#DefsTrm
   $ TRM: A Tape Resource Manager (TRM) is a middleware layer that interfaces to systems that manage robotic tapes in a data grid. TRM is one type of a Storage Resource Manager ([[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsSrm][SRM]]).

#DefsTurl
   $ TURL: A Transfer URL (TURL) is a URL used in the file transfer negotiation. A TURL includes the transfer protocol name and the name of the file server machine along with the path to the file.

&lt;!--
   $ tags&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTags&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: _Also_ tag files. Pnfs uses tag in the /pnfs namespace to specify file-specific configuration information. Encp transfers this information to Enstore. Tags are associated with directories in the /pnfs namespace, not with any specific file, and thus apply to all files within a given directory. 
   $ Tape Resource Manager&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTapeResourceManager&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: An SRM that manages access to a tape archiving system. _See also:_ DRM; SRM; HRM.
   $ Tape Storage Systems&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTapeStorageSystems&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Tertiary storage of magnetic media.
   $ tertiary storage&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTertiaryStorage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;A computer storage system consisting of one or more storage drives and an automatic media library, for example a tape library or optical disc jukebox. Tertiary storage is used for archival of rarely accessed information, since it is much slower than secondary storage....&quot; [From [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_storage][Wikipedia]])
   $ Tertiary Storage Manager (TSM)&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTertiaryStorageManager&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: *TBD*
   $ third-party transfer (in [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGridFtp][GridFTP]]&lt;a name=&quot;DefsThirdPartyTransfer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a controller for a data transfer in &lt;nop&gt;GridFTP that is neither the source nor destination servers for the data. 
   $ ticket&lt;a href=&quot;DefsTicket&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: an electronic token given to a client application so that a user may claim storage space allocated to him or her.
   $ transfer URL (TURL)&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTransferUrl&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: physical location of file returned to local SRM during file transfers to local site from Grid storage element.
   $ TRM&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTrm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: _See_ Tape Resource Manager.
   $ TURL (or _tURL_)&lt;a name=&quot;DefsTurl&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsTransferUrl][transfer URL]].
