The batch systems (also called job managers) supported by the OSG-CE software are listed in [[ReleaseDocumentation/PreparingComputeElement][Preparing Compute Element]].

OSG does not provide documentation on the individual batch systems; you must install your chosen system separately according to its instructions.  The CE install guide does provide instructions to interface the batch system with the CE software, for each system, as needed.

In addition, since Condor is a popular choice, we have generated some hints on how best to get it to work with the OSG CE.  See [[ReleaseDocumentation/CondorBatchSystemHints][Condor Batch System Hints]] and [[ReleaseDocumentation/MinimalCondorHints][&quot;Minimal Condor&quot; Hints]].
