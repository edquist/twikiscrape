---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% *Welcome to OSG Networking!*  This is the entry point for those interested in Networking in OSG or for those OSG users experiencing network problems.  It provides an overview of the networking goals, plans and various activities and subtopics underway regarding networking in the Open Science Grid.  This area for OSG started in June 2012 and initially focused on network monitoring.  Monitoring is critical to provide needed visibility into existing networks and site connectivity.  OSG is working to provide needed networking information and tools for OSG users, sites and VOs.  

Users with network issues should check the [[NetworkingTroubleShooting][troubleshooting link]] below for guidance on how best to get their issue resolved.

---++ perfSONAR  Deployment  Details  for WLCG  and  OSG
We  have created a set of  pages to guide the  deployment  of  perfSONAR for use by WLCG and OSG.  Please refer to  DeployperfSONAR to find  details  about installing updating  and  user perfSONAR in these  communities.

---++ OSG  Networking  Components
The plans for OSG networking include activity in these areas related to network monitoring:
   * The perfSONAR-PS toolkit: development, packaging, configuring and supporting the toolkit in the context of OSG but potentially applicable to a diverse set of users and VOs.
   * The OSG Network Service: targeting the development, packaging, deployment and maintenance of a network service which collects, aggregates, displays and provides network related metrics from the perfSONAR-PS toolkit deployments at OSG and WLCG sites.
   * [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/NetworkingTroubleShooting][Network problem solving documentation]]:  Updating and augmenting OSG documentation related to network problem troubleshooting using OSG distributed tools, software and services.

---++  Other Useful  Networking  References

OSG supports a number of services for networking including a *central ESmond datastore* which hosts all the OSG/WLCG perfSONAR data.   
   * Information on ESmond is available at http://software.es.net/esmond/
   * Information on querying the perfSONAR data from ESmond is at http://software.es.net/esmond/perfsonar_client_rest.html
   * Access to a JSON view of the OSG network datastore is available at http://psds.grid.iu.edu/esmond/perfsonar/archive/?format=json

We can monitor the OSG network metrics using *MaDDash* (ESnet&#39;s Monitoring and Diagnostic Dashboard)
   * OSG *MaDDash* instance http://psmad.grid.iu.edu/maddash-webui/index.cgi

The *basic service checking* to track and monitor all our perfSONAR services uses =OMD/Check_mk=.   NOTE:  You need an x.509 credential in your browser to view this
   * =OSG OMD/Check_MK= service monitoring https://psomd.grid.iu.edu/WLCGperfSONAR/check_mk/

The [[http://docs.perfsonar.net/][perfSONAR]] toolkit is part of the [[http://www.perfsonar.net/][perfSONAR]] project.   
The current perfSONAR-PS toolkit is [[http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_getting.html][available for download]]

Ilija Vukotic/University of Chicago has setup an *analytics platform* (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasComputing/ATLASAnalytics) using =Elastic Search= and =Kibana4=.   
   *  Here is the =Kibana4= web interface http://cl-analytics.mwt2.org:5601/ 

ESnet  maintains  an  excellent  set of  pages  about  networking,  end-system  tuning,  tools  and  techniques at https://fasterdata.es.net/  

The are two related projects for OSG Networking
   * *PuNDIT* (an OSG Satellite project) focusing on analyzing perfSONAR data to alert on problems: http://pundit.gatech.edu/   
   * *MadAlert* which analyzes *MaDDash* meshes to identify network problems: http://madalert.aglt2.org/madalert/
