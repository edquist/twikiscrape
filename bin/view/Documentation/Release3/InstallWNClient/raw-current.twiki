---+ Installing and Using the Worker Node Client From RPMs
%TOC{depth=&quot;3&quot;}%

---++ About This Guide

The *OSG Worker Node Client* is a collection of software components that is expected to be added to every worker node that can run OSG jobs. It provides a common environment and a minimal set of common tools that all OSG jobs can expect to use. See the [[#ReferenceSection][reference section]] below for contents of the Worker Node Client.

It is possible to install the Worker Node Client software in a variety of ways, depending on what works best for distributing and managing software at your site:

   * Install using RPMs and Yum (this guide) - useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef) that can automate RPM installs
   * [[InstallWNClientTarball][Install using a tarball]] - useful when installing onto a shared filesystem for distribution to worker nodes
   * [[UsingOSGWnClientFromOASIS][Use from OASIS]] - useful when worker nodes already mount [[NavTechOASIS][OASIS]] on your worker nodes

This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of configuring a site to make the Worker Node Client software available from an RPM.

---++ Before Starting

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

   * Ensure the host has [[SupportedOperatingSystems][a supported operating system]]
   * Obtain root access to the host
   * Prepare [[YumRepositories][the required Yum repositories]]
   * Install [[InstallCertAuth][CA certificates]]

---++ Install the Worker Node Client

Install the Worker Node Client RPM:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-wn-client&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Services

Fetch-CRL is the only service required to support the WN Client.

%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *Software* | *Service name* | *Notes* |
| Fetch CRL | On EL6 and EL7: =fetch-crl-boot= and =fetch-crl-cron= %BR% On EL5: =fetch-crl3-boot= and =fetch-crl3-cron= | See [[InstallCertAuth#Start_Stop_fetch_crl_A_quick_gui][CA documentation]] for more info |

%NOTE% =fetch-crl-boot= will begin fetching CRLS, which can take a few minutes and fail on transient errors. You can add configuration to ignore these transient errors in =/etc/fetch-crl.conf= for EL6 or EL7 machines or =/etc/fetch-crl3.conf= for EL5 machines: \
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;noerrors&lt;/pre&gt;

As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as =root=):

%TABLE{sort=&quot;off&quot;}%
| *To &amp;hellip;* | *Run the command &amp;hellip;* |
| Start a service | =service &lt;em&gt;SERVICE-NAME&lt;/em&gt; start= |
| Stop a service | =service &lt;em&gt;SERVICE-NAME&lt;/em&gt; stop= |
| Enable a service to start during boot | =chkconfig &lt;em&gt;SERVICE-NAME&lt;/em&gt; on= |
| Disable a service from starting during boot | =chkconfig &lt;em&gt;SERVICE-NAME&lt;/em&gt; off= |

---++ Validing the Worker Node Client

To verify functionality of the worker node client, you will need to submit a test job against your CE and verify the job&#39;s output.

   1. Submit a job that executes the =env= command (e.g. Run [[TroubleshootingHTCondorCE#condor_ce_trace][condor_ce_trace]] with the =-d= flag from your HTCondor CE)
   1. Verify that the value of =OSG_GRID= is set to =/etc/osg/wn-client=
