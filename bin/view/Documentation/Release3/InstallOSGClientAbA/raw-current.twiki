---+!! Installing OSG Client as Tarball (Anywhere by Anyone)
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC%

---# About This Document
%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users and system administrators. It covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools Package as a Tarball. This packaging is provided to allow installations &quot;Anywhere by Anyone&quot; (!AbA) (e.g. by non-root users or on NFS shares). If you have root access, your OS is %SUPPORTED_OS%, and have no special requirements, we recommend to use the native packages as described in InstallOSGClient. 
For more background on !AbA packages, see the [[SoftwareTeam.NonRootClients][non-root clients project page]].

This package is required on every host used by grid users to submit jobs, transfer data, or interact otherwise with the OSG. Note there is also a [[InstallWNClientAbA][Worker Node Client (!AbA]] and [[InstallWNClient][native)]] that is not a valid substitute for this package.  Likewise the OSG Client cannot replace the Worker Node Client in the batch jobs environment on %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%.  

The OSG Cient Tools Package includes:
   * the %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% providing client tools for authorization, data transfer and job submission.
   * a list of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCertificate][Certificates]] trusted by the OSG (installed separately).
   * the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCRL][Certificate Revocation List]] and tools to keep it current.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% client tools for job submission and workflow management.
   * client tools to access a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM% provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%.

%NOTE% This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation.UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation.UserCESimpleTest][here]].

---# Engineering Considerations

The OSG Client Tools Package is required on hosts used to submit jobs to the Open Science Grid. We recommend to install the OSG Client Tools on a _dedicated_ job submission host for large scale job submissions to production resources on the OSG. We recommend to use a [[#PublicIpAddress][public IP address and a fully qualified domain name]] for shared job submission hosts. 


---# Requirements
---## Host and OS
   1 A host to install the OSG Client (pristine node). No grid host certificate is required.
   1 OS is %SUPPORTED_OS%.  Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 5.

---## Certificates
   1 To test and use the installation a valid [[Documentation.CertificateUserGet][grid user certificate]] is required.

---## Networking
%STARTSECTION{&quot;Firewalls&quot;}%
%INCLUDE{&quot;FirewallInformation&quot; section=&quot;FirewallTable&quot; lines=&quot;portrange,portsource,condor&quot;}%

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% is not really a service on the client. It is the protocol used by the Globus clients. Anyway the clients still requires the port ranges to be open: job submission needs ports to reach the servers and to transfer back the output; file transfers need ports for control and data sessions.&lt;br&gt;
%LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% is in reality Condor-G the version configured to submit grid jobs.

---# Download, Installation and Configuration Procedure


---## Download the Client
Please pick the osg-client tarball that is appropriate for your distribution and architecture.
You will find them in [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/]] .

The latest available ones are:
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/osg-client-3.1.16-5.el5.i386.tar.gz][Full client 3.1.16-5 for 32-bit RHEL5]]
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/osg-client-3.1.16-5.el5.x86_64.tar.gz][Full client 3.1.16-5 for 64-bit RHEL5]]
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/osg-client-3.1.16-5.el6.i386.tar.gz][Full client 3.1.16-5 for 32-bit RHEL6]]
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/osg-client-3.1.16-5.el6.x86_64.tar.gz][Full client 3.1.16-5 for 64-bit RHEL6]]

---## Install the Client

   1. Unpack the tarball.
   1. Move the directory that was created to where you want the tarball client to be.
   1. Run =osg-post-install= (==%RED%/path/to/client/%ENDCOLOR%osg/osg-post-install==) to fix the directories in the installation.&lt;br/&gt; \
      Note that after this, you will not be able to relocate the install again.
   1. Download and set up CA certificiates using ==osg-ca-manage==
   1. Download !CRLs using fetch-crl (EL6) or fetch-crl3 (EL5)

Example install (in =$HOME/test-install=, the ==%RED%/path/to/client/%ENDCOLOR%== is =$HOME/test-install/osg-client= ):

&lt;verbatim class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% mkdir $HOME/test-install
%UCL_PROMPT% cd $HOME/test-install
%UCL_PROMPT% wget http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/osg-client-3.1.16-5.el6.x86_64.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xzf osg-client-3.1.16-5.el6.x86_64.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% cd osg-client
%UCL_PROMPT% osg/osg-post-install
%UCL_PROMPT% . setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% osg-ca-manage setupCA --url osg
%UCL_PROMPT% fetch-crl
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

%NOTE% Unpacking the tarball creates a osg-wn-client subdirectory

&lt;!--
---++!! Install Condor-G
Optionally, you may want to install Condor-G, too. Condor-G is needed to submit jobs directly to the OSG sites.&lt;br&gt;
*Note:* Most users don&#39;t need this.

   1. Install the osg-client-condor meta package, which will pull in all dependencies. &lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-client condor   &lt;/pre&gt;
--&gt;

---# Services
The client is a collection of client programs that do not require service startup or shutdown. 
The only services are osg-update-certs that keeps uptodate the CA certificates and fetch-crl that keeps uptodate the CRLs.
&lt;!--
The only services are osg-update-certs that keeps uptodate the CA certificates, fetch-crl that keeps uptodate the CRLs and the optional HTCondor-G, only if you installed it.
%NOTE% Avoid to interfere with the system HTCondor. If you are root, the commands below may start/stop/... also a HTCondor installed outside of the client installation. Be aware of which one you are controlling.
--&gt;

---## Auto-updating certificates and CRLs

You must create cron jobs to run fetch-crl/fetch-crl3 and osg-update-certs to update your !CRLs and certificates automatically.

Here is what they should look like. (Note: fill in %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR% with the full path of your tarball install, including =osg-client= that is created by the tarball).

&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
# Cron job to update certs.
# Runs every hour by default, though does not update certs until they&#39;re at
# least 24 hours old.  There is a random sleep time for up to 45 minutes (2700
# seconds) to avoid overloading cert servers.
10 * * * *   ( . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh &amp;&amp; osg-update-certs --random-sleep 2700 --called-from-cron )
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
# Cron job to update CRLs for EL5:
# Runs every 6 hours at, 45 minutes +/- 3 minutes.
42 */6 * * *   ( . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh &amp;&amp; fetch-crl3 -q -r 360 )
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
# Cron job to update CRLs for EL6:
# Runs every 6 hours at, 45 minutes +/- 3 minutes.
42 */6 * * *   ( . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh &amp;&amp; fetch-crl -q -r 360 )
&lt;/pre&gt;

You might want to configure proxy settings in $OSG_LOCATION/etc/fetch-crl.conf (EL6) or $OSG_LOCATION/etc/fetch-crl3.conf (EL5)

---## Starting and Enabling Services
To start the services you must edit your cron with ==crontab -e== and add the lines above.

---## Stopping and Disabling Services
To stop the services you must edit your cron with ==crontab -e== and remove the lines above.


---# Usage
A user must set up their environment before running any of the software provided in the client.

There are two way to do this: either source =setup.sh= or =setup.csh= before
running a command, or use the =osgrun= wrapper. All three files are located in
the top-level directory of the client. In the examples below replace %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR% with the path of your tarball install, including the osg-client directory resulting from the tarball (e.g. =$HOME/test-install/osg-client=).

%NOTE% If =setup.sh=, =setup.csh=, or =osgrun= are missing, then run
=osg/osg-post-install= to (re)create them.

Example usage with =setup.sh=: &lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% grid-proxy-init
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run &lt;em&gt;GATEKEEPER&lt;/em&gt; /usr/bin/id
&lt;/pre&gt;

(If using =csh= or =tcsh=, source =setup.csh= instead of =setup.sh=)

The user might find it convenient to create a shell alias to =setup.sh= to avoid having to type the full path every session.
For example by adding the following to their =~/.bashrc=:
&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
alias source_setup=&quot;. %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example usage with =osgrun=: &lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/osgrun grid-proxy-init
%UCL_PROMPT% %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/osgrun globus-job-run &lt;em&gt;GATEKEEPER&lt;/em&gt; /usr/bin/id
&lt;/pre&gt;

The advantage of =osgrun= is that the environment of the user is left
unchanged, whereas sourcing =setup.sh= or =setup.csh= will modify variables
like =PATH=, =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=, and others, until the user exits from their
shell.

The user might find it useful to set up a shell alias to =osgrun= to avoid having to type the full path every command.
For example by adding the following to their =~/.bashrc=:
&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
alias osgrun=&quot;%RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/osgrun&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
