---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators and users. It provides information about the software installed on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% and the services provided.

%NOTE% Instructions for installing a Compute Element can be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall][here]].


&lt;!-- ---+!! Compute Element: Software and Services --&gt;



---+ Installation paths

The OSG !RPMs install software in filesystem locations following the [[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/][FHS]] guidelines.  Accordingly most binaries are located in =/usr/bin/= or =/usr/sbin/= .  Unlike with previous OSG Pacman releases, you will not need to source a =setup.sh= script before working with OSG.    The configuration files are all in =/etc/= or its subdirectories, with =osg-configure= and GIP using configuration files in =/etc/osg/config.d= .  Log files are all located in =/var/log= or its subdirectories. Other OSG output files, such as =osg-attributes.conf= and other auto-generated files, are located in =/var/lib/osg=.  



---+ Services

The CE services installed by !RPMs by default place cron or startup scripts in the appropriate locations (e.g. =/etc/init.d=) but do not enable or start these services.  Admins can enable, start, and stop services using the =chkconfig= or =service= commands.  E.g. use =chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on= or =service fetch-crl-cron start= or =service fetch-crl-cron stop= to enable, start, and stop the fetch-crl-cron service respectively.

The CE needs to run the =globus-gatekeeper=, =tomcat5 (2)=, =globus-gridftp-server=, and the appropriate gratia job manager probe in order to provide the minimal services required of a gatekeeper.  In addition, the =edg-mkgridmap= or the =gums-client-cron= services will need to be enabled and running depending on whether your resource is using gridmap or gums for authorization. Finally, if your gatekeeper is using any of the !RPMs that provides CA certificates and !CRLs, the =fetch-crl-cron= (1) and =fetch-crl-boot= (1) services should be enabled so that !CRLs are up to date.

%NOTE%   (1) On OSG 3.1.15 and later on EL5 (Centos5 and SL5), =fetch-crl3= is installed instead of =fetch-crl= and the services are called =fetch-crl3-cron= and =fetch-crl3-boot=.
%NOTE% (2) On EL6 systems =tomcat6= is used instead of =tomcat5=.

---+ The services that are installed on a CE are as follows:

---++ Cron Services
%INCLUDE{&quot;OSGServices&quot; section=&quot;CECronServices&quot;}%

---++ Init.d Services
%INCLUDE{&quot;OSGServices&quot; section=&quot;CEInitServices&quot;}%

---++ Inetd Services
%INCLUDE{&quot;OSGServices&quot; section=&quot;CEInetdServices&quot;}%

---++ Log file rotation
Log files are now located in =/var/log= or subdirectories within that directory.  Threrefore, you can use the standard logrotate script or it&#39;s equivalents to rotate log files, the logrotation configurations for the log files generated by OSG services are located in =/etc/logrotate.d=.  The logrotate configuration files provided handle all of the log files generated by the OSG provided services.

---++ Changing Globus Settings

If you change any settings for GRAM, including
   1 =/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf=,
   1 =/etc/globus/globus-condor.conf=, or
   1 Contents of the perl jobmanager (which, by the way, will get overwritten on upgrade),
the changes will not take effect until you kill off the old =globus-job-manager= processes.  This is a change from OSG 1.2, as =globus-job-manager= processes are now persistent.

This can be done with the following command, as =root=:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% killall globus-job-manager
&lt;/pre&gt;
