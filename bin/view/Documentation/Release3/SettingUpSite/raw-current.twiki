---+Setting Up an OSG Site

An OSG [[Documentation.GlossaryOfTerms#DefsSite][site]] is usually a
cluster of computers configured to accept OSG jobs. This document
presents the information necessary to set up a site. There is an
administrative part to this and a technical part. The steps are as
follows.

---++ Do Background Reading

Please start with the links on the
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/about][OSG About page]]. 

The [[Documentation.UsingTheGrid][Using The Grid]] page has more details, mostly from the user&#39;s
point of view, and is at least worth skimming now.

---++ Identify VO(s) That Will Own the Site

There may already be one that would own the site (you
would most likely already know this), or it may be
necessary to create a new VO. There is some
documentation on the page about
[[Documentation.Release3.NavOsgVO][virtual organizations]].

---++ Get certificates

X509 certificates are the main way to authenticate on
the Open Science Grid, although the OSG is trying ways
for grid users to run jobs without personal
certificates.

Obtaining certificates to identify yourself and your
servers may take a few days.

---+++ Get an X509 Personal Certificate

A personal certificate is necessary to run jobs for
testing, to access storage, and to authenticate with
the OSG web sites. Please follow the
[[Documentation.CertificateGetWeb][OSG instructions]]
to obtain one.

If you already have an X509 certificate for some other
purpose then it may also be recognized on OSG. {The
supported CAs are in the osg-ca-certs rpm. Is there a
URL for this?} Some schools and labs also issue their
own certificates.


---+++ Become a Gridadmin

Host and service certificates are required to set up
the site. A gridadmin is a person designated by a site
who can approve or deny OSG host and service
certificate requests for your site. Basically this
means verifying that each certificate request is
allowed.  The gridadmin does not have to be the same
person who acts as a sysadmin for the site.

The gridadmin should
[[Operations/OIMRegistrationInstructions#Registering_Yourself][register their personal certificate in OIM]].  Then they should
click on the &quot;Request for Griddmin Enrollment&quot; button
on the top left corner of and
[[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/gridadmin][fill out the form]].

Once you are set up as a gridamin, you can approve host
certificates that had been
[[Documentation.Release3.GetHostServiceCertificates#Request_a_Host_Certificate][requested]]  (by anyone) 
with a command like this

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
   $ osg-gridadmin-cert-request --hostname=gandalf.yoursite.edu
&lt;/pre&gt;

The gridadmin would go to &quot;My Requests&quot; under

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificatehost
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

to approve these. The certificate should be issued in a
couple minutes with no further action.

We also have some general documentation about
[[Security/PKIDocumentationIndex][OSG security]].
    

---++ Decide on the Site Architecture

We have a  document for [[Documentation.Release3/SitePlanning][site planning]] 
in general, and one for  [[Documentation.Release3/NavAdminSmallSites][small sites]]
that describe the different components of a site.

 
There are two steps which are mostly independent:
getting the site to accept jobs from OSG users, and
being able to submit jobs to OSG.

---+++ Arranging for the Site to Accept Jobs

All sites must have what is called a &#39;compute element&#39;
or CE, which coordinates the work on the site, so we
suggest starting by
[[Documentation.Release3/InstallComputeElement][installing, registering, and testing one]].
   
Likely you should also
[[Documentation.Release3/InstallOSGClient][install an OSG-recommended set of software]] on each worker
node.


---+++ How Users May Submit Jobs to the Open Science Grid

The easiest way for users to submit jobs to other OSG
sites is by using resources maintained by OSG Staff:

   * If there are just a few users, then OSG may be able
     to make them accounts on some OSG-owned interactive
     login machines. We typically direct individual users to [[http://osgconnect.net/][OSG Connect]]
     and groups of users to a machine called xd-login.opensciencegrid.org.
     
   * If more usage is expected, then users may be able to
     use [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/][BOSCO]] or
     [[Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/InstallCondorFlockSubmit][flocking]] to
     submit jobs to OSG from your own site&#39;s [[Documentation/Release3/InstallOSGClient][submit host]],
     which you&#39;d have to install.
     
   * If lots of usage is expected, then installing a
     [[Documentation.Release3.InstallGlideinWMSFrontend][glideinWMS front end]]
     may be worthwhile.

A site may also submit jobs entirely using its own
resources, usually either through
[[Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGClient][Condor-G]]
or by installing a
[[Documentation.Release3.InstallGlideinWMSFactory][glideinWMS factory]]. Running on multiple sites with Condor-G is
awkward. !GlideinWMS works well for this but can be
time-consuming to install and maintain.

---++ Supporting Globally-Accessible Storage at a Site

Many sites have [[Storage.WebHome][storage]] that is
accessible from all of the worker nodes.

One part of storage that has become important is a
shared, read-only file system called
[[Documentation.Release3/InstallCvmfs][CVMFS]]
for distributing software.

---++ Contact Information

   * Please contact the user support team for help
        at user-support@opensciencegrid.org .
      Job submission and storage are especially evolving
      and complicated topics on the OSG. We suggest
      discussing them with Open Science Grid user support
      team.

   * Please subscribe to the
     [[Documentation.Release3.ContactsMailingLists][OSG-General and OSG-Sites email lists]].
     
   * After the basic functionality of the site is working,
     you should also attend [[Operations/WebHome][a meeting of the OSG-Operations team]] one Monday to introduce your site.

---++ General References
 
There is a list of
[[Documentation.Release3][all the different documentation available]], most of it potentially
useful to site administrators.  We recommend at least reading
over the list of topics to start with.
 
There is also a
