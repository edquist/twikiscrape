---+ Berkeley Storage Manager

!BeStMan, or Berkeley Storage Manager, is a full implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, for a disk based storage and mass storage systems. End users may have their own personal !BeStMan that manages and gives an SRM interface to their own local disks. It works on top of existing disk-based unix file systems, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp. It requires minimal administrative efforts on the deployment and updates.  !BeStMan2 is a Jetty based implementation of SRM v2.2, as opposed to globus container based implementation in the previous !BeStMan.
