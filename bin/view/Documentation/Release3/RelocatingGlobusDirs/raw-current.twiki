---+ Relocating Globus Directories

By default, Globus GRAM writes a handful of files per job in various directories:
   * State and lock files: This is a checkpoint of the GRAM job&#39;s state; defaults to =/var/lib/globus/gram_job_state=; there is one file per job.  If you use Condor, there is additionally one log file per job.  There&#39;s a third file, a lock file, which is a link to the per-globus-job-manager lockfile in =/var/lib/globus/gram_job_state/$LOGNAME/$HOSTNAME=.  The latter directory contains a credential, a lock file, a pid file, and a communication socket.
   * Cached executables: Each executable is written into a cache; identical executables will only be written once; this defaults to =$HOME/.globus/.gass_cache=.  There is at least one file per job (the executable).  Except for Condor, this directory must be shared with worker nodes.
   * Job home directory: This directory is created per-job (defaults to =$HOME/.globus/job/$HOSTNAME/$GRAM_ID=).  It provides the default $CWD on job startup, and it is where the stdout, stderr, remote I/O contact file, and proxy credentials are kept.  Except for Condor, this directory must be shared with worker nodes.
      * A job can ask for a specific, non-default, starting directory.  This is strongly discouraged and likely doesn&#39;t work at many OSG sites.
   * Scratch directory: If there are additional input files, a temporary directory ( of the form =$HOME/gram_scratch_XYZ=) is created; the input files are placed there.  If there are no input files, this directory is not created.  Except for Condor, this directory must be shared with worker nodes.

So, for a Condor job with 2 input files to successfully launch, 10 unique files and 2 new directories must be created; 7 of these go into the user&#39;s $HOME by default.

There are many good reasons to want to separate GRAM from $HOME.  Condor requires no shared directories at all - but even for PBS, separating the two makes management of these Globus files easier.

---++ Relocating directories:

The directories used by GRAM are controlled in =/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf=.  The relevant options are:
   * =-state-file-dir=.  This controls the state and lock files; it defaults to =/var/lib/globus/gram_job_state=.  We recommend keeping it there.  The state file directory must be root-owned and mode 1777.
   * =-cache-location=.  This controls the cache files; if you want to change this, we recommend setting it to =/var/lib/globus/gass_cache/$(LOGNAME)= and creating =/var/lib/globus/gass_cache= with root and mode 1777.
   * =-globus-job-dir=.  This controls the job home directories; if you want to change this, we recommend setting it to =/var/lib/globus/job_home= (pre-create this directory as root-owned, mode 1777).  See the note below about the RVF file.
   * =-scratch-dir-base=. This controls location of gram_scratch directories.  If you want to change this, we recommend setting it to =/var/lib/globus/gram_scratch= (pre-create the directory, root-owned, mode 1777).

All the recommendations above are for Condor.  For PBS, remember the last three directories must be exported to all the worker nodes *and* have the same directory name on the worker nodes.  It might be convenient to use the prefix =/mnt/nfs/globus= instead of =/var/lib/globus= in such a case.  None of the directories are written to by the root user, so root_squash for NFS mounts is acceptable.

---++ RVF file changes

If you relocate the =globus-job-dir= above, you need to add the following text to =/etc/globus/gram/job-manager.rvf=:

&lt;pre&gt;
# RSL Validation Information for the base RSL supported by the job
# manager
Attribute: directory
Description: &quot;Specifies the path of the directory the jobmanager will use as
              the default directory for the requested job.&quot;
Default: /var/lib/globus/job_home/$(LOGNAME)
ValidWhen: GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT
DefaultWhen: GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT
&lt;/pre&gt;
