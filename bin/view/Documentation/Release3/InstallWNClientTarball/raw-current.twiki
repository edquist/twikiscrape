---+ Installing and Using the Worker Node Client from Tarballs (Anywhere by Anyone)
%TOC{depth=&quot;3&quot;}%

---++ Introduction
This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of installing the worker node software and configuring the installed worker node software. Contents of the WN Client can be found [[InstallWNClient#4_Contents_of_the_worker_node][here]].

If you are installing the OSG WN Client following these instruction, then remember to set correctly OSG_GRID (see [[EnvironmentVariables]] and the [[IniConfigurationOptions#Storage][CE configuration instructions]]). The value set for OSG_GRID must be the path returned by ==echo $OSG_LOCATION== once you source the setup file created by this installation.

---++ About This Guide

The _OSG Worker Node Client_ is a collection of software components that is expected to be added to every worker node that can run OSG jobs. It provides a common environment and a minimal set of common tools that all OSG jobs can expect to use. See the [[#ReferenceSection][reference section]] below for contents of the Worker Node Client.

It is possible to install the Worker Node Client software in a variety of ways, depending on what works best for distributing and managing software at your site:

   * Install using a tarball (this guide) - useful when installing onto a shared filesystem for distribution to worker nodes
   * [[InstallWNClient][Install using RPMs and Yum]] - useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef) that can automate RPM installs
   * [[UsingOSGWnClientFromOASIS][Use from OASIS]] - useful when worker nodes already mount [[NavTechOASIS][OASIS]] on your worker nodes

This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of configuring a site to make the Worker Node Client software available from a tarball.

---++ Before Starting

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

   * Ensure the host has [[SupportedOperatingSystems][a supported operating system]]

---++ Download, Installation and Configuration Procedure

---+++ Download the WN Client
Please pick the osg-wn-client tarball that is appropriate for your distribution and architecture.
You will find them in [[http://repo.grid.iu.edu/tarball-install/]] .

%NOTE% The OSG 3.2 series is deprecated. It will no longer be supported after August 9th, 2016.

---+++ Install the WN Client

   1. Unpack the tarball.
   1. Move the directory that was created to where you want the tarball WN client to be.
   1. Run =osg-post-install= (==%RED%/path/to/client/%ENDCOLOR%osg/osg-post-install==) to fix the directories in the installation.&lt;br/&gt; \
      Note that after this, you will not be able to relocate the install again.
   1. Source the setup ==source %RED%/path/to/client/%ENDCOLOR%setup.sh== (or ==setup.csh== depending on the shell)
   1. Download and set up CA certificiates using ==osg-ca-manage== (See OsgCaManage for the available options)
   1. Download !CRLs using ==fetch-crl== (EL6) or ==fetch-crl3== (EL5)

Example install (in =$HOME/test-install=, the ==%RED%/path/to/client/%ENDCOLOR%== is =$HOME/test-install/osg-wn-client= ):

&lt;pre class=&#39;screen&#39;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% mkdir $HOME/test-install
%UCL_PROMPT% cd $HOME/test-install
%UCL_PROMPT% wget http://repo.grid.iu.edu/tarball-install/3.3/osg-wn-client-latest.el6.x86_64.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xzf osg-wn-client-latest.el6.x86_64.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% cd osg-wn-client
%UCL_PROMPT% osg/osg-post-install
%UCL_PROMPT% . setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% osg-ca-manage setupCA --url osg
%UCL_PROMPT% fetch-crl
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

%NOTE% Unpacking the tarball creates an osg-wn-client subdirectory

---+++ Configure the WN Client

Configure the value of OSG_GRID (see [[EnvironmentVariables]] and the [[IniConfigurationOptions#Storage][CE configuration instructions]]) on the CE. The value set for OSG_GRID must be the path returned by ==echo $OSG_LOCATION== once you source the setup file created by this installation.

---++++ Configuring the CE for wn-client tarballs (!AbA)
Using the wn-client software installed from the tarball will require a few changes on the compute element so that the resource&#39;s configuration can be correctly reported.  The =$OSG_GRID= variable, which points to the location of the wn-client installation directory, will need to point to the installation directory including =osg-wn-client= that is part of the tarball (referred above as &amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;).  Most jobs source =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= before performing any work.   So set =$OSG_GRID= (in the CE config.ini) to =%RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%= .

On a mixed RPM/pacman based system, a possible solution would be to symlink the existing =$OSG_GRID= location (%RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR% defined above) to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.

---++ Services
The WN client is a collection of client programs that do not require service startup or shutdown. 
The only services are osg-update-certs that keeps uptodate the CA certificates and fetch-crl that keeps uptodate the CRLs.
Following the instructions below you&#39;ll add the services to your crontab that will take care to run them periodically until you remove them.

---+++ Auto-updating certificates and CRLs

You must create cron jobs to run fetch-crl/fetch-crl3 and osg-update-certs to update your !CRLs and certificates automatically.

Here is what they should look like. (Note: fill in %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR% with the full path of your tarball install, including =osg-client= that is created by the tarball).

&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
# Cron job to update certs.
# Runs every hour by default, though does not update certs until they&#39;re at
# least 24 hours old.  There is a random sleep time for up to 45 minutes (2700
# seconds) to avoid overloading cert servers.
10 * * * *   ( . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh &amp;&amp; osg-update-certs --random-sleep 2700 --called-from-cron )
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
# Cron job to update CRLs for EL5:
# Runs every 6 hours at, 45 minutes +/- 3 minutes.
42 */6 * * *   ( . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh &amp;&amp; fetch-crl3 -q -r 360 )
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#39;file&#39;&gt;
# Cron job to update CRLs for EL6:
# Runs every 6 hours at, 45 minutes +/- 3 minutes.
42 */6 * * *   ( . %RED%&amp;lt;OSG_LOCATION&amp;gt;%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh &amp;&amp; fetch-crl -q -r 360 )
&lt;/pre&gt;

You might want to configure proxy settings in $OSG_LOCATION/etc/fetch-crl.conf (EL6) or $OSG_LOCATION/etc/fetch-crl3.conf (EL5)

---+++ Starting and Enabling Services
To start the services you must edit your cron with ==crontab -e== and add the lines above.

---+++ Stopping and Disabling Services
To stop the services you must edit your cron with ==crontab -e== and remove or comment the lines above.

---++ Validing the Worker Node Client

To verify functionality of the worker node client, you will need to submit a test job against your CE and verify the job&#39;s output.

   1. Submit a job that executes the =env= command (e.g. Run [[TroubleshootingHTCondorCE#condor_ce_trace][condor_ce_trace]] with the =-d= flag from your HTCondor CE)
   1. Verify that the value of =OSG_GRID= is set to the directory of your WN Client installation
