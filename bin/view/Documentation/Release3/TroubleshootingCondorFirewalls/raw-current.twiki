---++Setting high and low ports for Condor

If a client is firewalled it may be necessary to specify a port range for Condor&#39;s use.

---+++Recommendations
In the condor_config file (pointed to by the environment variable =$OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG=) set the following values:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
HIGHPORT = &amp;lt;high port&amp;gt;
LOWPORT = &amp;lt;low port&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember to check the client&#39;s firewall as well to be certain the specified range is compatible.
