---++ HTCondor Issues

   * Verify that the [[InstallCondor#NetworkingReq][Firewall Configuration]] is suitable for Condor
   * Verify that the [[GridMonitor][Condor Grid Monitor is running]] on the submission site

---++ HTCondor Errors
   * [[CondorErrorMissingQueueCommand][ERROR: &quot;&amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&quot; doesn&#39;t contain any &quot;queue&quot; commands -- no jobs queued]]

---++ HTCondor Log Files
Further troubleshooting can be done inspecting the HTCondor log files of the various daemons (use =condor_config_val LOG= to find the location). To increase the logging level you [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.0/3_3Configuration.html#SECTION00434000000000000000][set the level of the specific daemon in the configuration file]], e.g. SCHEDD_DEBUG=D_FULLDEBUG
