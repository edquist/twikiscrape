---+!! Testing new !RSV probes

This page contains information for how !RSV probe developers can test their new probes into the RSV framework.

This page assumes you&#39;ve already [[WriteProbe][written]] and [[InstallProbe][installed]] an !RSV probe.  See [[WriteYourOwnRSVProbe][the overall process info]].

%TOC{depth=&quot;4&quot;}%

---++ Testing the !RSV probe

Try your new metric out using the rsv-control tool.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
rsv-control --run --host &lt;em&gt;foo.example.com&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;org.osg.your.metric&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Common problems

---++++ ERROR: Metric does not exist at /opt/itb/osg-rsv/bin/metrics/org.osg.your.metric

This means that you have not created a symlink in the =VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/metrics= directory.  Create a symlink named after your metric in this directory.  It should point at your probe.  See the other symlinks in this directory for an example.

---++++ ERROR: Mandatory config file &#39;/opt/itb/osg-rsv/meta/metrics/org.osg.your.metric.meta&#39; does not exist

You need to create a meta file at the location specified.

---++++ ERROR: Metric configuration is missing &#39;service-type&#39; or &#39;execute&#39; declaration

You did not specify either &#39;service-type&#39; or &#39;execute&#39; in the meta file.  See the [[InstallProbe][install probe section]] for info on this.
