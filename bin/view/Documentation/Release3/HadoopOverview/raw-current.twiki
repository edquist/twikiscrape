---+ About this Document

The Hadoop Distributed File System (!HDFS) is a highly scalable, very reliable distributed file system developed by the Apache project as a part of the Hadoop data processing system.  The primary contributor (and largest user) is Yahoo.  !HDFS is based on the design of the Google File System.  !HDFS&#39;s strengths is in its ability to use commodity hard drives in worker nodes; it can turn a large amount of semi-reliable hardware into a system which is very reliable.

To find out more information about HDFS, [[http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/][visit its home page]].  If you are thinking about installing Hadoop, we also recommend reading the [[http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_design.html][HDFS architecture page]].

This page covers the OSG&#39;s usage of Hadoop, and includes instructions for installing a grid-enabled HDFS system.
