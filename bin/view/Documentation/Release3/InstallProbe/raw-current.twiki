---+!! Installing and testing !RSV probes

This page contains information for how !RSV probe developers can install their new probes into the RSV framework.

This page assumes you&#39;ve already written an !RSV probe.  See [[WriteProbe][the guidelines for writing an RSV probe]] or see [[WriteYourOwnRSVProbe][the overall process info]].

%TOC{depth=&quot;4&quot;}%

---++ How to install probes
   1 Put probe in =/usr/libexec/rsv/probes= directory.  Remember that the probe filename must end with =-probe=
   1 Put any helper scripts in the =/usr/libexec/rsv/probes/worker-scripts= directory
   1 [[#MetricSymlinks][Make metric symlinks]]
   1 [[#ConfFiles][Create a .conf file]]
   1 [[#MetaFiles][Create a .meta file]]

#MetricSymlinks
---++ Make metric symlinks
Make a symlink for each metric that the probe implements in =/usr/libexec/rsv/metrics= directory pointing at probe:
&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
cd /usr/libexec/rsv/metrics
ln -s ../probes/my-probe-name org.osg.my.metric1
ln -s ../probes/my-probe-name org.osg.my.metric2
&lt;/pre&gt;

To make sure that rsv-control can find your probe run =rsv-control --list --all= and you should see your metrics listed now.


#MetaFiles
---++ Meta files

Meta files are the default probe configuration.  The .meta file is not meant to be edited by end users (they will edit the .conf file, see below).  Meta files consist of two parts - a settings section and an environment section.  You should create a .meta file at =/etc/rsv/meta/metrics/org.osg.your.metric.meta=

Here&#39;s an example meta file, we&#39;ll break down the sections after the example.

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[org.osg.general.osg-version]
default-cron-interval = 47 18 * * *

execute = grid
transfer-files = /usr/libexec/rsv/probes/RSVMetric.pm
service-type = OSG-CE
output-format = brief
enable-by-default = true
description = Report the version of the remote CE.

[org.osg.general.osg-version env]
# No environment definitions needed for this metric
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+++ Settings section
Th settings section begins with the header =[org.osg.your.metric]=.  The information in this section replaces the information that used to be declared at the top of the !RSV probes.  Here are the essential settings:
| *Setting* | *Example value* | *Description* |
| default-cron-interval | 27 * * * * | A cron time formatted string that represents when the metric will run.  We do not currently have a well defined method to determine when probes should run - talk to the VDT for help in determining this value |
| execute | local or grid | Set =local= if the metric should execute on the local machine and =grid= if the metric should execute on the remote CE. |
| service-type | OSG-CE | This categorizes the metric.  =OSG-CE= for CE metrics and =OSG-SRM= for storage metrics are the most common. |
| output-format | brief or wlcg | Set this based on the output you generate.  See [[WriteProbe][here]] for more info. |
| enable-by-default | true or false | All new probes should default to false until they have been tested. |
| need-proxy | true or false | If your probe requires a proxy set this to true, otherwise false.  Note that all execute=remote probes should set this to true |
| description | &lt;text&gt; | A human-readable description of what this metric does.
| transfer-files | &lt;List of files&gt; | The set of accompanying files that should be transferred to the remote computer in addition to the probe.  This option is only needed for remote probes |

---+++ Environment section
Most metrics will not need to define anything in this section.  However, if your metric relies on any specific environment variables being set to function, you can provide them here.  An example is for SRM probes, which might need SRM_HOME.

The environment section starts with the header =[org.osg.your.metric env]=.  This contains any specific environment settings your probe will need to run.  There are four actions you can take:
| *Action Name* | *Action Action* | 
| SET | Set a variable in the environment |
| UNSET | Remove a variable from the environment |
| PREPEND | Prepend a path to an environment variable |
| APPEND | Append a path to an environment variable |

#ConfFiles
---++ Conf files

Configuration files are meant to be edited by a site admin.  You&#39;ll just be making a skeleton conf file for the admin to add to later.  More information on .conf files is available [[ConfigureRsv#MetricConfig][here]].  

For each *metric* you implement add a file named =/etc/rsv/metrics/org.osg.your.metric.conf=.

For example, to implement the =org.osg.example.metric= metric, make a file named =org.osg.example.metric.conf= and make the first line of the file:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[org.osg.example.metric args]
&lt;/pre&gt;

You probably don&#39;t need to put anything else in here, but if you have interesting options to your probe, you can put in commented out entries as a template for users to fill in.  Here&#39;s an example:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry args]
#cacerts-dir = 
#warning-hours = 
#error-hours = 
#type = 
#worker-script-file = 
#local-ce = 
&lt;/pre&gt;
