#DefsOpenGridServicesArchitecture
   $ Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA): A Services Architecture represents an evolution towards a Grid system architecture based on Web services concepts and technologies. _See also_ Globus&#39;s [[http://www.globus.org/ogsa/][Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) site]].

#DefsOpenScienceGridIM
   $ Open Science Grid Information Management (OIM): A service that defines the topology used by various OSG systems and services; it is based on the OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document available at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18. For example, !MyOSG, BDII, and Gratia all use topology defined in OIM.

   $ Ownership: A state of having absolute or well-defined partial rights and responsibilities for a [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsResource][Resource]] depending on the type of control. OSG considers two such types: actual Ownership and Ownership by virtue of a Contract/Lease. A Lessee is a limited Owner of the Resource for the duration of the Contract/Lease.
