Penelope suggests a using splitting the user/site admin/support center/monitoring and adding a left hand link
More depth for each user/site admin/support center/monitoring

Consolidate and simplify information... The documentation needs to be cleaned up in general.

Existing documentation on the Twiki is confusing, incomplete, and sometimes wrong.

PR stuff will be at consortium pages. Consortium link at bottom of left hand menu?

New users &quot;getting started&quot; link show be at high level. Dane has attempted to write this, Penelope will review.
