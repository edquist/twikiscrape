---++ About This Document
Here are some basic steps one can take when investigating an incident on a machine used in the OSG.  These are by no means comprehensive in everything that should be looked into.  But they can give a good indication if there is a problem, and also what additional steps may need to be taken.

---++ Inspect Batch System
---+++ Where did the job run?
   * Fork jobmanager or batch system
   * If batch system, which node
   * For Condor 
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_q -l %RED%job_id %ENDCOLOR%
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_q –l  %RED%userid %ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * For PBS
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% qstat -f  %RED%job_identifier %ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Review your batch system logs

---++ Locate User Processes
   * What processes are running for a user?
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% ps -u %RED%mis%ENDCOLOR% -U %RED%mis%ENDCOLOR% uwww
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Remember to locate processes on both Computing Element (CE) and Worker Node (WN)

---++Does the Job have any Open Files or Ports?
   * Use lsof and/or netstat
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT%lsof -u %RED%mis%ENDCOLOR% -P
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT%netstat -ap
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Did you find them?
      * An open hidden file (check /tmp and other world writable directories)
      * An open TCP connection
   * If the process running is a script - review the script code and try to identify what it is trying to do
   * If the executable is a binary file
      * Use strings command
      * Look for hostnames, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and other clues

---++ Killing Suspicious User Jobs 
   * Remove job from batch system (for Condor, pbs respectively)
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_rm %RED%cluster_id%ENDCOLOR% 
      %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% qdel %RED%job_id%ENDCOLOR% 
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Kill any lingering processes associated with the suspicious user
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
       %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% kill -9 %RED%process_id%ENDCOLOR%
       %UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% killall %RED%process_name%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;
   * Make sure all the suspicious user processes have been terminated

---++ What Ifs
   * All DNs from the VO are getting mapped to the same user DN.
      * Killing all the user process on the CE
         * Kills Condor-G grid-manager and Globus jobmanager processes of other users in the VO
         * VO should be able to recover from these failures
      * Selective killing of jobs associated with user DN
         * Possible by looking at logfiles, process timestamps
         * Will be tedious
         * Decision at the discretion of the sites
         * VOs will appreciate it 
   * User process is aggressively forking?
      * After killing suspicious processes, check for new processes using ps
      * Node shutdown/reboot may be required
      * *Beware of lingering effects (example: cron, at)*
  
---++ Handling Escalations
   * Investigate the incident
      * Follow your home organization’s security procedures and policies
      * Determine if there were any compromises arising from the incident
   * If you suspect that any other user accounts, certificates, proxies have been compromised due to this incident immediately follow the [[Documentation.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][incident reporting instructions]].
   * Any other policies/procedures for sites to follow? 
   * If the attacker succeeded in escalating the privileges by installing rootkits, the simple forensic techniques we have discussed here will be insufficient. 
      * Once an attacker has root access we can no longer rely on the commands we run on the node.
      * Run host and network based rootkit detector tools.
      * Review network traffic flows.
      * It would be advisable to remove the machine from the network, analyze the compromise, and wipe the machine clean.
      * Detailed discussion on topics regarding root level compromise is outside the scope of this page.
