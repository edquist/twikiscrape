#DefsVirtualDataToolkit
   $ Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT): A collection of grid middleware upon which the OSG software stack is based.  _See also_ [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/index.html][VDT site]].

#DefsVo
#DefsVirtualOrganization
   $ Virtual Organization (VO): A dynamic collection of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsUser][Users]], [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsResource][Resources]] and [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsService][Services]] for sharing of Resources. A VO is party to contracts between Resource Providers &amp; VOs which govern resource usage &amp; policies. A VO is a participating organization in a grid to which grid end-users must be registered and authenticated in order to gain access to the grid&#39;s resources. A VO must provide resources and/or establish resource-usage agreements with grid resource providers. Members of a VO may come from many different home institutions, may have in common only a general interest or goal (e.g., CMS physics analysis), and may communicate and coordinate their work solely through information technology (hence the term virtual). An organization like a High Energy Physics experiment can be regarded as one VO.  A subVO is a subset of the Users and Services within a VO which operates under the contracts of the parent.

   $ Virtual Site: A set of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsSite][Sites]] that agree to use the same policies in order to act as an administrative unit. Sites and [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsFacility][Facilities]] negotiate a common administrative context to form a &quot;virtual&quot; site or facility.

   $ Volatile File: A file that is temporary in nature, but has a ([[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsPin][pin]]) lifetime guarantee.

   $ Volatile Storage: Storage in which the &quot;volatile&quot; physical replica of a file is subject to removal from the Storage Resource Manager [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsSrm][SRM]] or Distributed Resource Manager (DRM) according to preset policies.

#DefsVomrs
   $ Virtual Organization Management Registration Service (VOMRS): VOMRS is a server that provides the means for registering members of a Virtual Organization, and coordination of this process among the various VO and grid resource administrators. VOMRS consists of a database to maintain user registration and institutional information, and a web user interface (web UI) for input of data into the database and manipulation of that data. The database is shared with the [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVoms][Virtual Organization Membership System.]] _See also_ http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/.

#DefsVoms
   $ Virtual Organization Membership System (VOMS): A system that manages real-time user authorization information for a VO. VOMS is designed to maintain, in a database shared with the [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVomrs][VO Management Registration Service]], only general information regarding the relationship of the user with his VO, e.g., groups he belongs to, certificate-related information, and capabilities he should present to resource providers for special processing needs. It maintains no personal identifying information besides the certificate. VOMS has 2 components: VOMS-Admin and VOMS-Server.  Each officially registered VO in Open Science Grid is expected to have a functional VOMS system, either operated by itself or by arrangement with another VO.

#DefsVomsAdmin
   $ VOMS-Admin: The components of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVoms][Virtual Organization Membership System (VOMS)]] which is used for administration and book-keeping with database. 

   $ VOMS-Server: The component of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVoms][Virtual Organization Membership System (VOMS)]] system which users contact to get a VOMS Proxy certificate. When a user issues a remote request to his VO&#39;s VOMS-Server (using voms-proxy-init command line client side tool), the VOMS-Server verifies user authenticity and grants an X.509 proxy certificate which contains extra attributes. Attributes returned by VOMS-Server are inserted into an [[http://www.rfc-ref.org/RFC-TEXTS/3281/index.html][RFC-3281]] compliant Attribute Certificate, and thus compatible with other formats, e.g., Globus format. The AC has tokens which represent user&#39;s group membership(s) and role(s) in his VO. 

#DefsVOMSProxy
   $ VOMS Proxy: A [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVoms][Virtual Organization Membership System (VOMS)]] Proxy is an extended X.509 [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGridProxy][Grid Proxy]] certificate which uses extra attributes to define the group membership(s) and role(s) of a grid end-user. Grid services can be configured to read these attributes from a proxy certificate and perform decisions based on their values.

   $ VO: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVo][Virtual Organization]].

   $ VO Manager: A person designated by a [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVo][Virtual Organization (VO)]] to be in charge of defining policies for the VO. These policies may be related to, but not limited to, resource usage and VO membership. This person is also usually, but not always, in charge of the team operating the VOMS system of the VO.
