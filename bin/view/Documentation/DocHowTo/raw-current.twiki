---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% This document is an overall reference for people playing any role in OSG official documentation; and, as such, contains or references all information about producing documentation in OSG.  Shorter, more focused documents are available for people filling the three major roles in documentation:
   * [[Documentation.DocForOwners][For Document Owners]]
   * [[Documentation.DocForReviewers][For Document Reviewers]]
   * [[Documentation.DocForTesters][For Document Testers]]

---++ The Documentation Process
The overall documentation process is described in this section.  This includes information on how Owners, Reviewers, and Testers control the creation, review, and update of documents.  
%INCLUDE{Documentation.DocProcess}%

---++ Document Classification and Organization
Documents in OSG are classified by Type and Role and are organized into document Areas.
%INCLUDE{&quot;Documentation.DocClassifications&quot;}%

---++ Content Management Control Variables and Tracking
The OSG process of creation, update, review, and testing of documents is managed through the use of 
a set of Content Management Variables in an HTML block at the end of each page.
In addition, the OSG Release Process includes a set of variables that should be used in all documents that refer to the items represented by those variables.
Finally, there is a set of command-like variables that allow you to easily create status tables for documents of interest to you.  These variables are described in the following sections.

#ContentManagementVariables
%INCLUDE{&quot;Documentation.DocManagementVariables&quot;}%

---+++ Release Variables
There are a set of variables that are to be used when referring to various constants like the current the current software release number.  These variables are described in [[Documentation.DocReleaseVariables][Release Variables]].

---+++ Tracking documents for which you have some responsibility
There are a set of tools (command like TWiki variables) to track various official documents in the OSG TWiki.
These can be used to create tables on your home page (typically !Main.FirstLast) that will list documents for which you are the Owner, Reviewer, or Tester.  Variables also exist for Area owners of documentation.  Complete information on these tools can be found in [[Documentation.DocTrackingTables][Tracking Documents]].

---++ Document Formatting
There are a set of formatting standards, methods to structure composite documents, and very useful formatting tools that automatically format certain types of information that are described  
in [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules][Document Formatting]].

---++ Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Documentation Architect and the Document Owners, Reviewers, and Testers are explained in the following sections.

---+++ Documentation Architect Responsibilities
The OSG Documentation Architect is responsible for establishing and maintaining the overall architecture, standards, processes, and guidelines for documentation provided by OSG for its members.  More detail can be found in Documentation.DocArchitectResponsibilities.
