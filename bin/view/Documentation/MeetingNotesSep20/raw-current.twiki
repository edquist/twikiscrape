---++&quot;Support For&quot; Items

   * a) how do I know which Site is supported by which Support Center - ie the mail address to use to contact site admins? -Rob will sort through list of resources and make sure that Support Centers are correct in the entries.  Then we can post this under the Support Centers links...

   * b) On the users support page it has a sentence about the DOE Grids but does not remind me whether I should go through my VO to get a certificate or use an RA or.. - Direct them to the VO for certificate questions.  Overview description would be useful in the Grid User&#39;s Guide.  Remove the whole bullet point. (done)

   * c) I think Education and Outreach each need their own menu link - not on user support. - It should go under OSG @ Work (top menu item)
