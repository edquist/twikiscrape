---++ About This Document
This document covers how site administrators can configure their hosts.allow and hosts.deny files to limit the outside locations that can connect to their site with SSH.

---++ Hosts files
The =/etc/hosts.allow= and =/etc/hosts.deny= files provide simple access control for system services such as SSH.
Allowing access to the SSH service only from trusted hosts is a simple and effective method of minimizing exposure to SSH-based attacks.

In =/etc/hosts.allow=, add a list of trusted hosts for the =sshd= service:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
#
# hosts.allow	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#		allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#		by the &#39;/usr/sbin/tcpd&#39; server.
#
sshd: LOCAL, host1.example.com, host2.example.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then in =/etc/hosts.deny=, configure the =sshd= service to deny connections from all other hosts:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
#
# hosts.deny	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#		*not* allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#		by the &#39;/usr/sbin/tcpd&#39; server.
#
sshd: ALL
&lt;/pre&gt;

%IMPORTANT% *Be sure to test your configuration before you close your current terminal session!*
