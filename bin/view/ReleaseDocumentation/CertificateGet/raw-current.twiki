---++ About This Document
If you don&#39;t know what a X509 certificate is or what it is used for, see [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateWhatIs][What is a certificate?]].

This document describes how to get and set up a *personal* certificate (also called a grid user certificate), from DOEGrids, a U.S. government certificate authority (CA). DOEGrids is recognized by all OSG resources. Other CAs may be used; if your virtual organization (VO) requires that you get a certificate from a different CA, [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000187][contact your VO Support Center]] for instructions. 
&lt;!--This link is secured and performs certificate authentication. I would recommend checking with OIM to verify if all site admins can access the information database--&gt;  

---++ Know your Responsibilities

When you request a certificate your provide some public personal information about yourself; _name, email address, phone number_, and which Registration Authority ( _RA_) affiliation you have (usually OSG), and which _VO_ (virtual organization) you belong to. If any of this information changes after you have your certificate you should notify your RA (and probably VO) of the changes. For the OSG RA send email to osg-ra at opensciencegrid dot org.

Your *name* and *email* address are encoded into the signed certificate and *if either of those change* (usually email address) then you should *request a new certificate* with the correct information and *revoke the old certificate*.

The DOEGrids CA send out notices warning of certificate about to expire starting 30 days before expiration, using the email address provided when you requested the certificate. If you change your working email address then you will not receive the notices and your certificate will probably expire without your knowledge and you will have to request a new certificate instead of being able to use the self service replacement interface to get a new certificate immediately before the old one expires.

If the *information* in the certificate *becomes invalid*, like *email address change*, *name change*, or *private key lost*, then the *certificate should be revoked*. The CA and RA will make some attempt to contact the certificate owner before revoking the certificate but if the email address is bad then it is likely the certificate gets revoked without your knowledge.

---++ Getting your Certificate

There are two different ways to obtain your certificate, either via a command line interface, or through a web browser.  The links below will guide you through whichever method you choose.  The command line method is generally simpler and less prone to errors than using a web browser but it
may require extra setup and package installation the first time you do it.  Most people end up needing their certificate for both command line grid use
and web browser use and it is generally easier to import your certificate into your browser (and email client) from the command line certificate files than to export
your certificate from your web browser to use on the command line.  This is because of the large variety of web browsers each with it&#39;s own way to
deal with certificates.  If you will use the certificate ONLY in your web browser then requesting it from your browser is probably the easiest method.

---++ Revoke your Certificate if Compromised
 If the security of your certificate or private key has been compromised, you have a responsibility to revoke the certificate.  You can follow the steps at the [[CertificateRevoke][Revoking a Certificate]] page to revoke your certificate.  The same instructions apply if you need to revoke a certificate because your email address changed or your name has changed.
