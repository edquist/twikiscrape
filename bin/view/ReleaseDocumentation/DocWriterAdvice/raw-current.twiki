---++ About This Document
This contains for writers of official OSG documentation (or anything else).  These suggestions have proven useful for writers in general.

---++ Advice for Writers
   * Writing is difficult and takes longer than one would expect (kind of like programming).  Plan to devote the necessary time.
   * Write when you are most awake and alert.
   * Before you write, make a layout on paper that shows major sections you want to cover (or use a [[Documentation.DocClassifications#DocumentTypes][template]] that already has suggested sections.
   * It is all too easy to include too much in a document that detracts from the readers understanding and focus.  Say only what is necessary.  (You can refer to more detail by pointing to another document or hide detail that will be used only by a few readers using the %%NOP%TWISTY% variable.)
   * Test your plan for the document against simple use cases.
   * Include &quot;About this Document&quot; at the top to explain what this document is about, who is the target audience, and maybe what the reader will be able to do after reading the document.  This helps the reader determine if this is the right document to meet his/her needs.  This will also help you focus your writing.
   * Make sure the reader is aware of the assumed background or has done the prerequisite steps assumed by your document.
   * When you write a paragraph, ask yourself what the purpose of this paragraph is and what you expect the reader to understand.  
   * After you write the paragraph, repeat the above step.
   * Try to anticipate questions the reader might have and answer them directly in the text or at the bottom as FAQ.
   * Use [[TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki Formatting Commands]] to simplify writing and make the document more readable.
   * Be consistent as possible and use [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationDocFormattingRules][standard formatting]] that makes it easy for readers to interpret the information.
