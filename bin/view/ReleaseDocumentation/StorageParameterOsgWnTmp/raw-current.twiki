---++ Introduction

OSG_WN_TMP is a temporary storage area, local to the worker node and specific to a single job, used as temporary working directory that may be purged when the job completes. Two jobs running on a cluster cannot (generally) read from or write to each other&#39;s OSG_WN_TMP areas. The OSG_WN_TMP area is thus fundamentally different from the others in that it is job-specific.

   * At least 10 GB per virtual CPU should be available in this directory (e.g. a !WorkerNode with 2 hyperthreaded CPUs that can run up to 4 jobs, should have 40GB). 
   * Files placed in this area by a job may be deleted upon completion of the job.

OSG_WN_TMP must point to a POSIX-compliant filesystem that supports links, sockets, locks, pipes and other special files as required. It requires good I/O job performance, so we recommend a local filesystem. Ideally, OSG_WN_TMP should be a temporary directory (or partition) assigned empty for the job, with a well-defined amount of space (many jobs require at least 1-2 GB of disk space), that is purged when the job completes. The space provided should be dedicated and isolated: jobs reusing their own OSG_WN_TMP areas should not affect each other or affect the OS.

In most cases, OSG_WN_TMP points to a space shared among all jobs that are currently executing at the worker node. Therefore, we recommend each job create a unique subdirectory of OSG_WN_TMP (e.g., =OSG_WN_TMP/somestring$JOBSLOT=) that becomes its working area. The job should then remove this subdirectory before it completes,

Sites using _condor_ as their batch system typically implement this by letting condor create the jobs directory prior to launching the job. In those cases, OSG_WN_TMP may be defined in the GIP implicitly by pointing to another environment variable, rather than explicitly by pointing to a full path.

1. A mechanism to help automatic cleanup would be the introduction of a &#39;lock&#39; directories with files named according the temporary directory, containing the PID of the job. If that process is terminated, the directory can be removed
