---++ About This Document

This document contains some general instructions on how a scientist can get electronic credentials that allow
the use of the [[Documentation.WhatIsOSG][Open Science Grid]] (OSG). Getting these credentials
is part of the process of [[Documentation.UsingTheGrid][becoming a new grid user]].
The steps are:
   1. Getting what&#39;s called a [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][certificate]]. 
   1. Registering this certificate with a type of organization known as a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/WhatIsOSG#Virtual_Organizations][VO]] that is authorized to use computers on the grid.

These instructions are mainly for users who do not have credentials.
If you already have a certificate, you probably want to
instead [[MiscellaneousCertificateTasks][renew or replace it]].


---++ Requirements

You first need to know the VO you should join. If you&#39;re not sure,
[[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?all_vos=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;datasource=summary][this list]] may help, or please email the [[mailto:goc@opensciencegrid.org][Grid Operations Center]].

 From your VO you should find out
   1. Whether to use these instructions or some
      VO specific ones instead;
   1. Who to use as your sponsor for the certificate;
   1. The URL for applying for VO membership, the
      sponsor to use, and what group, if any, to request; and
   1. What machine you can use to submit jobs to
      OSG. The VO may need to make you an account on that machine.

These instructions were written for Firefox although
the basic steps are similar for other browsers.

---++ Setting the Master Password (Optional)

To help protect the certificate, it&#39;s best to set
Firefox&#39;s [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Master_password][master password]]. First, go to the Security
submenu under Options/Preferences, which [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][is reachable under]] 
*Tools -&gt; Options* for Windows, 
*Firefox -&gt; Preferences* for Macs, and 
*Edit -&gt; Preferences* for Linux. 
Then click on the &quot;Use a master password&quot; button
and set a password when prompted.
%TWISTY{
showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
}%
%BR%
%ATTACHURL%/set_master_password1.png
%ENDTWISTY{}%
The browser will later ask you for this password
when you use your certificate.

There is more information about protecting grid
credentials [[Documentation.SecurityUserResponsibilities][here]].

---++ Requesting a New User Certificate
    
   1. Start your browser and go to
     https://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/certreg.php.
     Click &quot;Cancel&quot; if there is a pop-up asking you to
     identify yourself with a certificate.  
   1. Install [[Documentation.GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCA][CA certificates]] to let your browser
     recognize DOEgrids. The steps are
      i. click where it says &quot;Install ESnet Root CA in your browser&quot;;
       %TWISTY{
       showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
        hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
        showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
        hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
        }%
        %BR%  
       %ATTACHURL%/installing_DOEgrids_cert_1.png
       %ENDTWISTY{}%
      i. check all of the &quot;Trust this CA&quot; boxes in the
       dialog that comes up, and then click &quot;OK&quot;;
      i. repeat these steps for the link that says
       &quot;Install DOEGrids CA in your browser&quot;.%BR%
   %TWISTY{
       showlink=&quot;Verification&quot;
       hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
       showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
       hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
       }%
      %BR%
     To confirm this step, go to [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -&gt;
     Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt; View Certificates -&gt;
     Authorities, and check that there are entries for
     &quot;DOEGrids CA 1&quot; and &quot;ESnet Root CA 1&quot; under the
     ESnet heading:
     %ATTACHURL%/verify_CA_certificates.png
     %ENDTWISTY{}%
   1. Fill out the form following the instructions
     there. 
   1. After you press Submit, note the request number
     and then wait for a human, the Registration
     Authority, to email you a URL.
   1. Open this URL in the same browser where you made the request,
     and click on the button that says &quot;Import Your Certificate&quot;.
     %BR%
     %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR%  
        %ATTACHURL%/import_your_certificateB.png
     %ENDTWISTY{}%
     Afterwards there should be a pop-up that says:%BR%
       %ATTACHURL%/Certificate_has_been_installed.png  %BR%
     If instead you see%BR%
       %ATTACHURL%/certificate_install_failure.png %BR%
     then most likely you are not using the same
     Firefox that you used to apply for the
     certificate.

     %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Verification&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR% 
     To confirm this step, go to
     [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt;
     View Certificates -&gt; Your Certificates, and see
     that the new certificate is there.
     %ATTACHURL%/seeing_the_new_certificateA.png
     If you double click on the certificate it should say
     that it is issued by &quot;DOEGrids CA 1&quot;.
     %ENDTWISTY{}%
     
---++ VO Registration

  In most cases, you will have to separately apply for
  VO membership. Depending on your VO, you will most
  likely use either a [[Documentation.GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVomrs][VOMRS server]] or a [[Documentation.GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVomsAdmin][VOMS-Admin server]]. Both require that you have your certificate
  before applying.

  Find out the URL of your VO&#39;s VOMRS or VOMS-Admin
  server either from your VO administrator, or the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?all_vos=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1&amp;datasource=summary][list at MyOSG]].

---+++ Registration Using a VOMRS Server

   1. Go to the VOMRS URL. When the browser asks for
     a certificate, select the one we just got.
     The bottom left corner of the page should have
     some red text that says &quot;You are logged in as
     ...&quot;, with your name after &quot;CN=&quot;.
     %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR% 
     %ATTACHURL%/initial_vomrs_registration_page.png
     %ENDTWISTY{}%
   1. Click on &quot;Registration (Phase I)&quot; in the left-hand
     menu bar, and follow the directions there. For
     &quot;Application&quot;, write the program that you plan to
     use most often. You should probably contact the
     representative to let them know about this
     request.
   1. When you get an email from the server, click on
     the enclosed URL and then wait for the
     representative to approve you.

 %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Verification&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR% 
  To confirm this step, return to the VOMRS server,
  select your new certificate when prompted, and you
  should see a page like this:%BR%
  %ATTACHURL%/VO_verification1.png %BR%
  The certificate information shown in red at the
  bottom of the page should correspond to the
  certificate that you registered. Also, the &quot;[+]
  Member Info&quot; line in the menu at the top left of the
  page should be present.%BR%
  Next click on the &quot;[+] Member Info&quot; line, click on
  all the check boxes in the page that comes up, and
  click &quot;Search&quot;. This should bring up all the
  information that the VO has about you.
  %ENDTWISTY{}%

---+++ Registration Using a VOMS-Admin Server
  
   1. Go to the voms-admin URL for your VO. Make sure
      that the DN listed is the one for the certificate
      that you just got, then fill out the form, and
      click &quot;register&quot;. If you should belong to a particular group,
      mention that in the &quot;comments&quot; section.
     %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR%
     %ATTACHURL%/vomsadmin_initial.png
     %ENDTWISTY{}%
   1. Wait for the email from the VOMS-Admin server, and
      click on the URL in it to complete the request.
     %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Screenshot&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR%
     %ATTACHURL%/vomsadmin_request_confirmed.png
     %ENDTWISTY{}%
   1. Wait for an email triggered by a human, the VO
      administrator, saying that you are approved.

  %TWISTY{
     showlink=&quot;Verification&quot;
     hidelink=&quot;Hide&quot;
     showimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%&quot;
     hideimgleft=&quot;%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%&quot;
     }%
     %BR%
   To confirm this step, visit the
   VOMS-Admin server again and check that you get a
   page like this:%BR%
   %ATTACHURL%/vomsadmin_done.png
  %ENDTWISTY{}%

---++ Exporting the Certificate to Disk

To export your certificate,

   1. Open the certificate manager:
     [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt; View Certificates.
   Select the certificate that you would like to export, and press
   &quot;Backup&quot;.
   %ATTACHURL%/cert_manager_selected.png
   1. When prompted, type in the name of the file to hold
   the new certificate. If you name it &quot;usercred.p12&quot;
   then grid programs can automatically recognize it.
   1. When prompted, set a password for the
   certificate. You&#39;ll need this to be able to use the
   certificate later.
   1. After pressing OK, you should see:%BR%
   %ATTACHURL%/cert_export_acknowledgement.png

---++ Transferring the Certificate to the Submit Host

You next need to transfer your certificate to the
machine from which you&#39;ll be submitting jobs, the
_submit host_. 

   1. Find out from your VO the name of a submit host.
   1. One way to do the transfer is with the /scp/ program.
   &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
   $ scp -p usercred.p12 %RED%YOUR_USERNAME@SUBMIT_HOSTNAME:%ENDCOLOR%
   usercred.p12                                   100% 5084     5.0KB/s   00:00&lt;/pre&gt;
   Here you should replace YOUR_USERNAME with your user
   id on the submit host, and SUBMIT_HOSTNAME with the
   name of the submit host. The &quot;@&quot; and &quot;:&quot; symbols are
   important.
     Another way to do the transfer is with [[http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/06/windows-sftp-scp-clients/][a GUI scp/sftp client]].
   1. Log into the remote host:
   &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
   $ ssh %RED%YOUR_USERNAME@SUBMIT_HOSTNAME %ENDCOLOR%&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Make sure that the permissions are correct:
   &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
   $ chmod 400 usercred.p12&lt;/pre&gt;
   1. Make a directory called &quot;.globus&quot;, and move the
   certificate into that directory:
   &lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
   $ mkdir .globus 
   $ mv usercred.p12 .globus/&lt;/pre&gt;

The next steps are to [[Documentation.UserTestingResource][run a test job]],
and then [[Documentation.UsingTheGrid#Running_Jobs][real jobs]].
