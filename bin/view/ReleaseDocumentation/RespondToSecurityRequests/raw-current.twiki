---++ About This Document
This document covers information on how sites can respond to security incidents.

---++ Introduction
In many ways, the most important security requirement for running a site is that you communicate with the OSG Security Officer and the [[Security.SecurityTeamMembers][Security Team]].  When issues come up or incidents occur there is usually some manual intervention required and this means reading email from the OSG security team or taking phone calls (in the most urgent cases).  In order to be sure that OSG can communicate with the site administrator responsible for security of a site there is the periodic update of contact information in [[OIMSecurityContactInfo][OIM]].

If you have confidential information to provide to the OSG security team, it can be sent via [[SecureEmail][encrypted email]] or submitted as a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/security][security ticket to the GOC]] (requires a registered X509 certificate in your browser). Of course, you can always use the telephone as well for secure communications (call the [[Operations/WebHome][GOC]] or [[Security.SecurityTeamMembers][individual security team members]]). 

%NOTE%Anything you tell OSG security team in confidentiality will be kept confidential. We will not share it with any other parties, including other sites, VOs, and OSG management. Of course, if the preservation of the information presents an imminent threat against the security of OSG, we may need to share it with other parties.  BUT, before doing that we will inform you first, and decide how much to disclose and how to disclose the information.
