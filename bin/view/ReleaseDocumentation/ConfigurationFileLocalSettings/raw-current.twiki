---+ Introduction to Local Settings Section

This section gives information about the Local Settings section.  

---++ Options

This section differs from other sections in that there are no set options in this section.  Rather, the options set in this section will be placed in the =osg-local-job-environment.conf= verbatim.  The options in this section are case sensitive and the case will be preserved when they are converted to environment variables.  

For example adding a line such as =My_Setting = my_Value= would result in the an environment variable called =My_Setting= set to =my_Value= being set in the environment when =osg-local-job-environment.conf= is sourced.  For example, to add a variable =MY_PATH= set to =/usr/local/myapp=, you&#39;d have the following:
&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
[Local Settings]

MY_PATH = /usr/local/myapp
&lt;/pre&gt;

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
  * One major review comment: After reading this page I know that the variable I set in the [Local Settings] section will be in osg-local-job-environment.conf. But the reader will not know what that means. Would that mean it will be in the environment variable of all jobs running on his site, or will the jobs have to source setup.sh. I understand that the level of detail I am asking for may not be appropriate for this section. If so, you should still have links to the page explaining the role of osg-local-job-environment.conf.
