---++ Information Often Needed by People Who Can Assist You
The Debugging Information Section of each Install Document is generally providing suggestions on the files to look or the information to provide to the troubleshooters.

In addition, if you have problems with your OSG or VDT installation you should run the system profiler:&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
vdt-system-profiler&lt;/pre&gt;
And return the file =vdt-profile.txt= together with your ticket submission or email request.

---++ OSG Documents
On the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][OSG Web Site]] you can find pointers to technical documentation, monitoring, events and general information.
The [[Main.WebHome][OSG Twiki]] is the main documentation hub, specially the [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][Release documentation Web]] containing documents about the current release.
&lt;!-- [[Documentation.WebHome][]] --&gt;

---++ VO Assistance
If your VO provides user support, that should be your first line of support because it is more familiar with your applications and requirements.
If not, below there are OSG support resources.

The list of support contacts for OSG VOs can be found in the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/scsummary/index?datasource=summary&amp;summary_attrs_showdesc=on&amp;summary_attrs_showcontact=on&amp;all_scs=on&amp;active=on&amp;active_value=1][MyOSG Support Center Tab]].

&lt;!-- Please add  or edit VOHelpResources  for VO support information
