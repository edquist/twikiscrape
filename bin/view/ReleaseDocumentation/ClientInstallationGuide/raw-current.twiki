%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users and system administrators. It covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools Package. This package is required on every host used by grid users to submit jobs, transfer data, or interact otherwise with the OSG. The [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationWorkerNodeClient][Worker Node client]] is not a valid substitute for this package and the OSG Client cannot replace the Worker node client in the batch jobs environment on %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%.  

The OSG Cient Tools Package includes:

   * the %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% providing client tools for authorization, data transfer and job submission.
   * a list of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCertificate][Certificates]] trusted by the OSG.
   * the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCRL][Certificate Revocation List]] and tools to keep it current.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% client tools for job submission and workflow management.
   * client tools to access a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM% provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%.

%NOTE%This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][here]].

---+ Engineering Considerations

The OSG Client Tools Package is required on hosts used to submit jobs to the Open Science Grid. We recommend to install the OSG Client Tools on a _dedicated_ job submission host for large scale job submissions to production resources on the OSG. Grid users may install the package as _non-root_ users. If the client tools are to be shared among users on the job submission host, the installation should be performed by the _root_ user. We recommend to use a [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Public_IP_Address_and_DNS][public IP address and a fully qualified domain name]] for shared job submission hosts. Personal clients, specially is not used to submit long running jobs with Condor-G have no special network recommendations.

System administrators installing the OSG Client Tools in a shared location that serves hosts of mixed x86_64 and i686 architectures should consider to [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Sharing_the_Installation_between][force]] the installation of the version for %RED%i686%ENDCOLOR% architecture.


---+ How to get Help?

To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][this page]].


---+ Requirements

   1 verify that your operating system is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]].
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION% or later.
   1 if you enable Gram WS (disabled by default) a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required.
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required.


---+ Installation Procedure

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 deactivate an existing installation. I.e start the installation with a clean environment
   1 create an empty installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the OSG Client Tools Package
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 configure logfile rotation and automatic updates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 Enable %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% to support Condor-G Job Submissions

---++ Deactivate an existing Installation

Before you proceed with an update you must [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Deactivation][deactivate]] an existing installation to avoid to have leftover processes. Make sure to start the installation with a clean environment. If VDT_LOCATION is in your environment you probably need to log-out and log-in again and make sure that no setup file is sourced in your login scripts.

Note that multiple client installation on the same host are possible and do not interfere with each other if they do not compete for the same resources (e.g. update of the same certificate directory, or use cron jobs of the same user). This can be useful to allow multiple personal installations on a client host or to test a new version. Anyway each installation must be performed with a clean environment.


---++ Create the Installation Directory

Create an empty installation directory and change into it. Make sure the directory is world readable if the installation is to be shared by grid users: 

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ mkdir -p %UCL_CWD%
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ cd %UCL_CWD%
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++ Use Pacman to install the OSG Client Tools Package

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to &quot;trust the caches and accept the license&quot;, answer =yall= and =y= to install OSG client.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
Do you want to add [http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

INFO: The Globus-Base-Info-Client package is not supported on this platform
The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2.10 has been installed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
%ENDTWISTY%

The installation logfile can be found in =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log=. To complete the installation update your environment and run the post installation script:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% source setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-post-install 
Starting...
Done.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Further information about the installation process and what software has been installed can be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Debugging_Information][here]].

---++ Update the Environment

Depending on your shell update your environment by sourcing =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= or =%UCL_CWD%/setup.csh=:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% . %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

Depending on your preference you might want to optionally include the setup script in your system or user profile.


%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall&quot; section=&quot;InstallTheOSGCACertificateAuthorityPackage&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;&quot;}%

Some more information and different installation options are described in the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationGuide#CA_Certificates_and_CRL][advanced section]] below.

---++ Configure Logfile Rotation and Automatic Updates

To keep your [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% current we will add an entry to =cron= requesting periodic updates. We also recommend to setup logfile rotation using =vdt-control= at the command line:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-control --enable %RED%fetch-crl vdt-update-certs vdt-rotate-logs%ENDCOLOR% 
running &#39;vdt-register-service --name fetch-crl --enable&#39;... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running &#39;vdt-register-service --name vdt-update-certs --enable&#39;... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running &#39;vdt-register-service --name vdt-rotate-logs --enable&#39;... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% =vdt-control --enable= will only _register_ the services requested to be run by =cron=. To actually run the services and create the necessary entries in =crontab=, the services still have to be [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][activated]].

---++ Enable Condor to support Condor-G Job Submissions

Large scale production job submissions require a capable scheduler submitting jobs to grid resources and monitoring their status. Enabling support for %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% on the submission host is all that is required to create a local grid queue on your submission host: 

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable condor
running &#39;vdt-register-service --name condor --enable&#39;... ok
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% This will copy the =condor= script to =/etc/init.d= and requires _root_ privileges. Please follow [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Manually_Start_and_Stop_Condor][these instructions]] if you are a _non-root_ user!

---++ Advanced Configuration Options

Completing the steps outlined above will install a fully functional OSG Client. The following section discusses optional and advanced configuration options.   

---+++ CA Certificates and CRL

%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall&quot; section=&quot;InstallACertificateAuthorityPackage&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;++&quot;}%
%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall&quot; section=&quot;UseAnExistingCAInstallation&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;++&quot;}%

---+++  Firewall Considerations

The %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% require the client host to _allow_ inbound and outbound network connections. This section describes what additional configuration steps have to be taken if the client host is located behind a firewall. For a more detailed description on firewalls consult [[ComputeElementFirewalls][this]] document.

---++++ Public IP Address and DNS
If you use the the client host as Condor-G submit host for long running jobs, it needs to be reached by remote resources. The easier option is to use a _public_ IP address and not be be located within a private network. For other options check below. To make sure that the client host uses a public IP address and is assigned a fully qualified domain name, use:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% hostname -f
%RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% nslookup %UCL_HOST_FQDN%
Server:		131.215.125.1
Address:	131.215.125.1#53

Name:           %RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
Address:        %RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the client host is not assigned a fully qualified domain name, you can assign the _public IP address_ to the =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% echo &quot;export GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=%RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%&quot; &gt;&gt; %UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
%UCL_PROMPT% source setup.sh
&lt;/pre&gt; 

%NOTE% It is possible to use a client host that is located inside a private network using Network Address Translation. In this case the gatekeeper must be configured to forward incoming connections to the client host. The =$GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable must be set to the gatekeeper address. This procedure is currently not documented.

---++++ Globus Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% can be configured to only use a specified range of TCP ports on the client host for inbound (=$GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=) and outbound (=$GLOBUS_TCP_PORTRANGE=) connections.

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% echo &quot;export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%20000,22499%ENDCOLOR%&quot; &gt;&gt; %UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
%UCL_PROMPT% echo &quot;export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%22500,25000%ENDCOLOR%&quot; &gt;&gt; %UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% source setup.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

---++++ Condor Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% will only use a specified range of TCP ports for inbound and outbound connections on the client host that is configured in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $CONDOR_CONFIG 
%UCL_CWD%/condor/etc/condor_config
&lt;/pre&gt;

Please un-comment and adjust the definitions for =LOWPORT= and =HIGHPORT= in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%LOWPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#LOWPORT = 9600
%UCL_PROMPT% cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%HIGHPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#HIGHPORT = 9700 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Restart Condor as the _root_ user in order for the settings to take effect:

&lt;pre class=&quot;rootscreen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/init.d/condor stop
Shutting down Condor
Sent &quot;Kill-Daemon&quot; command for &quot;master&quot; to local master
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/init.d/condor start
Starting up Condor
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% Please follow [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Manually_Start_and_Stop_Condor][these instructions]] to restart Condor if you are a _non-root_ user!


---+++ Sharing the Installation between 32Bit and 64Bit Clients

%ICON{hand}% This section is for System Administrators that require the OSG Client Package to be setup in a _shared_ location and which will be used by hosts with different architectures, 32 and 64 bit. In this case and if the host used for the installation is 64Bit host, then a 32Bit installation has to be forced using a command line option to %LINK_PACMAN%.

%NOTE% This procedure requires the installation of *32Bit Compatibility Libraries* on all 64Bit clients!

To _force_ the installation of the 32Bit OSG Client Package simply provide the =-pretend-arch i686= command line option to the =pacman= command:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% pacman %RED%-pretend-arch i686%ENDCOLOR% -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
Do you want to add [http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% pacman -pretend-arch i686 -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
Do you want to add [http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): yall
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       
All prerequisite checks are satisfied.

in the post-install/README file.
                                                                              
The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.    
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2.10 has been installed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
%ENDTWISTY%

and continue to follow the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Install_the_CA_Certificates_and][instructions]].


---+ Activate and Deactivate Services
%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices&quot; section=&quot;About&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;+&quot;}%
%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices&quot; section=&quot;List&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;+&quot;}%
%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices&quot; section=&quot;Activate&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;+&quot;}%
%INCLUDE{&quot;ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices&quot; section=&quot;Deactivate&quot; TOC_SHIFT=&quot;+&quot;}%

---++ Manually Start and Stop Condor

A _non-root_ user doesn&#39;t have the permissions to add %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% to the =init= daemon. In this case Condor needs to be started and stopped _manually_ by the user.

_Start_ Condor by using the =condor_master= command:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_master
&lt;/pre&gt;

_Stop_ Condor by using the =condor_off= command:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_off %RED%-master%ENDCOLOR%
Sent &quot;Kill-Daemon&quot; command for &quot;master&quot; to local master
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+ Setup the Client

As all the software installed via Pacman, OSG-Client creates a self contained installation and each time you want to use the software included in OSG-Client you *must source the setup file*. There is one setup file for each major Unix shell, e.g. for sh and bash:
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% source %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

---+ Test the Client

This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][here]].

To simply test the functionality of your installation:

   * prepare your environment by sourcing =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= 
   * make sure your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is installed on the client host
   * make sure you [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][activated]] the installation
   * create a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_Grid_Prox][grid-proxy]] to test that your certificate is valid
   * create a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_VOMS_Prox][voms-proxy]]
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][authenticate]] with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Job_Submission_using_GRAM][submit a job]] using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Data_Transfer_Test][transfer data]] using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%


---+ Troubleshooting

You may use the =vdt-version= command to display information about all software packages that have been installed:

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-version

You have installed a subset of VDT version 2.0.0p17:
