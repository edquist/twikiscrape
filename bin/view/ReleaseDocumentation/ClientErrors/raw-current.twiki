%STARTSECTION{&quot;GramErrors&quot;}%
---%SHIFT%+ Globus Gram Client Errors

There may be several reasons causing a client side error condition. These are a list of the known ones.

---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 47

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%, but the assigned Unix account does not exist on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run cms-xen1.fnal.gov:2119/jobmanager-fork /bin/date
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to run the job manager (%RED%error code 47%ENDCOLOR%)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The GRAM log file on the Compute Element =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= will contain an entry indicating the missing Unix account:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
TIME: Tue Feb 27 09:51:34 2007
 PID: 16564 -- Failure: getpwname() failed to find uscmspool591
&lt;/pre&gt;

---%SHIFT%+ Globus GRAM-WS Client Errors

---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 200

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM_WS%, but the =/etc/sudoers= file is misconfigured on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun-ws -submit -F cms-xen1.fnal.gov:9443 -Ft Fork -c /bin/date
Submitting job...Done.
Job ID: uuid:5d85bb28-c67c-11db-ac3b-00163e010001
Termination time: 02/28/2007 16:05 GMT
Current job state: Failed
Destroying job...Done.
globusrun-ws: Job failed: %RED%Error code: 200%ENDCOLOR%
Sudo is misconfigured to run the globus-job-manager-script.pl script for user uscmspool591.
ERROR: Job FAILED with return code (255)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The GRAM-WS log file on the Compute Element =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container.log= will contain an entry:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
2007-02-27 10:02:32,138 INFO  exec.StateMachine [RunQueueThread_15,logJobAccepted:3492]

     exec.StateMachine [RunQueueThread_15,createFaultFromErrorCode:3264] 
     Unhandled fault %RED%code 200%ENDCOLOR%
&lt;/pre&gt;

The misconfiguration is likely associated with first entry in the =/etc/sudoers= file which is associated with authorizations for the globus-ws container user:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
%UCL_CWD%/globus/libexec/globus-job-manager-script.pl *
&lt;/pre&gt;

---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 201

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM_WS%, but the assigned Unix account does not exist on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

---%SHIFT%++ Invalid File Permissions on STDOUT

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSART_GRAM_WS%, but the =/etc/sudoers= file is misconfigured on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. The error will only occur when output is _streamed_ back to the client as either stdout/stderr or in the form of a file:

&lt;pre class=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;

globusrun-ws: Job failed: %RED%Invalid file permissions on stdout%ENDCOLOR% /fd40d51c-c67c-11db-ae39-00163e010001.0.stdout.
starter: the job manager failed to open stdout
ERROR: Job FAILED with return code (255)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The GRAM-WS log file on the Compute Element =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container.log= will contain an entry:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
2007-02-27 10:10:11,655 INFO  authorization.ServiceAuthorizationChain 
      [RunQueueThread_1,authorize:285] Authorized &quot;/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491&quot;

2007-02-27 10:10:18,309 ERROR service.TransferWork [WorkThread-3389,run:724] Terminal transfer error:

  [Nested exception message:  Custom message: Unexpected reply: 500-Command failed :

&lt;b&gt;.... followed by a java stacktrace.....&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The misconfiguration is likely associated with _second_ entry in the =/etc/sudoers= file which is associated with the processing of the delegated proxy for the globus-ws container user:

&lt;pre class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
%UCL_CWD%/globus/libexec/globus-gram-local-proxy-tool *
&lt;/pre&gt;

%NOTE% After the =/etc/sudoers= file is corrected, a restart of the =globus-ws= container will be required to effect the change.
