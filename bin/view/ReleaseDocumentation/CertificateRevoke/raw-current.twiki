---++ About This Document
These are the steps to take if you need to revoke a certificate.  Whether you are an end user and have discovered that your certificate was compromised, or a system administrator who needs to revoke one or many certificates that were discovered to be compromised.

---++ End user revoking a certificate
If you think that your certificate has been compromised in any way then it is the safest bet to go ahead and revoke your certificate and get a new one.  Using the web browser where your certificate and private key are installed, go to the [[http://www.doegrids.org/][DOEGrids site]], choose &quot;Certificate Revocation&quot;, and follow the instructions. You can get a new one afterward from the same location.  There are currently no options to revoke a certificate from the command line.  If your certificate has not been installed in your browser yet you can follow the install instructions at [[CertificateGetWeb][Get or renew a certificate using a web browser]].

---++ System administrator revoking a certificate(s)
If you are a system administrator and have discovered that one (or more) user certificates on your system have been compromised then you will need to have these certificates revoked.  Users can revoke their own certificates, but only a Registration Authority Agent (RAA) for a Certificate Authority (CA) can revoke a certificate not owned by them.  So you will need to determine what CA&#39;s the certificates on your system belong to and then contact a RAA for that CA and have them revoke the certificates for you.
