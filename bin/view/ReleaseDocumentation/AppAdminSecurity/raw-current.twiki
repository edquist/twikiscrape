   * ensure that the software installation procedures follow all posted OSG security policies and procedures (see the [[Security.WebHome][OSG security pages]] for more details);
   * ensure that the software installation procedures follow all posted site-specific security policies and procedures for those sites where the software is installed and run (see each site&#39;s entry on [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/][MyOSG]]);
   * ensure that their software and the installation and execution thereof is consistent with the VO&#39;s own posted policies, procedures and purpose (which should be posted and up to date on [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/][MyOSG]]);
   * promptly follow the [[IncidentDiscoveryReporting][incident reporting procedures]] in the event that a security problem is discovered.
