---++ GIP Meeting
   * Attendees: Burt, Suchandra, Tony, Brian
   * Apologies: Gabriele, Tanya, Parag (meeting conflict)

---++ Current issues
   * The =GlueCEInfoDefaultSE= parameter is set to =UNAVAILABLE= in the case of a &quot;classic SE&quot; configuration (the SE is the gatekeeper&#39;s disk).  This is flagged as an issue with the GIP validation tool at http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu.  This seems to be a bug in =configure_gip=.  Tony will investigate and fix if necessary.

---++ SE attribute discussion
   * Paths get set in three different stanzas.
&lt;verbatim&gt;
dn: GlueSALocalID=$vo,GlueSEUniqueID=$se_host
   GlueSARoot = $vo:$se_access_root
   GlueSAPath = $se_access_root

dn: GlueVOInfoLocalID=$vo,GlueSALocalID=$vo,GlueSEUniqueID=$se_host
   GlueVOInfoPath: $se_access_root

dn:  GlueCESEBindSEUniqueID=$se_host, GlueCESEBindGroupCEUniqueID=$fullhost:2119/jobmanager-$batch-$queue
   GlueCESEBindCEAccesspoint: $disk (for disk only)  OR
   GlueCESEBindCEAccesspoint: $sa_path   (for simplified SRM) OR
   GlueCESEBindCEAccesspoint: $sa_path/$se_access{$vo}  (otherwise)
&lt;/verbatim&gt;

Glue 1.3 deprecates =GlueSARoot= and =GlueCESEBindCEAccesspoint=.  Additionally, it requires =GlueCESEBindMountInfo= be populated in the =GlueCESEBindSEUniqueID= stanza.

Recommendations:
   * Set =GlueSARoot = /=
   * Check EGEE implementation of =GlueVOInfoPath= and attempt to match
   * Set =GlueCESEBindCEAccesspoint= to =$sa_path= for both SRM cases

None of these are showstoppers for OSG 1.0 currently.

---++ Glue 2.0
This will be a significant change.  It&#39;s not clear at all how we will handle this operationally since it is not backwards-compatible with Glue 1.x.  Will EGEE maintain two separate BDIIs? Will there be a hard cutoff date?  Can we avoid early-adopter problems and still be interoperable?  Burt will take this up with Ruth since discussions need to happen at the management level.

---++ OSG 1.2
GIP developers will send on their &quot;to-do&quot; and wishlists (as well as stuff that may already be developed but not ready for OSG 1.0).  Burt will integrate the lists and talk to the OSG ET to see where everything fits in on the Blueprint.  Once OSG 1.0 is cut, we should be able to put together a blueprint and priority list based on these inputs.
