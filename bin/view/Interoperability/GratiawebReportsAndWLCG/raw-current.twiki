%TOC%

---++ Description
Initially, this topic will be a working document to define the requirements for a re-vamped version 
of the current gratiaweb WLCG summary pages.  The production version is currently broke so we will use the 
ITB version of the pages:
   * ITB %WLCG_REPORTING_OVERVIEW%
   * ITB %WLCG_REPORTING_DETAILED%

I would think that these pages should be a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; page for all WLCG reporting metrics.  It not, please correct.
We can also provide links describing how the metrics are calculated on the %WLCG_INTEROPERABILITY% twiki.

Lines in %RED%red%ENDCOLOR% indicates some major  changes to the current report pages and/or questions.

As this nears a production state, this doc should migrate into the documentation for these urls.

%BR%%RED%Currently we are only displaying Tier 2 federations and we should be showing all federations/resource groups 
involved in WLCG interoperability.  Tier 1 resource groups should be included.%ENDCOLOR%


---++ WLCG Reporting Detailed
This %WLCG_REPORTING_DETAILED% page displays WLCG metric data for the WLCG Federation for Tier 1 and Tier 2 OSG resource groups for
the OSG !VOs reporting to WLCG.
%BR%%RED%Currently, this is organized by Site, actually resource group, and I propose we show it grouped like the %WLCG_REPORTING_OVERVIEW% page%ENDCOLOR%%BR%

%RED%
I think we agreed that these sections are being dropped:
   * GIP Subcluster Summary
   * Site Normalization Factors
   * Available Data Summary
If the above are deprecated, is there any purpose for the gratia bdii probe and the population of the SubCluster table in Nebraska.
%ENDCOLOR%

%RED%
Also, I think the WLCG Pledge Information section which summarizes by Federation only should probably be on the %WLCG_REPORTING_OVERVIEW% page.
%ENDCOLOR%


These would be the sections for the detailed WLCG reporting:
   * Accounting Data
   * Installed Capacity (CPU and Storage)
   * Availability / Reliability
   * ??? what other metric ??

---+++ Accounting Data
This data can come directly from the Gratia-APEL interface page: &lt;nop&gt;http://gr13x6.fnal.gov:8319/gratia-apel//2013-05.
[[http://gr13x6.fnal.gov:8319/gratia-apel//2013-05.summary.dat][summary.dat]]
([[http://gr13x6.fnal.gov:8319/gratia-apel//2013-05.summary.html][summary.html]])
   * This shows the basic data that is sent to the  APEL-EGI accounting portal.
   * The addition of the &quot;resource&quot; column allows visibility into the individual resource being reported.
   * The addition of &quot;federation&quot; column provides a better means of relating to the data on the &quot;Overview&quot; page.

---+++ Installed Capacity
%RED%
Currently not being shown anywhere. Maybe by email but why not here.
Once someone figures out how it is calculated, it will be documented here: %INSTALLED_CAPACITY%
%ENDCOLOR%

I added the CPU and Storage sections below based on what I see here: http://gstat-wlcg.cern.ch/apps/capacities/federations/
---++++ CPU
---++++ Storage

---+++ Availability / Reliability
I am assuming this data comes from http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/2013/05/31 for the appropriate time period.
 %RED%
   * If the data comes from the url above, how do we get ALICE data.
   * How do we know what resources within a resource group are used to determine the value on the rsv page.
   * How does this get summarized on the %WLCG_REPORTING_OVERVIEW% page
   * I am assuming also that this availability/reliability is related to %SITE_MONITORING% and details of how this is calculated can be documented here.

---++ WLCG Reporting Overview
This page displays summarized WLCG metric data by  WLCG Federation for Tier 1 and Tier 2 OSG resource groups for
the OSG !VOs reporting to WLCG.  This represents a summation by WLCG Federation of the data shown on the %WLCG_REPORTING_DETAILED% page.

%RED%
Once we agree on the detail page data, then we can determine how the overview page would look.
And I ran out of time today and wanted to get this out for comments.
