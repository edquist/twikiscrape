    &lt;li&gt;Web space -- we can read but can&#39;t (yet) write. Antonio will investigate. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gLite validation by Jan 23 - Nick will talk to Andrea Sciaba about using his CMS SAM tests for testing the latest gLite UI/WMS release. If the desired gLite version is deployed on the PPS, Tony is available to do testing by hand as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt; OPS tests on OSG ITB sites - Emanouil had issues with UCSD, Caltech, BNL and filed tickets, problems solved. However only Fermigrid, BNL, and U of Chicago are guaranteed to be responsive, he will limit tests to those three. We&#39;ll (BH) clarify the support chain for those ITB sites.
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;lcg-cr doesn&#39;t work just about anywhere, but it&#39;s not supported on OSG. Emanouil will send around his tests so we can see where it breaks and help determine if this is something to support in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Information system - In short/medium term, only plans are to do performance tuning -- current infrastructure will meet EGEE goals. OSG is planning to add attributes outside of the Glue Schema and filtering them out at the OSG BDII; Laurence advises utilizing available free-form fields such as RuntimeEnvironment? (and also mentioned he is always available for questions and advice). - Glue 2.0 draft will get circulated and approved over next few OGFs, OSG should look &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
