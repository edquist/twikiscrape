---++ Topics of Discussion
   * Several sites - CERN included tried to upgrade to the EMI 1 release of the WN client
   * CMS jobs pick up some stuff from WN client and the versions are different between the glite and EMI (e.g. globus).  This caused CMS jobs to fail.
   * Failure reasons are:
      * gliteWMS treats all GT5 sites as GT2
         * Condor will be updated to the appropriate version in EMI Release 2
      * EMI WMS sometimes sends jobs to sites with very short (10-30 minute) proxies.   This causes temporary failures at OSG 1.2 sites, but triggers a bug in OSG 3 that causes the lcgadmin user to see continuous failures.
         * Work around in place - set MYPROXY server to a specially crafted value
         * glite devs will fix bug and make it easier to configure behavior
      * The condor_gridmanager in EMI WMS is crashing periodically, causing test jobs to not make it to the site within the 55 minute timeout.
         * This is a bug in Condor-G with the new ARC servers
