---++ Topics of Discussion
   * Are there any software tools that make assumptions about the contents of GlueSEUniqueID?
     Is it assumed that the unique id is the hostname and only the hostname?
      * LCG Utils are the only clients that might break - Steve T.
      * Emmanouil&#39;s test use them for his interop testing, no problems seen so far.
      * Need to check the entire BDII reporting change from OSG to WLCG. - Tony

   * CREAM CE Testing: Latest ICE release broke the install. 

   * Interoperability work
      * Possible cleanup of the ITB OIM registrations needed
      * gLite WMS servers are returning errors.  Once they are back, the glideinWMS can be configured
        to use the PPS-CERN sites as well as the sites Emanouil will send via email.

   * WN environment
      * how do you determine subcluster information once a job lands on a worker node?  What other properties are exposed?
         * Desired for publishing software tags to the subcluster.
         * Desired for determining the speed of the node to determine how much time a job has left

   * Generic setup for worker nodes
      * OSG has done nothing
         * The only thing that is guaranteed is $OSG_GRID which points to the worker client where we can execute the setup.sh
         * The jobs can choose to execute it to get the common tools
      * EGEE populates Glue with the names of the variables for the VO&#39;s info.  
         * Once on the worker, expand the variable and you get the actual information.
         * There is a minimal environment set automatically on EGEE worker nodes
         * Argues that VO stuff should not be mixed with general stuff

   * Glexec updates
      * status update for scripts that preserve environment across processes
      * send to list - version in PPS and status of changes in PPS

---++  Action Items
   * send to list - version in PPS and status of changes in PPS
