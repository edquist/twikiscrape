---++ Topics of Discussion
   * CREAM-CE
      * No response to Nick&#39;s query with regards to Condor-G submission status.  It is a work in progress
      * according to Antonio - CMS doesn&#39;t want to run glideinWMS on CREAM!??? (Note: not true, this was a misunderstanding)
      * EGI isn&#39;t pushing to integrate CREAM with OSG
      * Condor Utils RPMs for SL5 x86_64 are missing completely Nick will follow up

   * Glue Schema
      * What are the wlcg-mandated requirements on glue attributes such as country name?  Is there a place where these requirements are maintained?
         * no such document for &quot;WLCG profile&quot;
         * Storage Capacity document is only authoratative list
         * needs to be documented
   * Glue 2.0
        * This is a long term thing - no planned rollout for the near future

   * With the PPS being phased out and the Staged-Rollout model being implemented, where is the authoritative list of sites participating and the components that they are testing?
